&amp;#x200B;

So recently my friends and I have playing a lot, we've ran each mission enough times to no even look at our main screens while completing them. We're rapidly getting more bored each day we play. I'm sure we aren't the only people with that problem. While yes Massive is slowly leaking content. We would like to see some content like underground from Div 1.

The thing is, I'm passionate about the game and grinded way too hard and got bored. That's my fault. I used the glitch fully aware that I would be banned and I'm glad massive is taking a stand because, again, I chose to use it.

What I'm not okay with is the fact that the expansion which we all paid for is in such a horrible enough state that a glitch like that STILL EXISTS.

Bugged skills, hitreg problems, horrible server ticks, EA-level ""accomplishment"" loot system and more.

I'm just surprised that people are so upset over being banned when most of us logged on and spent more time pissed off over bugs.

fsnuqh,NLK3187,Did The Pentagon mission get it's difficulty quietly lowered?,"First off I'm a fairly casual solo player with 189 hours on record and I don't normally play above hard difficulty (and that's a recent change) so maybe the problem with the mission ""The Pentagon"" is me I'm not sure, but I replayed it today as part of the event to take down Venus and it is like night and day when comparing it to my original experience.

My first playthrough was hellish and took me about twenty tries on just the story difficulty (thanks and fuck you, quadcopter!). Honestly infuriated me enough to decide to was never playing that mission again.

Today, after griping a bit that I was forced to suffer through it again, I played it as part of the season event on normal difficulty and just... breezed through it, first time, took about twenty odd minutes. Insert shocked look here...

Has Massive quietly decided that it was too hard and nerfed the whole mission? Or just the quadcopter?

fsmxwu,WickedWiggins,A massive mistake for this player base,"Revive Hive glitch

Bullet sponges

Invisible insta death gas

Gear set issues


The list can go on and on. Mistakes are a common thing in many video games. I want to start by saying I love the Division, I love this community, and I love the content they’ve put out over the years. However, this does not excuse the leaps and bounds of logic that massive has made in the last 24 hours. I’ll cut to the chase. To simply put it, Massive you shouldn’t have gone and banned all those players. I’ve already read hundreds of testimonies of people claiming they didn’t do the bug and they got banned or people that did and they’re account is just fine. There are so many issues with this game. There are so many bugs to certain gear types and skills. For Pete’s sake the reviver hive glitch is still in the game. A player can go down and not be revived by his hive or his team. What the hell? However, you seem to think it’s fair to ban these players who simply took advantage of a DPS glitch. Look I get it, if you used the DPS glitch and you were struttin’ around the DZ one shotting other players, I think you deserved the ban. However if you were just using it to grind through missions a bit faster, to level up a little quicker, or to try that harder content well... you shouldn’t be banned. Maybe a slap on the wrist but not a ban and rollback. I’ve read stories that people attempted the glitch once for maybe an hour or so and then played normally afterwards and still got banned. Imagine playing for hours and grinding to get your gear just to be reset because you were curious about a glitch... This was a mistake massive. To be quite honest I’m not sure how large the player base is in the division 2, but I can guarantee you it will surely reduce after this ban and rollback is over. For the future I believe the proper way to handle this would be: 

1st strike: Banned for 7 days

2nd strike: gear rollbacks

3rd strike: perma ban 

I’ve heard talk that there are already threats of perma bans and I hope that’s not the case. If you implemented a system like this it would probably encourage players to not use glitches or exploits. (Or maybe if you played your own game and realized how unfair the difficulty scaling can be there would be no need for frivolous DPS glitches) 

PLEASE UNDERSTAND, if you were banned for glitching I’m sincerely sorry. I have over 20 or so DAYS played on this game so I would be incredibly disappointed if I was banned. I’m sorry if anyone out there was affected. Feel free to share your comments or ideas. My idea for 3 strikes might be flawed so I’d love to hear more ideas from everyone.

I'm currently doing full glass cannon lmg build with bullet king (finally got lucky and got one with max rolled dmg and somewhat good other 2 stats). I was thinking about running gunner but everytime I pull out the minigun I just get smashed so hard (no wonder with tak sweet +60% damage taken lol) and rest of the spec that benefits the lmgs the most (extra mag and that fast reloading or what it is perk) is kinda pointless since bullet king has no mag. So I thought about survivalist. And I like it - the extra healing helping me survive a little longer and the fire grenades. And I can use the crossbow without being smashed to the ground. But then I realized this spec is mostly used for skill/support builds and not LMG glass cannon dps so now I just don't know what to pick.

fsmlbg,TrueKing,You Picked The Wrong Time....,"I don't know why you didn't fix it vs patching every other glitch that works in the player's favor in lightning speed but fine. I don't know why you would release WONY in such a sorry state but we players stayed and grinded; mostly for nothing but fine.  
There have been so many game-breaking glitches that have been allowed to fester, one-shot NPC, revive glitch, etc that WE players have played through.   


However, I don't know who thought a week-long ban was a great idea during a pandemic when everyone was stuck home but fine. Not only did you ban players who used it, but you also banned players who didn't but were in the same party or matched into a session. I can live with the ban, it means I don't have to give an unbelievable amount of time to DIV2 and expect anything. I bought DIV2 on day 1 and still don't have all the cosmetics because of all the duplicates but fine.  


If we're being honest, most of us got nothing worth our time from drops even with the DPS glitch. Using it made the game actually fun again which should tell you something. I do take issue with the rollback because a lot of people didn't use it until a few days before it was patched if at all. The loot drops are horrible even when going after targeted loot! Yet, nothing is done. There is little to anything to do vs DIV1.

fsmfo0,strizzl,I think the exploiters missed a key point,"With the balancing changes, heroic content with a proper team “tank , healer, dps, cc” is actually fun! It requires team work. The fun is the challenge and team work. Loot is a byproduct of the journey. 

I remember back in WoW I actually enjoyed BRD runs when crowd control was well executed or a healer made a last second save or a hunter pulled a novel kite. Been running heroics with real team compositions has been a real joy. I actually like the missions again. If you got a rare drop it was a cherry on the run that enhanced the experience: it was not the experience. 

If you glitch and blow through content to just get loot, you miss out on the fun. 

For those who still run 4 DPS compositions, I highly encourage you to try proper team compositions for heroics. I think you’ll be surprised at how different this game feels. It is highly satisfying. Gear 2.0 and WONY with it had made me enjoy PVE for the first time in division 2. Overall, I’ve been really happy with WONY despite some bugs and an very grateful that massive did the roll back on the exploiters. The ban I could care less about. The fact that individuals who used a glitch to get their gear are getting their gear removed is fair. Furthermore, folks who have all god tier builds from exploiting: realistically, what is left for them to play anyways? Again, it’s about the journey. You need a white whale to chase in a looter shooter / rpg. 

TLDR; the point of the game is the journey. Getting all endgame gear without really “playing the game” robs the user of the experience.

I currently have an older machine:

Is the ram the issue of the game crashing before opening? Or is it everything all together and I just need to suck it up and get a new pc?

I’ve not had any issues with other games up to this one. I’ve found RAM that I can upgrade to for about $75 but if that’s not going make a difference alone then I’d rather not waste the money.

Then I got the Chameleon from the final Bounty mission (whatever the current Boss was called)... Also not a good roll, but hey - I didn't have it before.

fsliad,Ninjaruski,"Congrats, Massive, on the Purgatory that is the Pentagon.","So, casual player here again. I’m here to talk about the purgatory that is the Pentagon and it’s lord “Mega.” This is a masterpiece of suck a d fail whose equal I have yet to discover. Truly, Massive should be commended. 

Why should they be commended? Well, we’re all aware of the bullet spongeyness of elites, their absurd damage, and their ability to map you with a shotgun. In this map, they’ve managed to surpass that. 

I’m talking about a mission that forces you to deal with all of that in a room with limited cover and no shields. Where a named chungus marches around the room and hoses you with fire. 

I’m taking about his asshole medic friend who heals or revives his buddies if you’re lucky enough to put one down. Did I mention he throws grenades with unerring accuracy?

I’m talking about his grenadier buddy who just keeps lobbing grenades at you, rendering your cover useless. And should you shoot him while he’s charging up? Well, that doesn’t fucking matter. 

What about skills, you ask? What skills? The room is covered in EMP pulses. If you’re lucky enough to disable two of them, a third spawns just as a fuck you to your poor agent. Naturally, this assumes you can even down them. 

All of this would’ve been manageable were it not for the fact that my bullets just... vanish. Seriously. I’ll unload a whole magazine into an enemy and maybe hit maybe 75% of the time. 

But let me calm down. So my SHD tech is offline. I still have grenades and my signature weapon, right? Wrong. Part of this hell is watching the chungus and his pals shrug off your riot foam and unload their weapons into your face. 

The other part is watching him wander through your Gatling gun fire like it’s a light rain, a fine lavender scented mist, and shred you with his own Gatling. And then you’re just out of ammo. And probably dead. 

So, thanks Massive. I commend you for the many layers of fuck you that are buried in every new update to this game. You’ve created a masterpiece of frustration rivaled only by Bungie’s boss stomp mechanics.

fsldev,yatyas89,Wall Glitch in division 1 darkzone no one banned then so why now?,"So I haven't seen anyone compare that glitch to this one. For those who don't know there was a wall by a checkpoint that if you rolled towards it then instantly go into cover on that wall you would enter a glitch. Basically your characters body would stay there while on your screen you were able to move around and kill other agents, with them being completely defenseless, because to them you were invisible. That was a game breaking glitch that was around for a couple weeks as well and no one got banned. I used it and so did a lot of the people I played with and crushed everyone in the DZ. So why wasn't anyone banned then that's just as bad as the dps glitch. I didn't use the dps glitch or the revive glitch in this game only because I didn't want to feel like a piss ant when it was patched and going back to doing shit dmg if that makes sense. 
Should they of issued bans for this in my opinion no, because guess what it didn't affect me I just didnt go into DZ and as far as the leaderboards go just wipe them once all the glitches are fixed. I dont think players should be banned for finding a glitch that was a mistake by the developers, if you stayed out of the DZ. Now if you went into the darkzone and used the glitch to smash the lobby then ya you should get banned. Because at that point you are directly affecting other people's playing experience. For those who think that playing in LZ with the glitch affected others experience I can't agree with that because like i said just wipe the leaderboards, and those who posted great run times of they really care about that then they will do it again, but I feel most of the player base just wants to pass the set times fast enough to get the rewards at the end.",3,1585688900,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsldev/wall_glitch_in_division_1_darkzone_no_one_banned/,thedivision,0

fsl6nd,swift4010,"Made a post for my clan, figured I'd throw my hat in the ring and post my opinions on here as well.","My personal take on the whole ""massive ban"" thing:

If you were someone who is legitimately innocent, who got caught in the crossfire, then contact massive. If you just matchmade with someone who did it, and didn't know, then open up a support ticket. The system that handed out these bans is liable to get things wrong, I'm sure it's complicated to try to figure out who did what based on meta data. Create the request, get a human to look at it, and hopefully they can sort it out. And yes, some people didn't get punished that should have, but hopefully this at least discourages people from doing shit like this in the future.

And yes, you can argue that massive shouldn't have let this bug ever happen, but imo that's a bad argument. Yes, they have play testers to find bugs, but it's unreasonable to expect that they'll find all the glitches, especially if it's some convoluted thing like ""get on and off a turret in the open world while swapping weapons while having 10 famas's in your inventory with measured on them, while wearing a pink beanie and yellow sunglasses, at 2 in the afternoon while your teammate does a dance emote..."" you get the point.

When a bug like this gets found, it's on Massive to fix it as soon as possible (which they did). But it's also on the players to play the game according to the rules of conduct set out by Massive. When players hop from one bug to the next, as massive keeps rolling out fixes, in this twisted game of cat and mouse between the players and the devs, they're going to pull out the big guns to shut it down.

And I know some people only did it in pve, but just because you're not killing other players, doesn't mean you aren't competing with other players. There's leaderboards in the game, there's also a clan xp leaderboard for the week, and just because you might not care about them, doesn't mean other people don't care. How frustrating would it be to a non-exploiter to not have any chance at competing for the clan xp, since other members are able to pump through 4 legendaries an hour?

And speaking of legendaries, when TU8 launched, I was super pumped to get into doing legendaries. I wanted to cool outfit, and I wanted a bighorn to show off as a prize. When the damage glitch because mainstream, it 110% killed all my motivation to do legendaries. Getting the rewards at the end meant nothing now, hell it meant less than nothing, since people would just assume I exploited to get it, since 90% of the people with them didn't get them honestly. I heard from a friend ""yeah, my entire clan just got bighorns"", like 2 days after the glitch became a thing.

And let's not forget the non-exotic god rolled gear you get from doing legendaries. I'm a big fan of competing for ""who's got the hardest hitting build? Who does the most damage?"" Hell, there's a whole channel dedicated to that in here. That motivation to compete also got killed when so many others got god rolled everything because they farmed Legendaries in their sleep.

All this to say, even if you don't pvp, using the damage glitch still had negative effects on the people who didn't. In my opinion, both the temporary ban, and the account rollback were necessary courses of action, to get the mentality of ""we can do whatever we want cause massive isn't going to do shit"" mentality out of the communities head, because it's appalling how large of a percentage of the community joined the ""let's cheat because they made the game too hard"" bandwagon, instead of being patient and waiting for the fixes that are coming to make things like legendary missions more feasible. 

**TLDR:** ""My name is Swift, and I approve of this message"" (the ban and rollback). If you're innocent, open up a support request, and hopefully a human will be able to take a look at the records, and set things straight.",7,1585688315,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsl6nd/made_a_post_for_my_clan_figured_id_throw_my_hat/,thedivision,0

This whole fiasco is bigger than just us as individuals now, it centers around the royal US the **players** (hardworking, loyal customers that EARN our own money) versus the **creators and publishers** (devs and Massive). At the end of the day, it's a shit game. We know it. Massive knows it. Devs know it. But we all play it.


Whether you got banned or not, whether you like or dislike the ban, it's happened. All of this discourse is EXACTLY what Massive wants. They want the player base to be fragmented because when we unite, we're way too much for them to handle. Because united, the players all affect their bottom line. When we deflect from the MAIN issue (re: Divsion 2 gameplay, ergonomics, and quality of life *sucks*) Massive gets to quietly take their sweet time working on these ""known issues"" and make a joke out of its customers (us). 


I don't need to list the issues we've seen. There are hundreds upon hundreds of posts on the forums, on this subreddit, in their customer service ticket line. We want them to fix the hive bug? Fix Black/White Tusk doing WAY absurd DPS? Fix Green Gear talents? Fix shit exotics? Fix piss poor RNG rolls? Fix lazy programming and game design? Hate how a cover-based game constantly kicks you out of cover, or doesn't let you use cover because of shitty AI mechanics?


**Stop playing the game.**


We give them so much money because of HOPE. HOPE that they do a better job. HOPE that they fix their game to our liking. HOPE that they fix all the bugs, quickly, professionally, at a high standard of quality. This hope is gone now. There is no more hoping anymore. Now is the time to **do**. Now is the time the player base needs to unite and **demand** our money's worth. I can list off reasons why I still play the game, why you play the game, but at the end of the day, you, me, everyone who plays this game we can all agree on one thing: things can be better, we want better, we deserve better, YOU deserve better. 


If you're the general population, YOU work hard for YOUR money. Undoubtedly. YOU go to work for 8+ hours, YOU put up with bullshit customers, managers, bosses, red tape, bureaucracy, Karen's workplace drama, or even all of the above. Your time is worth money. You are worth money. You have value. Anyone and everyone with a sense of reason or logic can agree to this. You are worth what you decide your time is worth.


At this point, unfortunately, Massive and their devs have unanimously determined that their end content, their higher tiered gameplay, and their overall game, is not worth *their* time, *our* time, or *our* money. Even the devs played the game on ""Normal"" while filming SotG playing polarization and said it was fun, think about that for a second.


So at this point, before you start typing, before you hit that ""Continue"" button on the Division 2 log-in screen, before you do ANYTHING, think about this for a second, ""Is it *worth* my time, emotional, physical, and mental energy to continue participating in my own abuse?"" 


**I'm not asking you to stop playing forever, but stop playing for now.** For if/when they address AND FIX these issues. They want to show us they care? Now is the time to do it. How they respond to all their loyal customers leaving will determine whether they care about you or not. People who constantly say Massive doesn't care or people who sing the opposite? This will let them PROVE IT. banned or unbanned. like or dislike the game. DPS glitched or not. **This game is fucked if we keep fighting with each other**. We need to fight Massive, because THEY'RE the ones who built this game, THEY have the power to change it, THEY have the power to provide us with **Quality Assurance** in every sense of that concept.


Stand with me. We're all customers to them. But we're all gamers to each other. Together we can actually change this game and make it something worth playing. Worth sharing. Worth fighting for. United, we are strong, and they will listen. Fragmented, we only play ourselves. Divided, we only fight ourselves. Segregated, then Massive wins. Continue hoping for a lost cause. You've earned your money, make them earn theirs. 


Let's make a deal devs &amp; Massive. You say you ""read and closely monitor the forums and subreddits"" (literal quote from SotG), then let's make a deal. Your player base will deliver on the promise to stop playing this game for now. We'll come back when you deliver on your promises to fix your game AND provide us with the assurance that it is **quality**. 


Public Service Announcement: because of the pandemic, there are tons of other games out there on sale, for free, not made by Ubisoft of Massive. Go check them out. Hell, go read a book. Get some extra sleep. Hug your loved ones and tell them you love them.

fsktyj,hersheydood,The constant simplification and reduction of RPG elements is hurting this game.,"Massive, why do you keep simplifying EVERYTHING that requires more than 20 IQ points to think about? There is a huge lack of build diversity, interesting gear/brand set effects, exotic weapon/gear functionality, skills and even mods. Everyone is running the same cookie cutter builds because they are the most efficient, but not only that - everything other than these builds is SO MUCH WORSE.

* We had negative stats on mods, people could sacrifice a little here and gain more somewhere else.
 * Negative stats were removed, mods gave tiny, nearly insignificant bonuses.
 * We used to run DTE mods, now everyone runs crit chance mods
     * The best in slot mods are blatantly obvious, we have no reason to use anything else, but we would if some had bigger buffs with downsides.

* Exotics are supposed to be strong, build defining, and almost gamebreaking. 
 * Before WONY, exotics were strong. Some were too strong sure.
 * Getting an exotic felt great, and if the roll was bad you could upgrade it.
 * Now most exotics are useless, they are for fun rather than for progression.
     * Why would I use my garbage rolled Bullet King when my even worse rolled MG5 does SO MUCH MORE DAMAGE?
     * Why would I use Diamondback, Merciless, or even a Nemesis when my M1A can 1 shot reds, and pick off enemies faster and more efficiently?
     * Why would I use a Chatterbox or Eagle Bearer if it can't kill non-reds with 1 mag?

* Holstered talents were not complicated, some were just too strong.
 * 1 talent on a gun is just so incredibly BORING.
 * Exotics had unique, fun holstered talents that synergized well with certain builds.
 * Wascally, in Rythm, Protected Reload were all Fantastic yet simple ways to improve your build
     * The only holstered talent that hurt the game was Merciless, it could have easily been changed.
     * We have no incentive to run exotics, or anything other than MG5 + M1A.

* Brand sets outperform Gear sets, are simpler, and are also less focused.
 * Brand sets are incredibly easy to farm with targeted loot, or even crafting.
 * Massive bonuses on most Brands with just 1 piece equipped.
 * Massive wanted to steer away from 4+ pieces so hard, that almost every gear set has garbage talents.
     * Many of the sets (at least the raid sets) had fun/interesting team buffs, now everything except TP is solo.
 * Gear sets require you to hyperfocus a playstyle.
     * Gear sets have 1 less attribute each, as well as no brand bonuses, yet their effects come nowhere close to that of a full brand set build.
     * THEY DON'T EVEN WORK

* Named items (specifically gear) are must haves.
 * Named items were supposed to be slightly better versions of regular items.
     * Key word: Slightly.
 * When it comes to weapons, they have a unique (read: stronger) talent, which is fine.
 * When it comes to gear, the bonuses are so strong, you MUST use them.
     * And when it comes to gear without talents, they are BEST IN SLOT.
     * If you want to play DPS, if you don't have named gloves and knees, you might as well not play a DPS.
     * I thought massive wanted build diversity?

* Hunting the best skill mods is almost pointless now.
 * Gear mods have enough stats to affect your build, so they're not garbage, but the way they affect it is incredibly boring. 
     * 6 crit chance? If only I didn't already have 6 x 6% crit chance on my armor.
     * 16k armor on kill? I'm a tank, I don't kill stuff, but thanks for less than 1% of my armor back.
 * Skill mods are utter garbage, except for a specific few like Shield health.
     * Skill mods should be the in-between for skill tier 0 and 6.
     * Skill mods should be what makes a tier 0 chem laucher not absolute dogshit.
 * If the only thing that matters to most skills is skill tier, then the base skills need to be better.

* Lack of gear talents probably hurts build diversity the most.
 * Do you know what EVERY SINGLE DPS is running?
     * Glass Cannon (or focus if you're bug abusing but whatever)
 * Do you know why we all run Glass Cannon? Not because its 30% more damage...
     * Because every other talent is AWFUL.
 * Before the update, there were builds, and meta builds, but at least some people made their own and had fun with it.
     * Every single build now is cookie cutter, same talents, same attributes.

* Even the specializations got the simplification ray.
 * Some of you may like the fact that every spec can use ""every"" weapon.
     * Before that happened, people actually committed to a certain playstyle, and it included everything from your build, to your weapons, up to your signature weapon.
 * If a sharpshooter joined your team, you knew he's got a nice sniper build. If a Demo joined, you knew they got a good crit build.
     * Look at what people are using now. Not only is it the same weapons everywhere, its the same specs too.

* While simplified, the game is even less solo friendly.
 * No hybrid builds anymore, so if you want to clear content fast you have to be a dps.
     * As a dps, you die incredibly fast, and you can barely heal yourself.
     * You basically HAVE to run revive hive, and most likely a repair drone.
 * Apparently the lack of surviviability for solo players isn't real, and that's why solo enemies even got a health buff.

***

Long story short: Massive, you keep making the game more and more simple. This is supposed to be an RPG! There is supposed to be choice involved, at least in build making. Everything in this game is so dumbed down that every build is the same. Exotics are boring and weak, gear sets are far worse than brand sets, and 1 weapon in each class outshines the rest by miles. Everyone has and will continue to have the same builds and talents.

There is no choice left for players to make. You get the same cookie cutter build or you perform significantly worse. 

If you just play casually or for fun, and ""performing well"" isn't your goal, then honestly I'm glad for you. I hope you enjoy this game as long as you can.

For many of us more hardcore players, things are going 2 steps back with every change. We were supposed to have our 2nd raid a long time ago, all these bugs are going to add an even bigger delay to it. I really hope that whenever it does come out, it has an exotic and gear sets actually worth using, because otherwise we will need a gear 3.0.",55,1585687213,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsktyj/the_constant_simplification_and_reduction_of_rpg/,thedivision,8

fsklhq,thechilledintrovert,A Civilized Discussion regarding The Current State Of This Game and the Current State of This Community,"Warlords of New York Expansion desperately needed a PTS in order to iron out the bugs, balancing and exploits and perhaps a little more time for a stable launch with less issues. Ever since the launch and today's uproar in the community, this simply makes it look as it was rushed in order to get a quicker cash grab just because yay we finally get to take on Aaron Keener(I won't lie because that is what it convinced me to get the expansion so I pre ordered it as soon as the pre orders went live on Uplay and I really don't regret getting the expansion). I still don't understand:

1. Why wasn't there any closed alpha, closed beta and an open beta for this expansion when it lead to so much issues regarding the npcs, balancing(co-op scaling) etc.
2. Also why weren't some youtubers(not going to name them as we all know it) didn't get banned for showing and using the exploit in order to get some views for their channel instead of just reporting it to the forums. But no they just ended up showing these exploits ""for views"" to simply boost their channel. Also why are they being exempted when they were the ones to actually make the glitches available publicly so that it can be easily reproduced by the ones who are more likely to exploit the game.
3. Also on what basis and how were they able to identify players who used the exploit? If we are talking about the leaderboards, considering by that logic, almost it's more like killing majority of the playerbase and also can't really say they ""specifically"" used the dps glitch to hit quicker time trial completions. Even The Raid Leaderboards are broken and we all know that leaderboards were broken back since The Division 1 due to various other hacks being used like some third party softwares. In the case for The Division 2, maybe there could be third party cheat softwares which Easy Anti-Cheat(EAC) fails to detect it.
4. Regarding the bans, even players who were unaware about such glitches were got banned because they might have joined a session where the host was known to use the exploit.  So how is their fault when all they did was join matchmaking?

IMO Massive should just revert the ban decision and give everyone a last and final warning for trying to use exploits. As for those players who used this exploit in The DZ that should continue to be remained banned. Also please Massive will you please consider doing a PTS for any of the upcoming title updates in order to prevent such chaos and a divided community again?

Also thanks for taking your time to read this. I hope things get back to normal and we as the community can try to enjoy the game again.",18,1585686464,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsklhq/a_civilized_discussion_regarding_the_current/,thedivision,11

fskdge,AgentSkankHunter,Seasonal Exotic Unlock,"Hi all, I've read a lot of posts about the state of the game and now it's completely flooded with people complaining about the bans. So this is my attempt to post something outside of this if anyone feels like being a bit constructive. 

Massive could add a vendor or npc at the base that will allow you to choose one exotic per season and progress towards unlocking it (maybe even guaranteed better to God roll stats?). Naturally, it will be a grind fest but given you have months and months per season, normal progression should hopefully get you there (for example, get 5000 kills per faction?). Even locking this npc until finishing seasonal awards is fine with me. 

This helps three groups of players that I'm aware of. Those who have played countless hours and still has an exotic that has evaded them. Those who are looking to God roll and receive a better roll on an exotic (for me, bullet king low rolls every time after about 100 runs of tombs on herioc). Lastly, for those players who just simply play to receive something to work towards after seasonal rewards (that caps at 100). 

Let me what you think, maybe you have a better idea of end game content in terms of quests or post seasonal rewards. Would also like to incorporate a money sink (edit: to clarify, it's in game currency I'm talking about) into the game because there's really nothing useful about it at the moment. Perhaps allowing you to buy materials or legendary caches with a 0.5% chance of an exotic?",3,1585685771,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fskdge/seasonal_exotic_unlock/,thedivision,1

fsjso0,Effortful,Massive Tinfoil Plan,"One possible reason for such a harsh punishment is massive realising their season doesn’t have enough content to last players another couple of months.

Seeing that a good chunk of the player base has either used the glitch or were in the same party as those people, gives massive an opportunity to blindly issue a week long suspension and do a rollback. Now that 2 weeks of progress have been wiped, lots of players would need to regrind all their stuff back. 

Massive hoped for a win-win where they ban exploiters (something that people wanted) and increase playtime for those who experienced a rollback. 

However, they executed it in such a lazy way that it turned into a lose-lose. Blindly banning hosts that had glitchers in their lobby resulted in a heap of innocent people getting suspended while a ton of actual glitchers face no repercussions.

Massive took our focus away from the lack of content in the season to regrinding everything back from the rollback.",15,1585683956,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsjso0/massive_tinfoil_plan/,thedivision,0

fsjjrf,Lunaticwolfdean,Bugs And Issue i Found,"Here is some issue i notice -

1. Enemies can fire with perfect aim when they are on fire. (Tried a burn sticky bomb built where their animation was like they was burning but they were shooting like there is no status effect) (what's the point of fire if they shoot with perfect aim in hipfire and also in cover they shoot perfectly when on fire)

2. If you put enemy on fire and after that put the ensnare status effect,they can still move in your direction or other ignoring the cc which is not intended i think.

3. Before tu8,when npc are blinded they try to locate us and shoot blindly but now when they are blinded,they follow you no matter where you go..sound like a bug

4. Blinder firefly seems to be broken again. When you select target on left and right side,it goes to one direction and after that it self destruct.

5. Fire on heavy seems to do nothing,i think there was some changes like low duration of status effecr on them but they completely ignore burn.(correct me on this if i am wrong)

6. Outcast suicide bomber run silently now,they made noise before tu8 where you can see they are coming...but they can come to you and you don't even get to know that

7. When we are ensnared by npc,we can't move to any direction until its destroyed but when npc got ensnared, they can move upto 180 degree and even fire with perfect aim.

8. If we got a status effect by npc,its duration also get increased by our status effect on gear like wth...this seems to be broken.

9. Why does shock trap shock my teammates when a npc get shocked nearby ?

10. If you have full status effect on your built and you do polarity GE, when you shoot they wrong npc,you got shocked for a longer time because of status effect on your on gear (point no.8). Why should i choose status effect if it's extend a status effect on my agent ?

These are some bug i found. I think other agents have also seen these bugs...

fsjjl1,Jamerz_Gaming,Thank You Massive for Taking Action,[removed],1,1585683153,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsjjl1/thank_you_massive_for_taking_action/,thedivision,0
fsjiv4,Hexlicious,"If you exploited or otherwise used game breaking bugs to your advantage, you got what you deserved, trying to make Massive the wrongdoer isn't gone change that.","I'm honestly shocked at the state of the forum and subreddit right now, I've never had or seen any reasoning to use exploits no matter the state of a game, I would rather just not play the game if I need to go to such lengths in order to enjoy or overcome content in the game, if you're not good enough to do certain things, or not active/willing enough to get specific pieces of gear, maybe you just aren't suppose to have them? Maybe you bought a game that isn't for you?  


What do you get out of completing legendary missions that were meant to be ridiculously difficult in 5 minutes? You get a leaderboard placements and every single legit player is left behind in the dust with their legit placements getting covered because of some shitbucket decided to think about himself before his fellow players, because apparently you feel that you're entitled to whatever the reward you're looking for might be, so you just brush whatever else that might come bite you in the ass under the rug and deal with that later.  


So far playing completely legit I've acquired 5 max rolled exotics, completed every legendary upwards of several times with pretty acceptable times, plenty of max rolled builds that are great and functional in both PVE and PVP content and the list I could write probably goes on, but you get my point, did every mission award me a treasure trove of loot and everything I ever wanted? Obviously not, but this isn't that kind of game.  


Maybe I am just lucky, but that is a part of the game, you cannot honestly believe that you are ENTITLED to a certain item, the game is a looter shooter, it is a MMO, you're suppose to grind, you're suppose to maybe get disappointed when the item you were looking for doesn't drop, it's not suppose to be handed to you on a silver platter, there are people out there with several thousand hours still having a blast grinding for what they need, then there is little Timmy with 50 hours in the game with god rolled gear in every slot because his parents didn't beat him hard enough.  


Do you get my point now? Probably not, but let's continue.  


You're not suppose to complete content you're not good enough to complete, take SolidFPS as a great example, solid player in a solid clan, flying through district union on legendary in 17 minutes with looting included and a few downs, could that be you? Maybe, is it suppose to be you if you cannot do it without exploiting? Fuck no, slide away and go play Heroic, or maybe even Challenging, cause I doubt you can do anything harder if you used this exploit.  


This is what you people do not understand, the game has difficulties for a reason, if you're capable of concurring higher tiers then you'll be rewarded for doing so, if you go out of your way to exploit in order to do the highest difficulty in the game with breeze, what does that make you? A player having fun or a player ruining the fun for others by getting things he was never suppose to have? Massive has had to have focus on this exploit for the last week and a half now instead of fixing other bugs currently in the game, because a bunch of people were dumb enough to make that their focus by abusing an exploit they very easily could have just avoided and not touched.  


If somebody pulled off this crap in let's say World of Warcraft and got the best of the best by exploiting game breaking bugs and trying to brush it off as the developers fault, most avid players would look at them wondering what in the world makes their brain function when they are receiving such little oxygen.  


You got what you deserved, and I truly hope Massive sticks to their words and pulls it again if necessary, exploiters and people ruining the game for others are a pest that should be exterminated.",142,1585683094,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsjiv4/if_you_exploited_or_otherwise_used_game_breaking/,thedivision,0

fsj9r0,Droolguy,Mods need to automatically store your highest rolls and they should be independent of specific armor pieces.,"Mod management in this game is the very definition of tedious and unfun.

Not only do you need to keep track of every stat in the game that is possible to roll, but you have to memorize your top three rolls for every stat and store them.

This leads to a massive headache once you actually have a decent mod collection since there is absolutely no way to sort mods by their actual rolls and you have to literally go one-by-one through all of your mods in a given category if you find something that you ""think"" might be an upgrade over what you already have.

On top of that, mods are bound to a \*specific\* piece of gear that they were added too, why? No reason. Literally no functional reason. They can be removed and transferred, but without going to the specific item that the mod is in the game won't tell you what mod is in which item so transferring ""in use"" mods to other items is a shot in the dark.

The system needs to be fixed...

1. Mods need their own equip category that is static and independent of a specific piece of gear. Switching your chest piece does NOT take the mod with it, gear simply denotes the number of and color of mod slots available. If I have a red chest, red mask, and red backpack, with three red mods equipped and I swap out my chest for a different red chest, nothing happens and my three mods continue doing what they were before. If I swap in a blue chest the mod category should just blink red at me showing that I do not have enough red slots to match my mod loadout, order of precedence left to right so 2 of them continue working.
2. Your top 3 red, blue, and yellow armor mods for every different stat need to be unsellable/dismantle, there is no reason for a player to ever do this.
3. Your top skill mod in every category for every different stat needs to be unsellable/dismantle, there is no reason for a player to ever do this.

To be honest you already have a system in the new recalibration bench that would have worked great for storing mod rolls to be used at will when you needed them (since all mods only roll 1 stat), but instead they are literally the only thing left out while being the one thing the bench truely made sense for.",6,1585682302,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsj9r0/mods_need_to_automatically_store_your_highest/,thedivision,3

fsj0ew,rubenalamina,The Division 2 Weekly Vendor Reset 31/03/2020,"Hi there fellow agents. Here's the latest vendor reset information for The Division 2.

# Notes
---

Maintenance today started earlier than usual and before the vendors reset. It also got extended twice, so that's why the vendors update got delayed. I hope this is not a new maintenance start time going forward.

See you next Tuesday.

# Items on Sale
---

Here's the web page link for all the items available in the game. It will always be the same link. It's my personal website and I don't run any kind of ads.

https://rubenalamina.mx/the-division-weekly-vendor-reset/

I added a resources section with a map with 30+ locations to find the Snitch and a link to the datamined gear attribute sheet.

# Cassie
---

Cassie is a gunrunner vendor that moves location every couple of days. To find her, you need to talk to Jared ""The Snitch"" Nash in one of the locations I have listed on my map. His location is random but it usually takes 2 or 3 location visits for him to spawn. After you talk to him, he will give you a bounty and Cassie will appear on your map with a shopping cart icon. You can do the bounty or save it for later, it's not necessary to browse Cassie's inventory.

She will open for 24 hours and will close to relocate for 32 hours. These are her open times:

* **Sunday 8:00 PM EDT**
* **Wednesday 4:00 AM EDT**
* **Friday 12:00 PM EDT**

# Resources

## Weapon Damage Calculator

I made a calculator to use it on my own and for the vendors. It can calculate the damage percentile of any weapon so you know if a roll is good or bad. To use it, just make a copy and input your weapon damage values from the character sheet in the first section or just the base damage value shown in game after enabling it in the weapons section of your inventory. The sheet has a short link in the instructions so you can share it or bookmark it more easily. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JRP7nhNVIs37ZquApIhKdjbM0QGv-R8EvjwC6aF7j8o/

## Timers Website

A couple of members of The Division Community Discord made a site that shows all the in game timers in your local time zone. It also has the open and close timers for Cassie so you can use it to check if she's open or not before you go find the snitch. The site can be accessed here: https://divisiontimers.com

## Wiki Page

The link for the current weekly thread and the vendor items list is always available in the [Vendor Reset Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/communityresources/vendors) in the community resources. You can find it in the top navigation menu of the subreddit. If you're on mobile, it will be on the sidebar.

# The Division 1 Reset
---

Some of the guys and girls in the vendors team are trying to keep The Division 1 vendor resets alive. The sheet will be automatically updated when they are done, even if they haven't posted their weekly thread. I will add an edit with the link to their weekly thread when they are ready. These reset happen on Friday nights at 7pm EST.

fsizw4,sykoseiki,I wish there was some sort of checks and balances for the developers,"Preemptive apology as this is my first long winded post, so forgive the format and such.  Also, ""checks and balances"" might not be the correct terminology, so forgive that, too.

Mostly all of us charged into the new DLC with high hopes that this game will finally be what it was meant to be from the beginning.  The story was meh-ish (I liked the ending, but everything else was a slog), the only good things from Gear 2.0 was the stat library, and the game is now so full of bugs that people are getting banned for exploiting them.  I wish there was some way to partially throw a ""ban hammer"" to Massive for releasing a product that is in such bad shape.

There was no PTS or ETF to test out the new content, which allowed for so many issues to crop up.  I have no idea why they could not have forgone any story additions to a PTS as to not spoil new content, but they must have their reasons.  Bugs detrimental to player activities far exceed those that benefit, and yet players get punished.  I have no idea why these player hurting bugs cannot be fixed as quickly as the beneficial ones, but, they must have their reasons.

I, myself, purposely exploited the bugs for all that it was worth.  My mentality being that I will take whatever advantage I can get until this broken game that I love gets fixed.  I was so stoked to play Striker again, but the talents were broken; I was so eager to farm targeted loot from CP4s, but those are broken; and many more instances.  I will admit that I had an absolute blast seeing enemies on the receiving end of a one-shot, stray bullet blind fired from cover.  I had fun, yet I get punished.  This bug-ridden game played normally is not very fun at the moment.

You step in fire or poison, you have no time to adjust before your death.  I have to shoot my own teammates to build Striker stacks, which then immediately disappear when I miss a shot.  I farm for hours and days on end to get a Bullet King with less than 25% stats, or I finally get a pair of BTSU gloves with 0% rolls.  I have to resort to farming target practices in targeted loot areas because my CPs do not reset.  There are so SO many more issues that people are complaining about, yet the damage exploit gets addressed immediately?  How is it that there have been so many issues that are still present since the beginning of the DLC launch, and yet the damage exploit gets fixed immediately and people are punished?

The developers can take their sweet time to fix a single issue that hurts the players, and there's nothing you or I can do about it.  It's not fun to play with all these bugs, and when there is a bug that is enjoyable to use, you get banned.  There's no checks and balances when it comes to the developers.  They release such a huge expansion in such a sorry state, and we as the players are punished for it.

I wish there was an equal action that could be taken against the company for releasing the expansion in such a shitty state.  If the expansion was bug-free, enjoyable, rewarding, and fun, then by all means, set the ban hammer free on those who exploit it.  But to take action against players for abusing an exploit and not fixing any of the bugs that are actually hurting the players just isn't fair.  I didn't sign up to beta test the expansion when I purchased it.  I expected to be jonesing hard during maintenance or being torn about dividing my time between Div2 and others games I enjoy.  I have since put the game down until it's fixed, or I can finally play what I expected to be playing since launch.

If you got this far, thank you for your time.  I'm not sure where this mentality sits with the rest of you, but I got pretty sick when I heard about the bans.  I really do love this game, but to punish the players when none of the other bugs have been fixed is pretty messed up.",11,1585681452,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsizw4/i_wish_there_was_some_sort_of_checks_and_balances/,thedivision,0

fsimyg,ArcaneLG,Let's Talk About Exotic Acquisition (and Bighorn in particular),"Before I get started, I'm going to explain the difference between grinding the raid and legendary strongholds. If you've experienced both or just don't want to read this, feel free to skip. What the fuck is a legendary stronghold for? You get some arguably cool cosmetics and some loot with good rolls that can be found outside those strongholds. The problem is that it goes against what Massive said TU8 was supposed to be.  ""No more bullet sponges"" my ass. Everything I've heard about these activities is negative, even from the best and most experienced players. Each encounter takes ages, and there's only one checkpoint right before the last encounter, so if you die you've just lost quite a bit of progress. This is even worse than the raid, which is at least a change of pace from regular missions and open world and tests skills other than ""can you stop the enemy from casually strolling to your position and devouring your asshole?"" Legendary cranks up the stats on some Black Tusk enemies, which happen to be the most cancerous one to fight because of their gadgets, to make the game harder with no attention to the player's experience whatsoever.  

Right out the gate, I'll say this: I don't have Bighorn. I'm not even a great Division 2 player honestly, and I started around 2 months ago. However, I have played other looter shooters like Destiny 2 and I've noticed a bit of a trend throughout all of them. Every game has their fancy items that are super rare or require a quest to obtain, but some handle acquisition of these items better than others. I actually think Division 2's exotic questlines are fine. The Nemesis quest is a great example: a quest that isn't terribly long (if we don't include time gating), doesn't require arbitrary objectives to grind (i.e. kill 100 Black Tusk soldiers with headshots from Marksman Rifles) and also has a bit of lore mixed in that lets you solve the mystery of where these parts are. Even if you looked it up online like most people, myself included, you might have noticed that the names specified in the first component you got matched the bosses of invaded strongholds. Read a bit more, and you'll realize that these stronghold bosses were actually told to look for the Nemesis components and that's why they're carrying them! It's the nice little details like this one that help keep a player interested and encouraged to pursue other exotics. Now, since we all have access to the internet, players will probably know what the exotic they're chasing actually does if they've looked at a guide. That's understandable, and the developers should absolutely take this into account during the development process. That doesn't mean don't make any puzzles, since plenty of people probably still enjoyed the mysterious hunters even if they had to look them up. However, that does mean that if the exotic the questline leads to is absolute shit, very few people will want to chase it, and completionists like myself will only do so reluctantly. Now, if Nemesis was shit, people would probably still end up getting through natural progression from doing invaded missions, as long as they got that first component (which isn't hard at all). But what if the quest was replaced with an incredibly time-consuming activity that requires a coordinated team, has disappointing loot, and doesn't guarantee a drop? Sounds like Eagle Bearer, doesn't it? Well, there's another weapon \*cough\* \*cough\* I'll be getting to later. People were willing to wade through a shitstorm if it meant getting an amazing AR with unique perks. Then, it got nerfed, and now newer players like myself are advised to stay away from the raid. My point is that Eagle Bearer was worth pursuing when it was really powerful, and it was excellent incentive for people to learn the specific mechanics of the raid (especially because there isn't any other raid-exclusive loot). The RNG of the drop is still unfair, but at least when it finally happened you couldn't wait to equip it and start mowing down some dudes. Now, I'm going to talk about Destiny 2 for a bit. All of Destiny 2's raids featured raid-exclusive loot outside of exotics. There were exclusive weapons, armor, and even mods that could only be equipped on that exclusive gear. Now, that was all Year 1 and there weren't any raid-exclusive exotics, but that changed with the Last Wish raid and random perk rolls in Year 2. There were still exclusive raid weapons and armor, but now they had random rolls (not random stats like Division just random perks) which made replaying the raid more worthwhile. In addition, the absolutely batshit insane exotic fusion rifle, One Thousand Voices, became a potential drop at the end of the raid. Similar to the Eagle Bearer, this weapon was pure RNG; I got it on my third try, so I was insanely lucky, but some of my friends gave up after over 100 attempts. The simple fix to this is to add ""shards"" or something that were guaranteed to drop that you could trade in for the exotic. What if Eagle Bearer shards dropped after each raid encounter, and if you did the raid 20 times and still never got a drop, you'd have enough shards to trade for one. Cassie Mendoza already provides a couple named items, so an exotic every once in a while wouldn't be too crazy. They could even be poorly rolled so you're still encouraged to grind the raid for a better roll. Now, let's discuss an example of every downside I mentioned combined: Bighorn. Legendary strongholds, like I stated above, are far worse than the raid. Rewards are underwhelming for the time invested, enemies are just unfair, and almost no checkpoints. But you'll have to do these if you want Bighorn. It's not even a guarantee that you'll ever get this weapon, and even if you're committed that 5% droprate really doesn't help. And what's your reward? A mediocre assault rifle that also has a rifle mode I guess. Considering ARs aren't in a great spot right now and we already have excellent rifles like Baker's Dozen, there really is no reason to use this gun. I initially thought the gun would retain its fire rate when scoped in, which would push its damage through the roof but also make it hard to control. In that case, you'd use it for midrange encounters as an AR, and if something got too close you would tear it apart. Unfortunately, that's not the case, and we're left with a piece of shit exotic reliant on RNG in an activity that nobody enjoys.

fshvj3,moonski,Massives design philosphy is genuinely antifun.,"It's the only explanation.

Massive I want to play this game. I really want to. I really like(d) the divison 2.

But now it's a unrewarding unejoyable mess of a loot shooter.

The entire gameplay loop is just bad now. There's no redeeming quality found in any part of it that makes the game somewhat enjoyable moment to moment.

* Are grenades worth using? no
* Do strategy, tactics, postioning affect fights? no
* Do enemies react to you in fight? no they bum rush
* Is it fun hiding in cover all fight scrambling to heal? no
* is it fun having to run healing skills only? no
* Are the other skills even useful anymore? no.  (I could make skills somewhat useful, true, but then my guns stop working)
* can you at least melt enemies solo? not anymore
* So is the entire combat loop actually fun anymore? no...

So you endure this mundane, aggrevating at times combat loop, at least the loot at the end should make it worth it? Oh its bad too?oh ok...,

Well what about the overall picture, the reason you run this loop over and over? Build diversity/end game content / something to work towards? That doesn't exist either, oh ok...

Which part of this loop, this game even, is meant to be enjoyable given massives design choices since TU8? They've butchered every part of what made TU7 engaging and enjoyable. I could happily sit down in tu7 and run whatver, the loot was shit but there was a lot of it.

But the loot being shit didnt matter becuase the combat was *really* fun. And there were god knows how many build combinations to work towards... the game had huge problems pre TU8 (inventory mangement hello), but we put up with them because the core loop, the ""combat puzzle,"" was actually enjoyable.

Now they have smashed that enjoyable loop into a billion pieces.  Their concurrent player count must be dropping like a stone, there's no way they are retaining their base with the game as it is now.

Which part of the game is massive sitting play testing (lol as if) thinking, ""yeah we know these other parts of the game have issues, but this part we're tuning feels really good now."" Which part?

Actually, maybe Massive do play test, but they play test as the NPCs and havent realised the players play as agents? Cause let me tell you playing as a cleaner heavy or black tusk drone operator right now would be awesome.",14,1585677992,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fshvj3/massives_design_philosphy_is_genuinely_antifun/,thedivision,3

fsh9y5,InsaneXynN_YT,Massive is a literal joke......,"Following the ban of many players who have used the glitch I was apart of the few. Now that I've gotten that out of the way I want to say how Massive is on a thin line. Did they really think that banning almost the whole community (and somehow for people who did didn't get banned) for 7 days for using a glitch that we wouldn't be using if the enemies in this game were balanced and that bigger YouTubers not getting a ban was a good idea? I admit, I used the glitch for personal gain in PvE. I never ran a legendary with the damage glitch, only used it for farming missions for exotics which I can't get effectively when the missions take 4 hours to complete with randoms and by myself even longer. The big thing that a small amount of people did was use it in pvp and my question to you is why? Why use a damage glitch in PvP when you could already do crazy damage with a build optimized? The damage glitch was the most fun thing I have evef used in this game since it felt like pre TU8 before they added unkillable enemies and red bars who killed you in 2 shots. Massive decides to ban players on a already buggy game that I've liked since Day 1 of The Division 1. I just can't understand why people are calling for Bans for problems they can't solve while we still have the revive hive that has been buggy since launch of WONY. I'm done with supporting this joke of a game called Division 2 and will be playing other titles. I'm expecting the same old ""you should've never used the glitch kid, even if it was only in PvE because it gave you a advantage against other players in terms of gear and weapons"" types of comments but I don't care.

I'm starting to chase specific drops, contractors gloves and fox pads seem impossible to find, but I'm taking massive amounts of time to sort, mull over my inventory. It seriously kills the flow of the game right now, although it's getting better as I start to max values on the table. It's obvious that a near max'ed attribute distribution with damage stats on pretty much any gear is worth keeping, and I have a decent sense of what talents are good, but I'm still learning stuff. Hell, I'm still learning about some of the games basic features and systems. I had no clue that specializations had challenges to unlock items. My current fear with respect to looting is that I'll destroy something that could be really good for other builds. Lastly, is it worth exploring the Darkzone right now? I'm no stranger to darkzone, I put about 200 hours into early Division 1, mostly DZ. If I play the normalized sections, will I fare better there than in an area with veteran players who are all probably min maxed?

fsgssm,DivisionAgent111,"Cruel, Unjust, and Unthought - The “Massive” Ban","Hi all,

I, like many of us, have been recently banned from The Division 2. While I know there is controversy behind the issue, I am looking for a healthy discussion on how this was implemented and whether or not it was too extreme. This is the message I sent Ubisoft this morning to appeal the ban:

I have recently been temporarily banned from Division 2. I am unsure of the exact reason for this temporary ban but after seeing videos recently uploaded by content creators on YouTube, it appears to be due a damage exploit that was allowed to be utilized in-game. As someone who has spent over thousands of dollars/hours on Division and Division 2 (I have purchased the game several times on both Xbox and PlayStation for myself and others to help support this community) I find this temporary ban, in addition to the rollback that will be taking away gear and our time prior to the onset of this exploit, to be cruel, unjust, and without much thought. To this, there are other players who are still playing the game on their account despite the fact that they also performed this same damage exploit suggesting that this action is not universal to all players who have incorporated it in their game; thus, going against any validity of the ban to those who received it. Additionally, the majority of these players, including myself, did this without malicious intent and unbeknownst that it was considered a “glitch” due to highly impressionable content creators posting videos about a simple “damage exploit”. The majority of us did not understand this action was considered something Massive/Ubisoft refers to as a “glitch” and, therefore, should not be penalized with such excruciatingly harsh punishments. If this is not reversed or at the very least reduced to some extent - specifically the rollbacks - then I am requesting a refund for my Warlord of New York expansion pass as well as all of the content, including legacy caches, that I have purchased in that time.

fsgiil,wildchomo,Confession of a cheater,"With everything going on, I felt like this was a good time to share stuff with the community. 

Hey agents! First off, let me say that ONE of my PS4 accounts has been banned. I’m not bothered by it and I’ll explain why.

I currently have multiple accounts on different platforms. Through all of my accounts (5), I am guilty of using some sort of third party cheat, glitch, script or “unfair advantage”. Out of the all my accounts, only 1 has been banned by this morning’s mass ban. 

I’m not ashamed and don’t care much what people think. I’ve been using scripts, glitches, third party cheats in certain games since i’ve laid my hands on a video game controller, and this is one of the few times an account of mine has been banned. 

The reason why I’ve been using these in The Division? I’ve always loved the setting of the games (1 &amp; 2) but I always felt like the gameplay and odds were stacked against us in a predatory way. 

Now to get back to the topic, this mass ban is not only hypocritical but it’s also disingenuous. The DPS glitch has NEVER truly been patched, it still works. It was here BEFORE WoNY and I suspect it will continue to be here. I am still able to replicate it (obviously it now has different steps and such) and I will keep using it.

I personally find pleasure in finding these type of things in video games, I try my best not to let it affect people. Never used it in PVP since I hate it and never would if I did enjoy it. Many of my friends, including my wife benefited from it and will continue benefiting from it, through me. None of them have been banned. When I find a work-around a patch, I tend to keep it in my inner circle. It’s difficult to keep information tight and I believe Youtubers were the reason that blew this out of proportion. 

Now I admit I’ve used things far worse than the DPS glitch and have yet to receive any punishment. I doubt I will because Massive is too busy “pretending” and too focused on blanket covering their mistakes. 

The “plan” WORKED. While a lot of people are banned for something seriously harmless and the game is seriously broken and weakened, the rest of you guys are too busy fighting and rubbing it in each other’s faces. 

There’s A LOT more cheaters like myself out there. They’re just quiet about it. Instead of witch hunting you guys should be focusing your energy on Massive and their inability to fix their game. I am 100% behind banning those who used the glitch in a PVP environment but the rest of the people affected by this mass ban and rollback are a waste of time. 

If Massive truly did spend time combing through the players to catch the cheaters, then they didn’t spend that VALUABLE TIME on fixing the current mess that is the game. I truly believe they didn’t, the bans are too erratic. Some cheaters didn’t receive punishment and some innocent people received punishment. 

Rejoice all you want but they didn’t do anything of value here. They might’ve taken down the small guys but the real ones like myself are still out there. 

Cheers agents, enjoy your game.",47,1585673696,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsgiil/confession_of_a_cheater/,thedivision,3

fsgfq2,Alb4tr0s,My reasoning behind using the DPS bug.,"Good morning y'all. Wall of text incoming. TLDR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont need your simpathy or pitty. Just to explain myself as to why I did what I did. And Im writting down gripes I've got since launch that has topped out at the gear rework vs. npc's scalling.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As of today the game is punishing as hell, not rewarding at all in terms of difficulty. If there was something done right, was the way they handled difficulty after the disastrous 1.3 patch in TD1. Npc's properly scaled and mediocre loot drops at best. It was manageable.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The Division 2 gripe wall.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This game felt like 1.3 since launch. Shame. They fucked up the difficulty from the get go, and made me not want to play, took a hiatus untill the patch that fixed it. Returned after that and I felt way better, enjoyable experience. Activities not rewarding at all, since launch remained the same. Get shit loot every single run. Nothing made it better. My mats pouches were full and the crafting system has been and will always be trash since launch because they dont want to reward the player that farms like crazy and crafts improved gear/guns. Every replica you craft is shit. Pure shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Raid exclusive rewards, this one pissed me off beyond meassure, for those that dont have 7 friends or aren't part of a clan are fucked. Come on man, make all the gears and exotics free to drop in the entire game and not locked behind to certain activities. Thats just moronic. Punishing a big portion of the playerbase by not letting them get all rewards because you want the playerbase to play the raid non stop for the chance to grab the keys and open a chest that has already another layer of RNG for loot and by itself loot already has antoher rng layer of damage rolls on top. RNG over RNG over RNG mechanic.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst daily detail that bothered me was and is getting purples at wt5/end game/legenday content and the worst is getting them to roll higher with lower gear score guns than top gear score guns. Thats just shitty rng by design. Can't it be scalled properly so at least I feel my time is not wasted entirely?

&amp;#x200B;

They made the group scalling so bad that only youtubers and streamers could finish endgame activities and legendary content. Just bad npc design and bad mechanics in terms of how the npcs move.

&amp;#x200B;

The gear rework IMHO is trash. Made it so punishing to fit roles in a group now that whenever something is slightly off, the wipe is inminet in higher difficulties.(this is directly tied to group scalling and difficulty). One taps and wipes werent a concern before WONY and the gear rework. Wipes happened more often when the players did stupid maneuvers and/or have the lack of group cohesion to understand whats going on infront of them, which is common in MM missions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

(this is a matter of opinion entirely, I was used to the pvp of TD1) PVP in TD2 was and is disastrous. TTK is smaller than a pin of a needle, and I personally didnt like the 3 small DZ's design.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've been holding a grudge over the last year in this game because of how the game design turned out to be. Everything that has pilled up about the game and made me rage quit countless times, and get angry when I feel like a I'm supposed enjoy myself. Just ruin the small amount of time I had left during the weekends or during the week if there was any to enjoy myself playing games and have all those hours spoiled by bugs, bad mechanics, unrewarding gameplay. You know what, FUCK off. I will sit on that turret bug and oblitarate enemy NPC's over and over and over and over again Untill I can feel I got my time's worth of the shit me and most of the player base has gone through in the last year.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After some time I understood why MarcoStyle bailed out and didnt want nothing to do with this game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  The past year has been rough for me. I dont mind being banned because I wanted to enjoy myself and what it is to be a really really broken game. I really hope they fix the game and make it work. But i'm not going to be here this time around.

fsg3o0,Malsyon,"Didn’t glitch, didn’t get banned, but even I think this punishment is too severe","If you used this glitch for PvP purposes then you absolutely deserve it.

But a ton of you probably only used it to make an otherwise broken PvE more palatable and I get it. I don’t want to use exploits but don’t blame you if you did. The ban sucks but it’s only temporary, but what gets me livid just thinking about it is that blanket rollback. 

So if you used the glitch for a couple missions and never again, then that rollback also includes days where you legitimately got good loot? Jesus Christ that sounds 50 Shades of Fucked Up. That is such hilariously ass-backwards logic and it now makes me afraid to actually play the game if they can just retroactively nullify progress (and the fact that they’ve been doing this for season pass progress even by accident means it absolutely can happen). I managed to get a god roll Coyote’s Mask about a couple days before this glitch exploded in popularity and imagining it gone unjustifiably because I would use an exploit after the fact is straight up bullshit.

I don’t know how any rational person can defend this unless you got your loot abusing the glitch to steal loot from other players.

fsfse2,Ravenousfire,MASSIVE vs THE DIVISION 2 Player Base,"So it seems that a lot of people were glitching and now bans are rolling.

Some things I generally notice.

Massive releases broken or badly implemented patches constantly.

1. We know this from Division 1.
2. Just because Massive releases broken content does not give you license to exploit the game.
3. Exploiting only hurts the process of fixing the game and creating balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Massive.  Fix your game.  You said that you learned lessons from Division 1.  I don't see it.  The loot is mostly garbage...the rng is terrible.  Why did you not implement systems like Division 1 has?  People were singing the praises of the end of that game...you would have been heroes.  After everything we went through in Div 1, now to see the same mistakes being made in Div 2, is not disheartening, it's infuriating.  People PAY YOU for this game.  You took their money and they are rightfully pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

Exploiters (People who knowingly and repeatedly exploited known glitches).  Stop.  The Legit player base isn't taking your side and defending you just because Massive screwed up their end.  If you have a legitimate gripe against Massive for any number of reasons, you can put it bug reports, put up videos showing the problems and show that game breaking issues exist, and not continually exploit the system for gain just because you can.

If you want to walk away and not return, good, fine, never give Massive another cent.  But don't bounce onto Reddit when you get banned for exploiting and expect us to back you up.  At least for me, the old adage, ""Two wrongs don't make a right"" still applies.

&amp;#x200B;

To the Legit players out there.

Is anyone Surprised by this?  We saw this same situation over and over in Division 1.

How do we get Massive to understand our legitimate gripes about the game?  Do these guys even care what we think about the Division 2 play experience?  If they don't care how we feel, should we keep supporting this game?

fsfg28,Shockifier,Sub-reddit Civil War,"Clearly the community is deeply divided about the ban wave that just happened, and like with all things that people disagree on people are at each other’s throats. 

On the one side we have those that think that using the damage glitch or any other exploit is worthy of a ban no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I think these people should try to see the nuance here, but maybe that’s just me.

On the other side we have those that believe that if Massive didn’t release the expansion with as many issues as it has, people wouldn’t have a reason to use an exploit and, better yet, there wouldn’t BE any exploits. I tend to agree with this particular point, as Massive has a nasty habit of putting off fixing things that negatively effect the player, but hot fixing things that make the game easier.

I see both side’s points, as technically the glitch is against the rules, but people are going to do what they have to do to get past the countless issues currently plaguing the game. I will concede that anybody that used the glitch in PvP to directly ruin the experience of other players is deserving of punishment, I stand firm on that opinion.

fsfcgy,Vikeman45,TU8.4 Enemy NPC Health Values,"This is an update and expansion to [the original post from a few weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fd68dw/tu8_wt5_npc_health_armor_values/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

* [TU8.4 Level 40 NPC Health and Scaling](https://imgur.com/CUbcQBt) (wasn't at level 40 yet so no TU8.0 values for reference)

* [TU8.4 WT5 NPC Health and Scaling](https://imgur.com/dd7pX5R) (TU8.0 values for [reference](https://imgur.com/wnUHdTz).)

I collected this data in the White House firing range for all mission difficulty levels and NPC veterancy levels with as many group sizes as I could pull together (still need 4-man Level 40 and all groups at WT5).  If you want to recreate/validate this data, just use the DPS lane and add up the damage last shot values for each hit. Although the DPS readout in that lane has never been accurate, the damage for each bullet is correct.

Some general background info on enemy health:

* All NPCs at a given difficulty level have the *same* health as a red bar. The veterans, elites and named enemies just stack varying amounts of armor on top of that base health. The table values are total damage - both health *and* armor. To find just the armor value, subtract the red bar amount.

* The amount of armor (percentage-wise) that protects the NPC's health is the same regardless of the difficulty level or group size.

* For a little perspective, a fully-optimized, full-red Classic M1A build takes 17.34 bullets to kill a normal-level Named Elite in WT5. The equivalent Level 40 maxed build takes 17.18 Classic M1A bullets to kill a normal-level Named Elite. Both cases were calculated assuming all non-crit body shots with no other talents proced (worst-case damage output). In other words, the ratio of NPC power to potential player power is about the same between WT5 and Level 40 (likely the same throughout the entire leveling process). That power parity holds true regardless of the weapon you choose.

* The group scaling factor is the same for all difficulty levels, but varies by enemy veterancy. All of the damage numbers shown in the tables are for solo play. To find the group scaled number, multiply the table value by the scaling factor. For example a Named Heroic Elite for a level 40 group of 3 would be 19789226 \* 1.954 = 38,673,805! Holy bullets Batman!

This data is useful for answering questions like:

* How hard do my seekers need to hit to take out a red bar mob?

* How much harder is Challenging than Normal difficulty?

* Is it actually harder to play a mission solo or in a group? (you would have to factor in wave composition differences too)

* What is my time to kill for a Hard Veteran?

* How many enemies can I kill with one magazine?

Edit: added bullet on group scaling

2nd Edit: swapped the order of the table bullets so the graphic that shows (at least on mobile) is the Level 40 table",30,1585669948,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsfcgy/tu84_enemy_npc_health_values/,thedivision,14

#Game Development and Ethics
---------------------------------------------------


Imagine for a moment that you are a game developer. It isn't easy living, it doesn't pay well but it puts food on the table and keeps the lights on, and you want to put out a game people will enjoy. That's the dream, for the most part. But let's say you, like any coder worth their salt will admit, are prone to making mistakes in coding or causing unintentional glitches. It happens to everyone in every industry, including gaming right? No big deal. 


But then imagine instead of being an ethical individual who can stand by their work, good or bad, you instead choose to pass the blame. And not to Charles on the 3rd floor who assisted you on that mechanic you were tasked with creating. No, you pass the blame off onto the customer. ""They just aren't using my product correctly, the poor fools!"" If you did this, then you would be called Massive Entertainment.


Listen, I am not here to justify myself using the DPS glitch or anyone else abusing it. I knew what I was doing, I'm not stupid. However, what isn't right about this situation, perhaps more unethical than the use of the glitch, are two things:


1) Massive released an unfinished product, lied about the state of it, and act like that is an alright thing.


And


2) Banned players and rolled back accounts using a script that is flagging innocent players as well as ""not so innocent"" players instead of taking credit for the glitch themselves.


#Point 1
---------------------------------------------------


On point 1, everyone here is aware how out of balance WONY and TU8 was/still is. The level cap being only available to people who bought DLC was a great way to say to everyone else, ""Sorry, but here at Massive Entertainment, we don't value the time you put in prior to us making [NEW THING]. Buy [NEW THING] to continue playing the game with everyone else or you'll be unable to play the game as it was originally intended because you lack [NEW THING]."" Then, people had their season pass reset. (I was included in this btw.) Good work Massive, thank you for not valuing my time. Especially since these events are all timed for a week or maybe two and your average turn around for proper fixes in the pass are known for being months long. GG NO RE Indeed. Nothing screams ""I don't respect my playerbase or consumer"" quite like not respecting their time spent. All your builds were fucked, all the gear was scrapped, and your exotics were dismantled. No amount of 5 seconds reduced from a 40 second cooldown on some god-forsaken holster is going to make it worthwhile if its talent is pure shit. Just saying. 


The sheer disrespect for the player's time is crazy. Enemies take forever to kill on anything above challenging, only 2 builds really exist at the moment but drops are crazy bad, so it takes more time to grind out better gear. Time investment is through the roof and it kills it for people when a simple sit down session once or twice a week results in nothing gained. Then we get to point 2...


#Point 2
---------------------------------------------------


On point 2, you revert back people's account. Usually, in the industry, this is reserved for one kind of incident only. A major fuckup by the developer in handling people's account information server-side, usually an accidental deletion of account info or a massive fuck up on an update. That is usually the only acceptable time to roll-back accounts as well. But instead, here we have Massive. There is no accountability from Massive on the glitch being their fault in the first place. Instead, let a script decide who lives and who dies. Step right up ladies and gents and roll the dice! See if you get banned and reverted 2 weeks or not! Legitimate progress made? Who cares! At Massive Entertainment, its not our problem that players find the broken shit we left behind! Its their fault for using it, not our fault for not properly performing Quality Assurance. Not once was the thought about the player's time ever brought up. Not once did they think that doing this will cause people to lose two weeks of progress, painstaking progress at that considering the slog that is the current game pacing.


#The Systemic Issue
---------------------------------------------------


And I think that's the moral of the story here and the crux of my issue with the developers. There is nobody taking blame for the issue. There is nobody standing up and saying, ""yup, that's our bad. We will fix it as soon as possible. Its our fault, not yours."" No apology for the fuck up or disappointment despite the overdone hype. No learning from past mistakes and hiring proper Quality Assurance and Testing. Bugs that have been around since launch are still in the game, let alone with WONY bringing bugs back from Division 1! How do you even manage to pull that off? Let me also point out this was a glitch IN-GAME. This isn't something someone did by injecting code or by using a script. This was something so easy to do, some people did it by accident and didn't know. It is NOT the same thing, by any stretch of the imagination, as hacking. 


Listen Massive, let me level with you for a second. Should players have used the DPS glitch? No, they shouldn't have. In a perfect world, they wouldn't have. But we don't live in a perfect world and if we did you wouldn't have released the update in such a buggy, broken, unbalanced state like it was. And instead of doing what's ethically right and taking the blame as you should, you are punishing players for your mistakes. That isn't just unbelievable, its saddening. The glitch exists because you put it there, intentionally or not. Rolling back accounts and throwing around bans and the **THREAT** of permabans does only 1 thing:


**It shields your fragile ego from criticism.**


#The Consequence of Incompetence and Ego
---------------------------------------------------


It is now going to prevent people who find these game breaking glitches from coming forward. And due to that, it will never be officially recognized or noticed. Instead, these glitches will be shared by only a handful of players, and now the integrity of the game's fairness is ruined. Why would I report it if I am now flagged? If I do, there's a chance you may fix it and ban me permanently now. Hell, if you use the same script you use now, there's a chance if I ever log in again and play with any random player in matchmaking I may receive a permaban. So yeah, you won't have a massive amount of people running around abusing a glitch anymore. Cool. Instead, you'll just have glitches that are still abused but in quiet. Now you won't ever really know if you lost that fight legitimately in the DZ to good player or just a glitcher anymore. Because a simple bug report isn't how these kinds of issues are fixed. They are fixed when they get out of hand and ruin Massive's bottom line. When Massive said it ruined the ""game's economy"" and everyone is sitting here questioning what that means considering you can't trade things for money in game, what they really mean is ""it ruined our wallets"". ""It ruined our cash flow because we fucked up. But we can't admit that to you, the player and consumer. Instead, we are going to pull the wool over your eyes and blame you.""



Doing this has ruined any faith I had in the game ever having any integrity. **Primarily because Massive Entertainment LACKS integrity.**


With that, I'm not sure if I can ever return to this game. I loved this game, I loved the premise since The Division 1 was announced. But I refuse to continue to play a game where the development team doesn't step up, take the blame where its due, and then proceeds to wipe people's legit progress. I am miffed my progress is scrubbed, sure. But I'm pissed other people are now screwed out of 2 weeks worth of horrid grind. That's fucked.

fsevnb,PhoenixLegendz,A THANK YOU MESSAGE TO MASSIVE,"Thank you Massive, for freeing me of the biggest let down of my life that I could remember in recent years. I have been a complete Division 1 and Division 2 Junkie for a very long time. Neglecting my health by staying up until all hours of the night grinding for gear that NEVER seemed to drop. Neglecting my work because I would be so tired from those late nights and struggle the rest of the day drinking gallons of coffee just to make it until the next evening and play all over again. I stuck with this broken game while your crackpot team of Game Devs tried to figure out how to fix certain ""Glitches"" and ""Exploits"" in Division 1. Sometimes it felt like I was relying on people that were learning their profession as they stumbled through  fix after fix.  I stuck around and waited for the So called ""Hammer"" aka Ban to drop when Kronos aim devices infected the Dark Zone for MONTHS. Yet, nothing ever happened.  And to be honest, I was glad nothing happened because let's be real, this is a game. It's meant for the enjoyment of playing and engaging with others. It's where a big portion of your player base comes to just relax and have a good time.  We have enough problems in the world right now. I did not want my video game experience to turn into Nazi Germany.  

I know some people will go nuts after reading that. And if that comment offended you, you should be outraged that a video game developer took $60 dollars of your hard earned money for a sub par game at best with broken content and a garbage excuse for ""Farming"" the same crap over and over and over and over and over again.......... Stop the madness !!  If I wanted a game where I had to do the same missions 14 MILLION times I would play a title called ""Groundhog Day"".   Just face the facts, you messed up bad. You were badgered by people that have nothing better to do with their life than play video games and get mad at other people for not playing it with ""Integrity"".  News Flash for those high integrity ""Gamers"" (Which is a joke in it self), the world is being faced with the greatest pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918. We are getting ready to hit 40,000 deaths around the world. People are scared out of their minds and hiding in their homes for weeks.  At a time like this when the world should be coming together you are trying to rip it apart. You missed the greatest opportunity of your life to get a whole new player base into the game I used to love. In today's world of social distancing I would have focused on a campaign to get the millions of people stuck at home on a gaming console playing Division free for the next 30 days.  You might have been lucky and captured 1/3 of those people as regular gamers.  You say your Game Economy was ""Threatened"" by people that used a glitch ?  How will your game economy look now when people leave your garbage title for something else?  Thank you for reading, if you made it all the way to the end.

fsemll,Oreshura,Thoughts after getting banned for the DPS glitch,"Lol I’m gonna go ahead and draw the line here. I’ve played division 1 and 2 from launch, bought the DLC, and played through all of the game up until this point normally. First of all, yes I’ve used the glitch, and no, I don’t regret it, albeit not enough if using it once or being in lobbies with other people using the glitch got me banned. I’ve always believed this game would get better, but I think now it’s time I throw in the towel. 

First off Ubisoft, I hope your reading this. Second. Let me explain what I think is the underlying problems with the game. For one, ya’ll over optimized the NPC’s as this game’s balance is in tatters. How can you be satisfied running a 6 red optimized build just to have it feel like your shooting peanuts (unless ur running the m1a classic) while the NPC’s blind fire one shot you from across the room? Running blue is completely useless as your just a tank with no damage waiting to die, but at least skills feel strong enough (a bit too strong as you’ve made it very difficult to spec into hazard protection/explosive resistance). I went into doing this glitch drawing a line at PVP content as I personally thought it wasn’t hurting the anybody in PVE, I realized checking the leaderboards that may have hurt people that cared about that. But I think your missing the point here, most people, myself included, used the glitch because they felt frustrated with the game as they felt like they did no damage and were constantly getting utterly destroyed in PVE content and some in response to others abusing it in PVP content (real scum of the earth tactics). When you farm for hours on end and u get garbage loot compounded by the one sided difficulty of the the NPC’s, or when you get 1 shot by a glitched vector in the DZ, the game becomes a frustrating chore and tedious to play. 

People, in the end, play games to have fun, and at this point, a good amount of people and myself included, don’t find this game fun anymore. DZ is just rifle meta, even without the glitch, there’s no build diversity, and all the builds I make feel shafted as they’ll never be at a match for NPC’s or other players. I think many you tubers have already said it but when will you listen? On top of that, you nerf everything people find strong instead of examining the weaknesses of the other weapons and there’s no clear progression for better loot. Look at division 1 for example. I loved that game as build diversity was vibrant, you had D3, strikers, nomad, pyro and many other builds I can’t remember off the top of my head. Yes, they were overpowered, but I believe people prefer being overpowered then underpowered, as they actually feel like they have a sense of agency in the game. There was clear progression as you had the optimization station and could make your crappy gear better when obtained from your unforgiving RNG loot system, and with said strong (possibly overpowered) builds, you actually were up to par with NPC’s and other players. 

Lastly, it seems like you’ve toned down the “player skill” portion of the game as it’s now more of a “stat” creep than anything. Again going back to division 1, yes your firearms, skill power and toughness were important, but you designed ways to use player skill to one’s advantage. Prime example, the first aid skill. When in a firefight, even when I had the stat disadvantage, the use of proper timing for the first aid could give me a critical heal, possibly turning the tables on a potential adversary. No, it didn’t always work, but again, it gave the player agency, giving the players more control and freedom to improve and perfect their play. But now, with the advent of slow armor kits and sub par heals (though system corruption is serviceable, but not exactly competitive), the game essentially now boils down to; run as much dmg as possible (with either weapon or skill tier) melt enemy as fast as you can, run away to armor kit, repeat. That or run 4 piece TP and outlive you enemy. These limit the players sense of freedom or agency in how they play the game. Which makes it tedious and not very fun. 

Even before this patch, at one point, I stopped playing PVE content altogether as it was simply a chore and just lived in the DZ as fighting other players was the only way to feel something different and exciting, but even then, it got monotonous with the pre TU8 Armor meta and now the post TU8 rifle meta. Again the game is a unnecessarily long grind to play, and some people like to play like that, I won’t judge them. But I feel as for the majority, when you water down and neglect what players want and need to make the game enjoyable, it’s obvious they‘ll get frustrated and look for their own ways to have fun.

I mean heck, the one or two times I ran the glitch actually made the game fun. IMO, it changed the game from the unforgiving stat creep it currently is to a game of player skill. Yes, you could one or two shot the enemy, but they can just as easily one shot you. I had to actually utilize cover effectively, as being caught out or getting cocky with the DPS enhancement was a death sentence, and other things I can’t name off the top of my head.  If anything I enjoyed the PVE content more as my guns actually felt like guns and made the game “more realistic” rather than shooting cartoon stretch and squish characters. But end of the day, I guess I simply payed for trying to enjoy the PVE content of the game. 

Final thoughts. One, I don’t regret using the glitch as for me, it just highlights one of the key problems with the game. Two, this game at this point has just felt like one long game of cat and mouse between the developers and the players. Three, the game’s a crawling grind as there’s no clear progression system and your at the mercy of RNG. Four, there’s no build diversity as you’ve essentially slowed down the gameplay loop in all aspects with damage, healing, etc. Five, the game is a constant struggle with both PVE and PVP content due to the developers nerfing whatever the community finds strong, watering it down rather than boosting other things up, thus making players even more powerless. Six, all the previous issues compound the current issue of game balancing. And lastly, you’ve now punished players for trying to enjoy the flawed mess that is currently the game at this moment. 

Yes there is a line to be drawn, and there are ethics I think all gamers can follow, but not everyone has a moral compass. There are things I didn’t cover such as the selling of exotics and other shady things this glitch has caused, but I believe every action has a cause, and the abuse of the DPS glitch is just another wake up call to current disarray of the game. Even with the exotic selling issue, people were already doing that before TU8 when the eagle bearer first came out, you can’t really use that as an alibi. 

With all that said and done, I think I’ve ranted enough. Maybe this ban is a blessing in disguise, I can now play other games instead of forcing myself to play a game I use to love stagnate in mediocrity and neglect. 7 days is long time, but hopefully something will change if and when I return. Heck if you want, ban me for longer please, I need a reason to drop the game at this point. I personally don’t know if I’ll return to the game when my ban is over, as I’ve been already demoralized when playing this game in general, but this ban may finally send me over the edge. But hey, what do I know, I’m just one gamer in a sea of other players. 

I know this will change nothing but at least I can get my opinion out there. I’m probably gonna get hate from the “glitchers are scum” camp, and comments from the “Ubisoft sells broken games, your fault for buying it” camp and “your just looking at this game with division 1 nostalgia glasses”. In that case, please discuss and turn it into what ever you want. I want to turn some negativity into positivity. But I hope in the end, everyone will be able to find joy in a game that in my opinion has lost its luster, and will hopefully one day, be a game I want to pick back up. I’m just sick and frustrated with the same nonsense over and over again from this game and it developers at this point. Till then Division 2 and Ubisoft. 

Very respectfully, 
A disgruntled gamer

TL;DR
Got banned for using DPS glitch for PVE content. Wanted to give opinion on state of the game and why people used it. Game has many underlying issues which IMO caused this abuse.

fsei7h,AlexPeaKeaton,Does the punishment fit the crime? You be the judge.,"Just curious what other exploiters are having wiped out vs. what they actually gained.  I got hit with the ban this morning and I'm not going to fight it since I did use it as outlined below.  

Division has always been a secondary game for me, so I'm happy to go back to Warframe, Destiny 2, Diablo, and my other looter favorites while Massive keeps doing their best to destroy their game as they always have.  I for one won't be back to TD2 , and have returned the two digital copies of WONY I bought for friends last week (Thanks Microsoft!).

I might be overreacting, but here's a 100% honest and accurate summary of  my use of the exploit vs. what I lost from legit play.  You be the judge.

Exploit Play - about 5 hours total  
1. Completed the last four time trials levels for Roosevelt Island and Bunker in week 1, but would have received all rewards from doing the event legit in week 2 anyway.  
2.  Did about 15 heroic mission runs, with a poorly rolled Merciless as the only notable reward.  
3.  Cleared about 5 Lv4 CPs, with no rewards of substance to speak of.  
4.  Did about 10 legendary runs with no Bighorn, legendaries, or any decent loot to speak of for me or anyone in my group.

Legit Play - about 70 hours  
1. Farmed countless WW and Hanna pieces for my skill builds.  
2. Farmed about 100 NY open world bosses with no Lady Death (Thanks Massive, this should be punishment enough), and only 2 poorly rolled Pestilence to show for it.  
3. My first Bullet King after about 30+ runs of Wall Street.  
4. My first go-bag after a full day of farming about 50 keys and boxes  
5. 10 of the new hunter masks  
6. A god rolled pair of Contractor Gloves farmed from targeted loot",45,1585667192,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsei7h/does_the_punishment_fit_the_crime_you_be_the_judge/,thedivision,0

I'm so happy that Massive put together this ban and rollback, spent all that time and effort to punish those who unfairly used an exploit in their shotty work, and forgot to make the game work right. 

So ya, apparel event isn't working for me, granted the picture could have been a week old, but you can trust me.

 So, I'm done defending the game.  Get your shit together, and I apologize to the moderators for putting together a hastily made post and being accused of shit-posting.

fse9zc,iWeebo,The Biggest Problem is that Massive got themselves a free ticket to fail,"So with the ban wave we encounter multiple problems.
1. People getting banned by just joining a glitcher's session. With the often poorly matchmaking people are happy to get a lobby and they played it out, perhaps without noticing a glitcher.
2. The Rollback is just too harsh. You just can't take away all of the stuff earned in the last 14 days. Sure there are glitched items in there BUT what about everything else? Eagle Bearers that were obtained legit? SHD Ranks? Apparel Unlocks? Commendations?

But the biggest issue is that Massive now has a excuse to fail. If some glitches occur again nobody will use them because of a ban threat. Therefore they can care less about it. If some sort of DPS Glitch happens again they will just ban people. Easy as that. Essentially they got themselves a free ticket for lazy and poorly executed development. They instead just should've stood up for their mess up without punishing randomly as it seems now. I get that they wanted to show their strength and willingness to punish. But as it stands now nobody will benefit from this mess. Players will leave, Massive has lost even more sympathies and the player base is split up even more.",87,1585666394,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fse9zc/the_biggest_problem_is_that_massive_got/,thedivision,2

fse74j,Sykotic_Assault,Punishing Players for their bad game development,"So Massive decided to ban anyone who used the dps glitch and roll their accounts back..... A glitch that existed due to their incompetence as video game developers. A glitch that was the only thing that made this game fun to play because of how crap the new dlc is. A glitch that even when used, you still spent hours playing the game to farm for crap gear. A glitch that my rifle was doing over 20 mil damage yet NPCs still took at least 3-4 shots to die (imagine trying to kill them without the glitch). A completely harmless glitch that when only used in PVE, people had fun playing your buggy and badly created game.

I understand banning players who abused it on DZ or PVP stuff but players who used it on pure PVE? Really? No one was hurt by this.

Oh and just to make it worse, you reset our accounts back 2 weeks? So all the time spent grinding without the DPS glitch was for nothing? 

Na, I'm good. This definitely goes to prove they don't care about the player base and just how they look. If they cared, they would of balanced and fixed the game way before all of this. They rather ban players for trying to even the odds with their terrible development skills.

Deleted the game, won't be playing Division 2 or any other Massive game from now on.

That was until the game was recently on sale for $3 for PS4, so some friends at work and I picked it up thinking ""for $3 I'll give it a shot."", and I'm glad I did. We had so much fun running the missions, strongholds, expeditions, etc., that we eventually went on to buy the expansion. After going after Keener and his thugs, I thought I would give the Dark Zone a try even though I do not often enjoy PvP. I had always heard that DZ stuff was pretty toxic due to the fact other could kill you for your loot, which did happen a few times. But I also found that there were other players that just wanted to help others get through the DZ without mugging them in an alley after clearing a landmark, or showing up right after they put their loot on the chopper for extraction.

Now coming to the topic of roll back, that is something which is over the top. But the question is, why would devs actually go out of their way and introduce the roll back as a penalty, fully knowing that it could significantly reduce the player base of the game, once the ban is lifted. And the answer is simple. ""Most people have already paid for the Expansion"" . Had the expansion still not been out, I would have liked to see how the devs would have made this decision to strip people of the loot that they genuinely got (of course some of the loot was from the glitch, but a large quantity of the loot was from playing the game and grinding normally).",28,1585665453,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fse0nc/the_real_reason_for_this_ban_and_specifically_the/,thedivision,2

I’m not even sad I got banned. I’ll uninstall the game and find something more fun to play. It’s ok to downvote or upvote or however Reddit responds. I cheated I got banned no big deal.

The overall fact of WHY people cheated though is completely lost on these developers. Same as it was way back in division 1 with the first incursion. Your GAMEPLAY LOOP IS TERRIBLE. YOUR LOOT IS TERRIBLE. Crap rolled gear and a majority of it are mods for doing the same bugged out bullshit over and over again is awful. This game has such promise and potential but it’s squandered by an incompetent development team that has been making the same mistakes over and over and over again. 

Sound glitches out
Skills don’t work or get stuck
Skills aren’t coming back quicker when destroyed
Gear sets don’t work
Enemies continuously become bullet sponges
Event si ignores programming and becomes pretty much self aware
Legendary is a cheese fest 
Enemies get stuck in odd walls or don’t spawn at all
Every activity seems to spawn 14 different other events when it’s supposed to be a tactical cover shooter where you carefully engage enemies 
Matchmaking breaks constantly
Control points still aren’t resetting
Revive hive hasn’t worked in ages 
“Less loot but better” was utter lies. 
Bullet hits don’t register on and off
Connection errors constantly 
Cosmetics drop like crazy and then just stop(not sure if bug or not)

The list is extensive with this company and they CONTINUE to say we’re fixing it, we’re aware of it, later, etc and so on. The go from let the loot rain to let the loot shrivel up but always the loot that does drop has a higher chance of sucking then it does being good.


I always compare this game to diablo3 fairly or not and diablo ends up being far superior. You grind out for your gear(similar) but when you get your gear, the POWER FANTASY kicks in and you literally melt mobs in your search for incremental upgrades to do that more efficiently. Contrast that with this game where you grind out your gear and the challenge stays the same. Enemies still absolutely destroy you with minimal effort. There is no power fantasy. That’s what looter games are supposed to be. You grind to become powerful so you can zone out and shred monsters chasing the next incremental upgrade. That doesn’t happen in division and on the off chance it does it’s INSTANTLY PATCHED. The loop is boring

I still love the game despite its flaws but honestly when I tried to log in and saw I was banned I was t sad I wasn’t bothered in the least. I chuckled and said oh well.  That’s what THE DIVISION HAS BECOME... A CHUCKLE AND AN OH WELL. 

That’s a bigger problem then a bunch of people who glitched the system for a few days/weeks.

fsdfdp,Deep_six_6,"The feedback loop and the problem with ""looter shooters""","Buckle up, I'm about to turn your world upside down.

I have a lot of friends who play Division 2. Most of them don't play anymore. I still play almost every day, but not the way you do. 

There is a fundamental problem with looter shooters. The idea that the goal of the game is to get loot, where the loot is designed to just make you stronger, is the problem. I've been asking this and I am ALWAYS met with blank stare type responses. 

When you grind for days or weeks (some of you boast about farming months for a gun)... what next? 

I'll tell you. You use that gun, maybe all the time, maybe it lets you down, maybe you get bored. But no matter what, you immediately use it to help you begin a new mindless farming campaign for another piece of gear. 

It is a heroin addict's feedback loop.

My friends, the ones who don't have fun any more, who get pissed off when progress gets stuck on heroic, who refuse to play a lower difficulty and actually have FUN... they have become slaves to the feedback loop. 

""This is so fucking pointless. The loot sucks on challenging. I'm getting off.""

FUCK THE LOOT! 

Are you so shitty at the game that you NEED the best, milking every little percentage point, farming, farming, FARMING forever to get a better stat roll? No, you're not. You are skilled. That's why you are already farming on the highest difficulty. But you are NEVER having fun. Don't even pretend you are. 

You're playing wrong. Lower your difficulty. Change your guns all the time. Try new things. Have some fun. 

Playing through to level 30 and beating the story was the most fun any game has ever given me for 3$ (yes, bought it on the sale, then put another 50$ into it.)

There is a highly upvoted post about begging the developers to not listen to streamers. Well, I say don't listen to the people who spend dozens or hundreds of hours playing the same mission over and over for a piece of gear that they will just use to do the SAME FUCKING THING with.

For one thing: get a fucking life. Games are terrific, obviously we love them here. You could have played the entirety of the original Mass Effect trilogy in the amount of time you spent farming for your bulletking or whatever.

You could have played the entirety of Jedi Fallen Order in the time you spent farming one mission 20... 30... 40? However many times. 

Play with some friends. Use a stupid specialization (sup, gunner? Sweet pulse btw.) Do the dailies and weeklys and fuck off with your farming.

Now, a lot of people will say: mind your business, play your own way, I'll play mine, get good, etc. Well fine. But if that's how you feel then please shut the fuck up about your demands for changes to the game. Changes that reinforce the feedback loop. It isn't fucking fun, it's awful and infinitely wasteful and it IS. NOT. FUCKING. FUN.

Next time you wipe on heroic from a 1 hit bs death... drop to challenging, and kill shit. Realize you can run around the map again. Realize you can play different playstyles without spending dozens or hundreds of hours ""perfecting"" your new build that you will just use to farm for another build. 

Have fun and endless farmers fuck off

Also, the pieces for Liberty do not drop although i have the 1st one from Capitol Story.

And so after several back and forth with the support thay are asking me to show a video of these loots not dropping. Which means i already did all this content once, and now i have to do it a second time, just for them to see the issue.

Well guess what, they have ""relevant evidence"" of me glitching so i bet they should be able to track my progress and see stuff is not dropping (especially since these components cannot be deleted, it's either there in your ressources tab/crafting table or not). But i guess fixing the game is less important than banning people.

BTW, i'll never play Division again, but if i had to do, in the same situation (ie bullet spungy, ridiculous drop chances, exotics locked behind silly missions/assignments) i would do it again. You can't expect people to follow the rules when the rules are so dumb.

fsdc4j,SHDeathtravel,"I'm glad Massive has finally Ban more bug players, but I also regret that they didn't realize their problems.","So little content, so many bugs, so abnormal values. This is the New York DLC.

The Massive team will never have to admit that the error originated from themselves, and never need to compensate players for these bugs .

\--Because the players they hurt will no longer play their games.

This situation is repeated every time, this time it is just more intense.

In fact, all problems and disputes have only one root cause: Massive has maked a fxk DLC, which has been titled ""New York"" to attract players.

For this incident, I think what Massive should do is to refund all players. Such bad and numerous BUG, ​​this DLC can already be called a scam!

I won't spend any more money for Massive games in the future, this is a liar studio.

fsdb7i,NomadicMo,a Dialogue about the mass ban,"Hello Agents/Devs/Reps,

I was one of the many who were banned for utilizing the DPS Glitch. Now, there is a great deal of angst and a lot of hasty responses from Agents on this subeditor, and twitter. I understand the ban, and even the removal of items gained in the exploit of the Glitch, however, there are two inconsistent points I'd like to bring to your attention for discussion. 

1 – Ban Statistics 

On Discord, there are a significant number of players who had used the DPS Glitch in PVP and PVE, and faced no bans. There are also a large number of players reportedly never used the exploit and had matchmade with an Agent who had used the ban, and were banned in turn. I’ll tackle the latter first. 

We don’t know the validity of those reports. According to Yanick, those who employed the Turret Glitch were banned. Now, if they are running metrics, agents like myself would appear, however, I don’t see how anyone who joined a session already in progress be targeted, if their metrics were accurate. This requires further reports from agents, and further investigation to this if this is accurate, as Agents whom did not know their party member was running the exploit, should not have faced the repercussions. 

As for the former, there are a handful of Agents I play with who did employ the Glitch and faced no ban. Furthermore, there are a few youtubers I’ve known to have used the glitch, whom have faced no repercussion. This is an issue that should be significantly considered in the extreme measures taken by the devs. 

Furthermore, there are reports of E-Mails that were sent to Agents before the Ban. I would like to know more about this.

2 – Ramifications 

This is a harsh imposition by Massive. While I was fumed by this, I do understand it. The reality is, and I can only speak for myself, most of the players who used this, did not do it consistently. In my instance, I used the exploit for the cosmetics, and ran the legendries once per area for the cosmetics, and upon the warning post about the exploit in the Reddit, I ceased with the DPS Glitch.  That was more than a week ago. I was recently made redundant due to COVID, and had spent a significant amount of time on the Division like a lot of other Agents, and I spent the past week or so playing legitimately with my group, hunted all the hunters, farmed level 4 control points, and god knows how many normal activities. 

I mention this not for appeal, but for a voice for silent majority, hindered by the loud majority of both sides. I spent hours daily farming legitimately, and I am certain a large majority of players have done the same. The bans, while left me with a bad taste in my mouth, are justifiable, albeit employed in the wrong way. Yet I fail to see a reasonable justification for the roll back. If Agents ceased after the post, why are they being impacted now? And why was there no warning that all their activities post the 17th would be reset? I don’t expect anything to change given the nature of my suspension and rollback, I did the crime, and I will do the time, but I would like to start an open dialogue with those who may have been impacted, and the developers. 

Let me know your thoughts. Please keep this civil, do not bash players, or the devs.",0,1585662901,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsdb7i/a_dialogue_about_the_mass_ban/,thedivision,1
fsdau2,waktivist,"Just want to say thanks to Massive for the great work on TU 8.5. I'm just a console casual scrub, but I can feel a difference today and it feels good.","Logged in and ripped through the first zone of checkoffs for Venus in Downtown East. Cleared the control points, one bounty, and the mission, all on normal.

Obviously this is a short and very shallow sampling, but from my perspective as a player who started a couple months ago in late TU7 era, it feels very much like the game on normal mode is back to where it was before WONY. Haven't tried anything in New York yet or on higher difficulties.

Here are a few specific things that I noticed, some of which were not mentioned as fixes in the patch notes (Xbox btw):

* Enemy health and armor on normal was being taken down noticeably faster by my gunfire and my skills, in the open world and in missions.
* Enemy damage and AOE in particular feels more reasonable now, and I felt like I always had a chance to evade or counter fire and was not being surprise one-shotted by anything.
* Assault Turret and Striker Drone no longer blinded or inactive in mist or rain.
* Skills usually stayed up for their full duration instead of being killed soon after deployment.
* Enemies no longer spawning or pathing into hidden / stuck positions in Washington Hotel (you know the spot I mean if you were there yesterday).

Finally, it also seems like something was stealth fixed with matchmaking, because for the first time in two months I logged in and started clearing CPs solo, with ""open group"" set, and I had people join the group within a minute and it soon filled up, and refilled when people left. Maybe coincidental, but I've never had group joins like that while just roaming around in what feels like ages.

Overall, I'll just say, it feels like fun again, like back when I first played through the DC campaign. All of the control points we cleared turned into crazy intense firefights with a couple of extra random patrols or convoys stumbling through in the middle, but even when things went nuts, and people might have went down once or twice, it didn't feel frustrating or annoying. It felt really fun, and I felt like an actual Division Agent again.

No more one-shot random deaths from bullshit out of nowhere, no more skills being blown up as soon as they were deployed. And when I got shot or hit with AOE, I at least had time to react, counter, get in cover, and stay in the fight instead of just being instant downed out of nowhere. I did not feel any noticeable difference from the previous TU 8.4 tuning, but today, at first impression, it feels like things have been adjusted in a good and noticeable way.

Again, this is all on normal so maybe there still are issues on higher difficulties. But I can say so far, ""easy mode"" feels actually easy again, and it was a much more fun, relaxing experience to just log in, grind up some seasonal and SHD levels, and leave wanting to come back for more right away.

Anyway, I just want to say thanks to everyone at Massive for the continued hard work on the game even in this time, and for making changes that are noticeable and make the game feel like it's moving in a good direction and coming back from some of the problems it has had. Thank you all. From my perspective, at least, it's good work, and well appreciated.",2,1585662862,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsdau2/just_want_to_say_thanks_to_massive_for_the_great/,thedivision,1

fsd8as,GERANGER,I was probably one of the worst glitchers and didn’t get banned,"For reference I’m a PC player with about 10 days in game since the game went on sale. Used to play on console at launch and dropped when the first waves of nerfs came in. Currently at nearly 300 SHD rank atm. 

Let me explain, I got on the train a little late (a few days in) since I was feeling quite bored and wanted a different kind of challenge. Heroic ain’t much and legendary was a no go for a solo player like myself. I’d heard the buzz about some “dps glitch” and checked out some videos and it seemed simple enough. Ran into some initial problems but ultimately got it to work okay. 

I’d figured my next step was to solo the 3 strongholds on legendary. I was certainly up to it but I was still struggling pretty bad. Something wierd happened later that seemed push my dmg through the roof like I’m talking like 13 digits. It was still quite the task. I’d started with the arena first since I thought it’d be the worst one and boy was I right. CQC is hell with enemy dmg output but I had finally succeeded after 4 hours and got... well nothing. Next up was Roosevelt which I was expecting to be the easiest of the 3 and I actually got this one first try funnily enough and even put up a decent time for the speed run(17 minutes), my PB is about 15. And from that one I also got... nothing. Lastly was capital fittingly as that’s where endgame begins and apparently ends [for me in a weird way ig]. As expected took about 4 solid attempts and about an hour and got... nothing out of this either.  

Overall I had a great experience with the damage glitch and I’m glad I came away unscathed unlike some others. I did all three in one sitting so I definitely did suffer the next day in terms of sleep (I played until the maintainence that day). It was a whole new  experience for me and I was glad to be able experience it. I had a blast. The game was getting dull for me at the time and that’s what really held me over. I seriously think the devs should consider a ‘hardcore’ difficulty because I was having a ton of fun and it felt a fair challenge when both the enemies and I are on a [relatively] equal playing field. 

I have been killed in the DZ by people with some very sketchy dmg figures and dealt with frame drops that were occurring quite frequently. Lost 2 hollow masks and a Pestilence while trying to play at 8 FPS attempting to pvp some dude with stinger hive. You can only imagine. Haven’t been in since. 

I do think the devs should do something for the community to make up for the current state of the game atm. It’s not looking to good all around from what I’m hearing. Maybe a little something in everyone’s mailbox? ;) would love to see them own up to their obvious lack of internal testing with how WONY has gone so far.

TL;DR I used the damage glitch to solo legendary and had a blast doing so and haven’t had the same level of fun since then.",52,1585662594,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsd8as/i_was_probably_one_of_the_worst_glitchers_and/,thedivision,1

fsd4uk,ThatzGcplays,striker gearset rework idea," i think that i have somewhat of a idea for a eventual striker rework (since the set can't compete with other DPS builds in the game)

keep in mind that this was based off what some legendary DPS builds can do in the game, and the striker gearsets current performance is really underwhelming compared to those builds.

\-2 piece bonus: +20% magazine size or +20% critical hit damage (instead of +15% weapon handling) 

\-3pc bonus: +15% fire rate (untouched)

 \-4pc bonus: striker's gamble 

each normal hit gives a stack of +0.5% weapon damage up to 50 stacks, critical hits give a additional stack of +0.5% critical hit damage up to 50 stacks and headshot hits give a stack of +0.5% armor regeneration per second up to 25 stacks, 2 stacks for the weapon damage and critical hit damage bonus are lost each shot missed and 1 is lost every second without hitting, 3 stacks for the armor regeneration bonus are lost each shot missed and 2 are lost every second without hitting. 

\-backpack bonus: striker's overdrive.

stacks can overstack up to a maximum double of their limit, each stack that goes over the limit gets consumed once you kill a enemy, killing a enemy with a normal hit gives you +0.5% fire rate for each stack for 10 seconds, killing a enemy with a critical hit gives you and your team +1% critical hit damage for each stack for 20 seconds and killing a enemy with a headshot hit gives you and your team +0.5% armor regeneration/second for each stack for 4 seconds.

\-chest piece bonus: striker's weapon maestry

 semi automatic weapons get a additional 2 stacks each hit, SMGs get 0.2% increased mobility from stacks up to a maximum of 10% and ARs and LMGs get increased health damage up to 20%, shotgun misses do not count if at least half the pellets hit the target.",2,1585662208,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsd4uk/striker_gearset_rework_idea/,thedivision,1

you can make the argument that the guy that abused this for weeks and had a 3 minute clear on the raids could be subject to a full wipe.  There needs to be a difference between the two tyoes of users.

Yes , I know they shouldnt be doing it but if I was one of those people, I dont think that is all that of a fair punishment.  I think the appropriate approach would be have been more lenient on the first time through with a warning that full account wipes on the second offense could be handed down, would be a better approach.

[Over the course of the last few days I abused the glitches heavily. please taker a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA6PsTLMti8&amp;feature=youtu.be) I am not afraid to say it. I found a good group that knew how to be effectiv. We had 1 reviver and 3 people with miniguns at 1000rpm. As you can see in the video every hit was a kill. I saw alot of loot. And when I say alot I mean thousands of items over the days. I deconstructed over 1500 exotics. Most of them with 0 max rolls. I looked at targeted loot. I looked at normal loot. I got one upgrade for my build. It was a perfect coyote mask. 


It took us about 13 hours to get 4 perfect lady deaths.


It took us about 20 minutes to get over 10 perfect coyote masks.


It took us no extra time to get more than 4 perfect bstu gloves because they dropped from coyote too. (I dont really get why)


We never got 4 perfect Bighorns in a little over 10 hours.


We never got 4 perfect Merciless. We got 1.


We got 1 perfect Nemesis over the full time we did the exploit.


I myself got 13 perfect Sweet dreams.


I myself got 4 perfect Liberties.


I myself got 2 perfect Sawyer Kneepads.


and the underpowered holsters dropped a few times too.


Overall it wasnt a good heist. It showed me and many other people I talked to how worthless high difficulty content really is. All I did with the perfect exotics I kept was put them in the stash to rot. Using an M1A and MG5 was/is still better for clearspeed.

I really hope atleast 1 person read this book and reconsiders spending hours upon hours farming for exotics. If you are having fun redoing content over and over fine but dont farm for exotics.

- Control Points DONT reset
- NPCS run at the speed of light and are still bullet spongy. 
-Striker stacks don’t even fkin work sometimes
- Negotiators doesn’t even register upon a critical hit sometimes.
- Revive Hive was made in China
- Exotics are just discounted versions of their previous selfs. 
- Mods EVERYWHERE
- Purples in a Legendary? You gotta be fkin me rn Massive?
- Poison damage gets fixed, but you realize fire damage is what’s killing players.

Massive, if you think you’ve made some ingenious moral move, you’re wrong. A LOT of people who benefited from this glitch willingly get to continue to play the game. 

In my opinion, this mass ban is a blanket to cover how broken the game is and was only done so that it would appease those who were complaining about it. 

Whether you agree with the ban or not, the game is still broken and this is not fixing it.

fsbry3,Boyefran,We need to talk about NPC behavior at increased difficulties. (From a console player’s perspective),"I’d just like to dive right in and start with this: having NPCs run around endlessly when you’re in mid range like chickens that are freshly decapitated is not harder difficulty— it’s just simply not fun. 

I do realize that this may be to incentivize players to use crowd control abilities, but to that I’d still have to say the same and add that the controls for certain skills for a console player are an absolute nightmare. This might be an issue across the board no matter the platform— please tell me if so. If not, then I suggest you try out the division 2 with a controller if you’re able. 

I look at gameplay for D2 of players completing legendary content (legitimately) and the majority of it is really only on PC. I don’t consider myself a bad player. I do like to work my own builds out rather than emulate others and study harder content in order to beat it and teach others on console effective strategies. However, this is all voided out by how bad the game is to control with skills like the Artillery Turret and at times the firefly. Above all is the chem launcher aiming. I actually just stressed myself out just by typing the name of the skill. That is how annoying and clunky it works on a controller. 

This impedes on your gameplay in such a big way that I feel like console players and PC players are playing different games. So, now we circle back to NPCs and the behavior and movements taking into account how not only are you fighting with the controls a lot of the time to get things to aim properly and work— you have NPCs on top of that running in every direction that would make sense to only implement and balance around the precision of a keyboard and mouse. Even then if your positing with your team is flanking either side and another member is directly in front the NPC loses their shit and starts having convulsions and doing quick left to right shifts in cover until you scream in horror and put it out of its misery. Which also happens to be exactly how I wish for you to deal with the code for your NPC AI.

I don’t understand why you took all of that downtime in gathering players for some sort of focus group in an effort to make this game better only to keep the things that felt broken and break it even further than it was previously. The negative response to your game isn’t just about the insanely poor rolls on loot due to having too many bonuses in the pool or the balancing of skills— it’s because it doesn’t feel fun to play. Which is why you see the majority of players using the set-it-and-forget-it option to their skills over all others. 

I still really like the game and see it’s potential as being a great multiplatform rpg-esque looter, but if I have to fight with the games controls in order to use more of what the game has to offer I’m sadly probably going to just call it quits.",4,1585656492,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fsbry3/we_need_to_talk_about_npc_behavior_at_increased/,thedivision,1

fsbowq,PhilipChrs,Are you kidding me Massive? (Weapon Mods),"So I decided to buy the game on Xbox (with expansion and 30 lvl boost) and I have previously played on PS4... Just finished with the NY campaign and decided to go after weapon mods. Then I read ""Unlock at Vendors, Projects or by beating LVL 4 Control Points"". 
OK I check Vendors -&gt; Nothing. Projects -&gt; 1 available. So I am pretty much left to Control Points. I know from previous play that LVL 3 was hard enough and time consuming because u had to raise lvl first (problably 1 hour for each), and now its LVL 4?!? Unless the difficulty of Control Points has been decreased massively since 6 months ago, I will say that its a much much tedious and impossible task to perform solo. I was never able to do lvl 4 back then...

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to the lastest annoucement with DPS glitch and rollback accounts, I support that.

On the other hand I have a question for you.

Since players that gained loot by glitching will have those items taken back, what about the players that lost all the loot from bugged missions/skills.. CP not reseting.. etc

&amp;#x200B;

Will you give all the blueprints and good loot to players that had nothing to do in the game because of you BS game full of bugs? 

I still miss alot of blueprints and had shit loot (purples on heroic). What about us and the time lost in game grinding for absolutely nothing but trash loot because of all these exiting bugs that are in the game for a month or even more?

fsbcqa,Hi-ImChaos,"Disappointed. Not even mad, just disappointed","Division 2 oh what a lovely game they say. Maybe I said it once or twice. But now with this I can’t say it anymore. You want to to suspend players who used a glitch. Let’s talk about that. I used the damage glitch. Guess what other glitch I used the revive hive glitch (you know the one you left in the game sense release). What about the invisible boxes we would get stuck in before you put in the unplayable zone timer. 

Do you know why I used the glitch because you released content that allowed me to finish the whole season by week 3 (and I don’t even play hardcore) but then you want to go and suspend my account and roll back my save so does that mean that I’m gonna lose the legitimate gear and apparel I’ve gained sense then if so I’d like my money back. I spent money on those keys. I did it to kill some enemies on even playing field I have 4 days played on one character and the npc’s are so imbalanced that I can’t survive against them even tho I’ve been optimized for awhile now. But because I don’t play a tank build means fuck you. 

I’m mostly just disappointed you punish the people who want to enjoy your game on their terms. 

I remember the days when a game came out and that was the game glitches remained and it was up to the players to have their own moral compass on wether to use them or not. 

Just disappointed. This is probably goodbye for awhile because I can’t do it again. I came back 1 time and was fine came back a 2nd perfect. But I don’t know The Division 2 will be getting strike 3.

fsb1xy,JokerUnique,Account suspensions and rollback for DPS glitch,"#Account suspensions

We were recently made aware of a bug that could be exploited and allowed players to increase their damage to an unintended amount. In accordance to our Code of Conduct we will suspend accounts of those who have systematically exploited this so called “DPS Glitch” in order to gain an unfair in-game advantage. The use of this exploit has negatively impacted the game’s economy, leaderboards, been hugely detrimental in PVP and has negatively affected the enjoyment of the game for many.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Players who have exploited this bug will receive a one-week suspension starting immediately and will be unable to play Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 during this time. Furthermore, sanctioned players accounts will be flagged and any further offense will result in a permanent suspension.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
In addition, the sanctioned players accounts will be rolled back to a save from March 17th, causing all account progress gained during this period to be reset.

fsaou2,strizzl,Patriot + pestilence is broken in DZ,"Stack 4 true patriot, as much incoming heal as you can and use pestilence. Mark as many targets as you can and you will be unkillable in PvP. The tick damage from pestilence allows the player to be healed from multiple targets at once if the white debuff is active. 

IMO there are several ways to fix this: 1. Allow only one targets worth of healing at a time 2. Apply a healing PVP modifier like there is for all healing skills (about 50% reduction in heals). 3. The change I hope they don’t make is disabling the tick damage from healing the player as that removes a unique synergy that is an interesting PVP and PVE mechanic. 

Devs, please look into this. Once this build picks up, this will be worse than glitching.

On a related note, players can be tagged with negotiator dilemma then killed by the ND user shooting NPCs. This needs to be changed as well.

fs94yt,WickedWiggins,Cosmetics and Masks in this game,"Look, I’m a simple guy, I like cosmetics in my games. Almost too much... but I feel that having a good fashion sense really does increase your immersion in the game and in the world. If I love the game (in this case I do) I’ll even throw money at the developers and buy some cool stuff! However, I need to address this because I feel like it’s been swept under the rug a lot. The cosmetics in D2 suck... it’s sad but true. Recently they did add the hunter outfit into the game which is awesome! That’s probably my favorite, but everything else just kinda blows. I understand that game design and tuning comes first. You need to be able to play and enjoy the game before you go buying cosmetics in it! (Duh) BUT having something cool to wear is also good! These are a few of my issues with cosmetics.

1. Masks float on your face: 
They float on your face and there’s no ski mask underneath like in D1 and it’s just kind of odd. It’s almost as if your skin or face MUST be visible for some reason. Update the masks! Add some ski masks underneath. Especially to the hunter masks. 

2. The clothing in the game is just ok:
Nothing cool or breathtaking just ok. It’s boring! The first game had awesome gas masks and tactical shirts and pants with padding and elbow pads and what not. Most of the stuff in this game is just a tank top or t-shirt or button up. It’s just meh. 

3. We need to be able to earn more cosmetics:
It feels really rewarding to complete a difficult task or mission and earn a cool outfit. I’ve got the white black tusk uniform and honestly I love it. They did great with this outfit and if we had more stuff like this I would be very content! Maybe in the next season add more outfits into the season pass to earn or unlock! 

I understand that I sound like I’m complaining and I apologize if I’m coming off that way. I realize it’s harder to work on things right now due to this virus. I would like Massive to know that I appreciate the world they’ve crafted with The Division. The lore, the gameplay, and the missions are so interesting and entertaining. I would love to support this game in anyway and I see cosmetics as a good start. I don’t mind buying them but I really would like it if they would implement more unlockables just as the first game had them. That’s all I got to say. Thanks for reading!

fs90u3,g0ku737,Targeted Loot not working - Recalibration Backpack/Chest?,"Hey everyone,

1) I Played a few missions Yesterday with my Friends. We chose the Missions by the available targeted Loot..

We Play on Heroic with 2 Directives..

In the whole mission i dropped 3 Parts of the Targeted Brand set and 5 from other Brands or Mods..

In contrast on every Control Point Level 4 i get 6+ Items form the Targeted Brand of that Area in maybe 15% of the Time. 

Massive please look into this. It is not funny to play a Heroic mission without restart for lets say 45 Minutes just to drop 50% of the loot of a Check Point in 300% of the Time.

In Missions the drops from Random NPCs in the different rooms is so rare.. maybe every 3 rooms 1-2 Pieces an then not even targeted.. on a Checkpoint you get an Item on every 4-5th Enemy and its most of the time targeted.


2) The Difficulty to get a good roll.. not even a god roll is so hard for some a Chests or Backpacks because they always drop with an Skill Mod Slot for example. With all variables together wich are 5  i have to get 4 right on the drop so that i can recalibrate one thing to make the item usable which is always the mod slot in some cases.. this is way too hard.

For every other Item Mask,Kneepads, Glives etc. The chance is much higher you need only 2 out of 3.

I played for 2 week now around 3-5 hours a day and was not able to find only 1 Chest or Backpack that has the wanted combination.

Please allow us to recalibrate an Attribute and the Mod Slot/Talent differently so i am able to modify items with fixed mod slots at least a little bit easier. Out of 25 items there is one that looks okay but is then trash when only one Attribute or the talent is not correct.. that ist not rewarding it is making me not enjoy the Loot at the end of a few hours grinding on every day...

But.... I still die to fire in 2 sec and 1or 2 shots by grenade so I just fuck it and use glass cannon instead. Yolo style. No need to wait for damage build up. I can quick shoot then sit back in cover. Also blind fire with full damage. Down side is 1 tiny mistake ( or not)​and I am dead.

fs7dt7,Blob856,How The Division went from my favorite game to my least favorite in one update.,"Let me preface this by saying this is from the prospective of a skill player so this is all I'm going to be talking about, but everyone uses skills so I shouldn't be alone on this. Alright to start things off in my eyes the thing that made the division unique from other 3rd person shooters were the skills. They were always my favorite thing about the game and after this recent expansion I just end every game session asking why they have so many unneeded flaws or just bugs, I honestly can't tell you if they are intentional or not because they just make no sense. For example the seeker mine, well it doesnt seek so not sure why they kept the name but thats besides the point why does the airburst not work around some cover? An example of this is in the test range try using the airburst and you'll see it does nothing and unlike the other ""seekers"" you cant throw it so if you are in a situation where it just doesnt work you lose 50% of your damage as a skill player, and this isnt even taking into account that even when you can use it there is a large chance it wont hit anything anyway or just get kicked by a heavy. I could go on about this for every skill in the game like why does the hive just not shoot people that are in line of site and also in the radius or the Artificer hive that says it resets the duration of skills but it just doesn't anymore or the turret not targeting enemies when its raining or my favorite the firefly that destroys weak points but if the weak point explodes (like the majority of weak points) its just blows itself up. Now I could forgive alot of these dumb things before because I could usually fix some of the flaws with mods but now we dont have those so if the skill tier doesnt buff that stat then I can't fix that problem. As an example I can no longer increase the radius of the hive or the amount of charges it has so the blindspot that it has for some reason is way more noticeable. As someone who uses skills for most of my damage having things just not work constantly and getting killed because of it is so beyond frustrating. Also why did they just straight nerf some skills like super drastically for no reason? Like before this update my flame turret lasted for about 800 seconds which was great because of how nerfed it is compared to the division 1 version but after the update its like 100 seconds... why? Or the booster hive at SKILL TIER 6 only lasting 5 seconds. Honestly I just needed to vent this frustration because I had so much fun with skill builds in the division 1 from healing builds to firecrest turrets to just simple skill damage builds and now everything just sucks. Sorry for the rant but I just needed to get this out for myself or anyone that also feels this way. Anyways have a nice day and stay safe out there.",66,1585633664,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fs7dt7/how_the_division_went_from_my_favorite_game_to_my/,thedivision,1

Had a clanmate just run a test with a named target with 3 different guns. A P416, Famas, and Police M4. The final DPS result was within 4 points.

To further this, I posted a screenshot of one of my tests earlier...mine was 19,789,228. There is no way that we could have numbers the same like that when we have different builds. 

Clanmate's gun info (All using STRAINED):

* Famas has 12% ar damage, 9.5% health damage, and 6% damage to armor. Total damage is 91.9k.
* P416 has 12% ar damage, 11% health damage, and 9% damage to targets out of cover. Total damage is 102.7k.
* M4 has 13% ar damage, 7.5% health damage, and 7.5% chc. Total damage is 95.6k.

fs6fjb,Rathelas,Can we talk about Armor Regen?,"I was looking at the brand set bonuses and thought, 'what if I stack Gila x3, Golan x2 and 1 Emperor Murakami kneepads for armor regen bonuses, and have 1 slot per piece max rolled armor regen...'

Then I did napkin math:
1% from Golan 2 piece
1% from Gila 3 piece
1% from Murakami knees
Lets round it up to 5k/hp per gear piecr, 6 pieces, 30k total.

3% of lets say 1mil, you have 30k. Thats a total of 60k per sec. TERRIBLE!

I think armor regen per piece needs to go up to a max of 9k per piece. And the brandset bonuses be reworked to 1.5% PER PIECE as long as you unlock the 2/3 set.
Meaning at 3 piece gila, you get 4.5% and another 3% from 2 piece Golan or heck go all Gila and cap-out at 9%. And up the Murakami knees to 3%.

This would bring us to say 10.5% + 70k [9k * 6] = 150,000 per sec. Investing half your stats into it you should damn well be able to get your armor back in 10 seconds. Your set bonuses have almost no damage stats too.

fs69jb,flourishersvk,State of the game for returning solo player?,"Hey! 

So I've been thinking about spending some time playing TD2. I've played a bit on launch but never really got into it. But back than all I did was play video games so every game got boring quickly. But I can definitely remember that I didn't like the skins and clothes in TD2 compared to the first game. Which I played basically until TD2 released so I'm not new to the game. 

I read a lot about issues the game has now. OP bullet sponge enemies, one shot deaths etc. And tbh if this is a case for raids and other group activities it's not a huge deal for me since I plan on spending 90% of my time in Dark Zone. I always enjoyed being sneaky and extracting my loot. I kinda gave up on survival since it feels like devs don't give a shit about what players want. But there's the NYC DLC and I'd love to see it in TD2. 

So bottom line. How's the game for a solo player these days?",9,1585628412,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fs69jb/state_of_the_game_for_returning_solo_player/,thedivision,1

fs5y51,Ralfzer0,Why do we even need friendly npcs?," I will say this as nice as possible.

Look, i am not one of those guys who have been crying since the dlc came out.

I changed my playstyle in order to be able to be ""successful"" in this game.

I am also not one of these players who are grinding heroics/legendaries all day long.

That being said, i recognize that some content of this game is meant for ""hardcore"" players.

After 80+ hours of playing since the dlc came out, im at a point where i can solo heroics.

I like the difficulty that this game offers.

I know there are a lot of bugs, and things that need to be fixed, although i rarely rant about how this game is shit and how the devs should play legendary missions (which is an awesome idea, i would pay an other 30$ just to see them go through a legendary mission) and blah blah blah

BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

FIX THE SHITTY NPCS THAT ARE BLOCKING ME.

Doing CP4, while, not 1 BUT 2 Elite patrols come over, throwing 32987432987 grenades on me and 389237492847 mortars, while rushers are coming from everywhere.

Meanfuckingwhile, im STUCK because the FRIENDLY npc decided to come and sit on top of me, making me unable to move, and when i finally manage to escape, THERE IS NOWHERE FOR ME TO GO BECAUSE ALL COVER IS TAKEN FROM THE NPCS.

Which btw are useless since Div1, and we still dont have the option to ""take them out"" like fuck em, i dont need them, allow me to play without any ""friendly reinforcements"".

Either fix your stupid NPCS, or allow us to disable it.

Difficulty wise, they are...subjective,ok with that.

What is horribly wrong is the veterancy of mobs and the fact we cant control it, is is the biggest  ""fk you!"" to solo players you could do.
4 manning an heroic is only slightly worse than solo a mission but the mob density is roughly twice as much and the mobs are basically all elites.
Soloing meaning fewer mobs and mostly normal and veterans. It's easy to figure out how bad the loot is in solo/duo missions compared to four.
Not asking for a buff to drops for solo players, but just a slider to control NPCs veterancy, so we can increase the overall difficulty of a mission to get better loot.

fs3zvs,Thy-Savior,Did the Rikers kill LMB or JTF in the Financial District?,"In an audio log with Duchess and Dragov, Duchess mentions that she cleared out the LMB from the Stock Exchange building (calling bs on that because the LMB were shown to be getting supplied by Black Tusk after Bliss's death and the LMB were already a force to be reckoned with. Highly doubt Rikers could clear them out but ok).

But in the Animated Short Ubisoft released it was shown Dragov was clearing out the Stock Exchange and the LMB there were actually Ex-LMB-gone-JTF.

Now, let's exclude the Animated Short and the confusion it causes story-wise. 

There's no way that could have happened while Bliss was alive because the LMB pulled out of the Financial District and refused to protect Wall Street files since they were worthless. So then they relocated further up North (as seen in the Division 1). Even if the LMB stayed in that area Bliss would have sent more troops down there to reclaim it, along with the Rogue Agents that had joined the LMB.

If this event occurred after Bliss's death then why would the LMB be down in the Financial District again? Doesn't make sense.

Going back to the Animated Short now to follow up on the sentences right above. I could see some of the LMB joining the JTF after Bliss and then being directed to go back down to Wall Street. If this happened then why was Duchess calling them LMB still if it was plainly shown the Ex-LMB had JTF lettering on their apparel now?

Stay with the library idea, where you can extract one talent, then be able to craft the exotic with all on the levels currently in the library. So that way you are constantly progressing to the perfect exotic. But make the crafting materials exclusively to the exotic you broke down. Have it just like our library now, if you break it down for a stat, you don't get any materials, but to craft it, you need to farm for that specific exotic for to get those specific materials. That way the Dev's still make us farm for them and we don't get stuck with crap rolls.

Even with a 100% uptime they essentially only add 15% WD and you lose 12% chd or 6% chc and more importantly 15% Dmg OoC. It is about a 12% loss in dps and the added armor and ignore explosion simply does not make up for it. 

They would become more interesting with either a communal ignore explosion or 15-20% group dps. It would give real legs to the TP with Overwatch as a group support build.

fs0xrv,WildLeon,A new players opinion on skill builds after 60 hours.,"Organizing my main issues into bullet points so that its easier to read and even point out my flawed thinking or provide suggestions. Again, its an opinion, and opinions can be factually wrong, so if theres something I am missing please let me know.

I am a ""relatively"" new Division 2 player. I played quite a bit of Division 1 however many issues prevented me from enjoying it as much as i'd liked to, but I always enjoyed skill builds. They were unique and brought tools to the table that other agents didnt have. Eventually the way skills were balanced (or lack of) cut some of my enjoyment as well. I played Division 2 on launch and felt some of the same issues were there, and couldnt bring myself to enjoy it.

With warlords of New York being released I thought I'd come back and give it a try. Used to some of the similar systems I wanted to try a skill build. The first 4 hours was probably spent looking for Skill power if I am honest. Skill tier is rather new but after looking into the system itself it seemed like a more streamlined option. After using it, it feels extremely weak in nearly every situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* Skills themselves either dont do enough damage when invested in, especially when you sacrifice so much health or weapon damage to improve them.
* Skills themselves have unusual scaling, even within the same skill. Explosive Seeker mine, and Cluster Seeker mine both get +10% damage per tier. Why doesnt the single target one have a higher multiplier? The base damage helps, but why have 1 Seeker for 2m damage, when you can have 9 for 1.5m. The bleed is largely irrelivant it feels and rarely makes a difference. Sticky bomb also gets the same 10% damage but even with the haste% it still ends up being the same cooldown as a seeker mine, for largely the same damage.
* Some skills are far to clunky to use reliably, and take away from what I could be doing on a red build, which is actually killing the enemy. Firefly, Im looking at you. The time it takes me to pull it out, aim at the targets and try and get the finicky reticle to lock onto them a red build would have killed it already.
* ""Heavy"" enemies are the bane of my existence. They seem to ignore fire, even on an 80% Status effect/60% skill damage build, explosive damage helps, but not as much as I feel it should, and the oxidizer feels like it should ""inherently"" help with the issue, but doesnt. Honestly the best choice is to use the sniper turret and pump out 2m damage every second and break an armor piece, but if I wanted to use a sniper wouldnt I just go red and use a sniper?
* Im very limited by my cooldowns, which is to be expected, but my cooldowns do not feel impactful. Every tool I have is useful in a specific situation, but nearly useless in others. Frequently I find myself swapping a skill mid mission to tackle an enemy. Armored Wardogs? Explosives dont cut through the armor enough, but EMP Pulse does amazing but its only good for electronics. Normal enemies? Its mostly turret as thats the only thing that feels impactful on a reasonable cooldown.
* Because I am giving up weapon damage, and tankiness I need to keep a skill open to heal and keep me and the team alive. This limits my options even futher, since while my ""damage"" skills deal damage, its less impactful than riot foaming an enemy and letting my teammates shoot it while keeping them topped up with a hive. Because I sure as hell dont do weapon damage in a reliable sense.
* I feel like a jack of all trades, not a master of skills.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand there are plenty of pieces of gear that tailor to a skill build, but they feel outclassed by other builds and gear.",34,1585607830,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fs0xrv/a_new_players_opinion_on_skill_builds_after_60/,thedivision,1

fs0hhd,Frost_King907,"I think the ""half-shield"" in the game needs a rework in one of two directions, let's discuss.","So I'm sure most of you have seen, or are currently running, this combo of a rifle &amp; half shield. This has started to bug me for a couple of reasons, but namely it's because the marksman rifles, which in this iteration of the game are sort if lacking comparatively, and LMGs aren't allowed when using this half shield.

...now full disclosure I'm of the thought process that rifles should *NOT* be an allowed weapon from the half shield, and should be placed in the same category as it's sister weapon the MMR. I don't necessarily believe the rifle should be a weapon class that should be able to operate from behind a shield given it's big damage &amp; crit potential. I'm not saying touch rifles at all, you absolutely should be able to peel a guys melon from a block away in PvP if he's running around out in the open, and you absolutely should be able to hit giant crits and decimating numbers in PvE if you've built into it..... what you *shouldn't* be able to do is face tank with a damn long to mid range weapon. (Just *my* opinion, take it with a grain of salt before you have an aneurysm)


...but I'm also thinking maybe you just allow *all* the damn weapons to be used from the half-shield....I mean even the WoNY snipers are currently using shields and MMRs, so why not? Having a guy who can pick up and move from behind a shield while belting thousands of rounds from a bullet king to suppress and push NPCs doesn't sound like a bad thing necessarily either.

....it just feels like there half shield skill is in a sort of awkwardly functional but janky spot right now. Just thought I'd throw the idea out here and see what you guys think.",16,1585606336,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fs0hhd/i_think_the_halfshield_in_the_game_needs_a_rework/,thedivision,1

Is it too much to ask to have module names actually reflecting what stat they affect and then be able to sort them in descending quality?

fryuyr,Favure,Massive can you guys please fix how Sticky Bomb and EMP Pulse work with Hard-Wired’s 4pc bonus: Feedback Loop?,"I’m not sure if you guys at Massive are aware of this, and figured I’d try to bring it to attention after reading today’s post on the upcoming patch and not seeing a fix for this in the upcoming fixes. 

**The Problem**:

What happens is, when you go to use either Sticky Bomb variant or the EMP pulse with the 4pc Hardwired gear set bonus, they have a strange interaction with Feedback Loop. Neither Sticky Bomb or EMP pulse will reset the cooldown of your other skill, but strangely enough they will both still proc Feedback Loop. After activating Feedback Loop, EMP pulse will actually reset it’s own cooldown (and not the other skills), and Sticky Bomb will just go on cooldown without resetting it’s own or the other skills cooldown. 

I believe this happens because after using Sticky Bomb or EMP pulse they immediately go on this weird short double cooldown, before going on their actual cooldown (I don’t know how else to describe it), and while it’s on that short cooldown it seems to proc Feedback Loop resulting in what I described above. So what this means is you can’t use Sticky Bomb or EMP pulse to reset the cooldown of your other skill. However, it does work in the opposite manner, as in your other skill(s) can be used to effectively reset the cooldown of these skills, just not the other way around.

&amp;nbsp;

My apologies if this is a known issue, and if it is a known issue I really do hope it is fixed soon, as I am a big fan of EMP pulse and would love to use it with HardWired as intended. I’m not sure if there are any other skills that work in this manner, as these are the only two I’ve come across that function like this, either way I am hoping to see a fix for this soon.",9,1585601026,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fryuyr/massive_can_you_guys_please_fix_how_sticky_bomb/,thedivision,1

I am a returning player on Division 2 and I am kind of lost on what I should do next. I am almost done with the storyline in the new Warlords Expansion Pack, but after that, I don't know what to do next. 

My main concern which I have to debate is on what I should do with all the weapons and gear I've gotten prior to TU8. So I have noticed that the level cap has increased from 30 to 40 and all of my weapons and gear at 30 which makes all the missions a bit more difficult and makes all of my weapons and gear useless. 

So my question is Should I dismantle or sell everything and start all over and get new gear or should I keep all of it? Let me know what you all think?

fry8rt,hersheydood,It feels really shitty to pay to beta test this game.,"There are countless bugs and other issues that simply could have been avoided by actually testing the game. The first day WONY came out, we could see gear sets not working, the first week we could tell NPC's were too overpowered. M1A too strong? Nerf all the rifles!

I feel like the devs simply change lines of code without having anyone sit down and actually see if it all works as intended.

It is like not a single person at Massive actually plays the game. 

Ubisoft has so much money, so many brands/IP's, so many different studios that all share the same greedy overlord who apparently can't hire a single competent tester?

This is literally what testers are for, and what they do. They could have put on the gear sets and told you they didn't work. They could have told you instantly dying to poison or fire isn't fun. They could have told you playing with 4 people seems much harder than it should be. Even a PTS would have shown you the countless errors, miscalculations, or simply broken mechanics that could have been changed beforehand, but no, we were so desperate for ANYTHING new to do, that we all spent that $30 to beta test the expansion. Instead of the 2nd, or even 3rd raid we were supposed to already have, here we are again, waiting for bugs to be fixed.",13,1585599060,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fry8rt/it_feels_really_shitty_to_pay_to_beta_test_this/,thedivision,1

frwpm9,6k6p,Nothing more fun than spending 10 minutes fighting against a group of skill players hiding in a rooftop shooting unlimited gas from their Chem Launcher and insta killing you with fire.,"Jesus Massive, in 4 years after everything we've been through  you still cant find a working balance for PvP. I join a few lobbies and have some fun and as soon as I start enjoying myself too much I get put in a lobby with a bunch of lame ass chem launcher campers shooting you with gas and burning you to death instantly. Doenst matter if you're in cover, behind walls, a mile away, that shit will just insta kill you. After the 3rd time in a row of you not being able to do anything about it, it just drains all the fun out of the game and leaves you feeling empty.

I dont even have words anymore to describe what I feel whenever I have shit like this happen in this game. I am way past the anger, its not rage or even disappointment. At this point it feels like when your mentally disabled child writes on the walls with crayons for the 10th time this week and you are forced to resign to the fact that he just doenst know any better and simply cannot help himself. The moment I get hit with a new bullshit like this in the game I immediately remember that It's Massive and I get overwhelmed by the feeling that I really just cant expect any better from these people anymore. 

I've seen these people work for the past 4 years since day 1 of TD1 and I just have to accept that they just cant. They cant do it. It is beyond their ability to fix the game and make it fun. It will never happen.   The moment they eventually fix what is wrong today they will break something else and it will never stop. I've forced myself to have hope for 4 years because this is one of those games that you can see the huge potential it has, but today I hit rock bottom with this game. I either accept that I will never see this game live up to it's full potential and keep letting this game make me feel dead inside or I simply move on and never look back.",27,1585594401,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frwpm9/nothing_more_fun_than_spending_10_minutes/,thedivision,1

frwes7,ConfuZen,Lesson from manhunt: global difficulty change &amp; control point reset should be seperated in UI.,"The upcoming patch will reset control points when changing global difficulty. Imho, this makes little or no sense:

\- Sometimes (or often) you want to change difficulty without resetting control points (during global events and certain challenges for instance).

\- Sometimes you want to reset control points while retaining current difficulty. After next patch this would require changing the global difficulty twice to accomplish.

\- It's far from intuitive to anyone who does not keep up with patch notes that changing global difficulty is how to resets control points.

After the manhunt debacle you would think it might be, dare i say, apparent that pairing one functionality with an unrelated one is not really a good design choice?",1,1585593445,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frwes7/lesson_from_manhunt_global_difficulty_change/,thedivision,1

frw73g,TuebeeTX,Sheppard Rank Rework,"Yesterday I answered a call to an agent that needed help doing a heroic mission. I was more then happy to help. We ended up beating the mission in about an hour. I did not get endorsed and became I little upset. This mission I would have not done on my own due to that certain Target Loot. But I was here to help anyways. 

My proposal would be this.

Sheppard Rank would be 200 points to next rank. (Unlimited Rank)
Through the ranks this would never change.

Side Activities = 25 points 

Control points = 50 points

Bounties = 50 points

Main Missions = 100 points

Sheppard “On Call” should only alert agents that are in the same World Difficulty as you are playing in. Too many times I would “Answer the call” and would end up playing on Normal or Hard. Which I was not too thrilled about since the loot is pretty much useless to me. 

I think the Sheppard Rank is a cool idea. And it has a lot of potential. But leaving it up to another agent to award you makes little sense to me.

that being said, it has become apparent that attempting CP4’s has become sadistically comical.

yes, this has occurred multiple times to varying degrees and in different order. That said, enjoy what has seemingly become the world that my agent is living in

&amp;#x200B;

Him (fully optimized skill or DPS build) - oh look, a CP4, let’s go save the world...on the way (about 4 blocks from the safe house) I see the following:

\- gang of hyenas roaming with 2 rushers, 1 electronic commander and 1 grenader 

\- adjacent to them....a random heavy laying into severely under-armed civilians 

\- across the street from that is an elite group of black tusks that include (elite war hound with spinning gun), drone commander, a medic and an elite lieutenant.

&amp;#x200B;

please keep in mind this all occurred before I ever even made it the 4 blocks to start the CP4...

once I engaged the CP4, a resource convey approaches and begins an assault, thus forcing me to fight a battle on two fronts. After that an aerial recon is spawned directly over us and begins shooting missiles at me.

after what feels like 40-45 minutes and several deaths later...I take the CP4 only to have 3 rogue agents spawn...

thankfully I got a single drop that I can use (Fox Prayer with 14.8% damage, 15% DofC and I rolled 6% CHC), but DAMN...really?",63,1585590910,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frvll7/the_difficulty_on_heroic_is_almost_comical_at/,thedivision,1

frvh52,Myoxine,System corruption good for pve ?,"Hi agents !

Since i'm going nuts on trying to make builds i wanted to ask some things !

I'm thinking about a pistol dps build and another build focusing on system corruption.

Apparently SC is made for pvp but i'm think about using it with indimidate (or perfect indimidate when i'll be able to get the chest) and mayble bloosucker or something else.

&amp;#x200B;

So the build would focus around getting bonus armor then sustaining the bonus armor for big damages ! (and self-sustain with some amor on kill)

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue when thinkin about this build and his viability in heroics+ is that you have to get 4pcs of SC to get bonus armor.

then 1 golan gear for perfect intimidate (but not mandatory i guess)

So there is room for just 1 Ceska, and that'll be the backpack.

So i don't know if all in all we could manage to have enough CHC and CHD to deal enough damages

Since it's seems suited for an aggressive playstyle i guess using an SMG is a good option, maybe dark winter.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know where to dig with this one so i'm asking here :/

fru7hn,altanglefilms,Goodbye and farewell,"I joined this sub a few months before WONY was released. Like most people starting on a game you look for places online that will offer advice and to keep up-to-date with patch notes etc.

But very quickly I realised that this sub wasn't really that kind of place.

Pretty soon after TU8 things only went downhill further.

I'd love to come on here everyday and see posts about builds players are experimenting with or strategies for missions. But it's just a constant stream of vitriol against the game and the developers. That happens on every sub from time to time. I was there from the start on r/StarWarsBattlefront

And I do share the frustrations about bugs and some odd development choices but I play the game everyday and I really love it. 

But it's out of control here now. And the sad thing is that there probably are helpful posts and probably are users that will help to guide new players etc but it all gets drowned out and downvoted. And it's just terribly sad.

I would urge the moderators to try and address it in some way. Combine it all into one thread. Anything. I don't know the mods - so I hope they don't feel I'm attacking them.

fru363,MemoriesMu,"I dissagree with Reddit at many things, I do love current dificulty. Look what they did on Capitolio Legendary using STEALTH! We still have a lot to learn!","THIS GAME IS AN RPG! Take your time to learn the new mechanics!

I played this game for about only 2 months before NY, so I'm basically a new player. I'm already doing almost any mission solo on heroic (using hybrids), and I only farm on heroic with my clan. People from my clan even farm legendary for the exotic AR (even though they are still learning and testing things, its not easy for them). (Im not saying Im a pro, Im not! I can ONLY do heroic solo with 2 or 3 blues at least, because I suck a bit and I just die when full red. On the other hand, good players can go full red and win heroic just fine)

So many people ENJOYING and loving the game (HATING the bugs and server issues, for sure). Reddit DOES NOT represent the majority of the players, so I'm glad developers are not nerfing this game to hell.

I sound like an asshole saying this, but heroic is not hard at many situations with coordination and good players. And now, some players found ways to do District Union without cheesing the game. They can do it at around 18 minutes. No glitches, no hack, just pure skill.

Firefly blinds everyone, the rest of the team explode the enemies with high damage. Here are 3 videos for proof:

1) [https://youtu.be/Pblz06WBadA](https://youtu.be/Pblz06WBadA)

2) [https://youtu.be/iEq66n\_qpHY](https://youtu.be/iEq66n_qpHY)

3) [https://youtu.be/5MjZBm0USlI](https://youtu.be/5MjZBm0USlI)

However, took me ages to find people doing something like this on Roosevelt and Capitolio, but then I found it! 

\- At \*\*Roosevelt\*\*, they cheese the final boss inside a shelter, but the rest of the mission they can do with pure skill and coordination, at least most of the time. [https://youtu.be/bbLBq11fNZo](https://youtu.be/bbLBq11fNZo)

\- At \*\*Capitolio\*\*, they manage to destroy 2 healing stations at the final boss using \*\*STEALTH\*\*. Yes, STEALTH! That's how developers intended to do this mission. However, after killing the stations, they did cheese inside a shelter though. This does not mean it is impossible to use the arena properly to defeat the enemies. There may be ways to do it, we just have to find it! [https://youtu.be/JO3vW8mmk5c](https://youtu.be/JO3vW8mmk5c)

\- These healing stations are UNIQUE to this boss arena, and they are always at the same place. 

I know using these cheese moves are bad game desing, but we at least can complete these missions, I guess. I do believe this cheese should be removed, to force players to play things in legit ways. I did Union with cheese lol. But Im now trying to do it without using any weird doors or corridors, just like these players did on the videos I said. 

Also, DON'T FORGET Legendary was meant to be played by around 5-10% of the players, according to a developer on State of the Game, so don't expect farming there to be easy.

MANY PEOPLE are loving 2.0, loving the new changes, loving the game, hating the bugs, hating the disconnects, learning new tricks, learning new builds. I'm happy with the current state of the game, I'm happy we need to use a lot of work to do heroics, and let's take more time to learn how to do these legendaries in better ways. I trust these amazing players out there!

We are also working on Title Update 8.5 which is scheduled to be released next week with the exact timing to still be ironed out. TU8.5 is a client update which will allow us to include more fixes and changes that, for example, require an UI change but it also requires a bit more time to be finished and tested. Another update, currently scheduled for later in April, will have some additional changes that are not quite ready. You can find an overview for the changes coming **next week** and what is planned for the end of April in our forum post [here](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2208920-More-updates-on-fixes-and-balance?p=14874936#post14874936).

frrjd0,Trzebiat,You can reset the cooldown of your Reviver Hive by changing loadouts,"Just in case some of you don't know, if your Reviver Hive is on cooldown and you change loadout (out of combat of course) to another one which has different skill equipped and then back to your previous loadout, your Reviver Hive will reset back to full charges (just make sure your other skill is not on cooldown or you won't be able to switch loadouts). Normally the game doesn't allow to change skill when it's on cooldown, even out of combat, but changing loadout allows to bypass that for charge based skills. To not lose specialization ammo make sure to switch between loadouts that use the same specialization.

That way you can have your Reviver Hive (with all charges) ready for every enemy encounter and not be forced to wait for its long cooldown to finish, so you can experience the bug with Reviver Hive not working and failing to pick you up even more often.",25,1585577649,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frrjd0/you_can_reset_the_cooldown_of_your_reviver_hive/,thedivision,1

frrhxd,SteelR013,Suggestion about Heroics and Legendaries,"After a year of playing Heroics, before and after all updates and WONY expansion, one thing was/is/will bother me. Especially when Legendaries jumped in.
Checkpoints.
I never understood the idea of reseting whole progress after a wipe. OK, yes it's punishment, but what do we get if we finish the mission without dying, higher chances for good god rolled drops? Boss(es) will drop some extraordinary loot?
Well, we gain nothing.
Instead of this system, why not do something similar like in the first game?
Remember there's 4 legendaries where Hunter will spawn and you could get guaranteed Exotic drop? Of course that happens only if your team didn't get wiped. On the other hand, if you just want to finish the mission, it would be, maybe not easier, more approachable to get it done.
I mean, take a look at Manning Zoo Stronghold, that mission is really long and it takes some time to finish it and it's annoying to start it from the beginning. And let's be honest, even if you have a proper build and you are good player, mistakes can happen.
So, give us some adequate motivation (reason) to finish missions without wiping. Let's say, in Legendaries you can get guaranteed exotic drop and in Heroics higher chance that Boss will drop some named item or exotic.
Either way, everyone would be satisfied, players who just want to finish the missions on highest difficulty and players who want to test their skill and get the high end loot by doing it.",2,1585577501,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frrhxd/suggestion_about_heroics_and_legendaries/,thedivision,1

frrd4f,rigorousbarley,Improvements to Restorer Hive,"I enjoy the Restorer Hive on my healer build, but it is inferior to the Support Station.

Since Warlords released, we got a glimpse of what it could be capable of with the Support Hive used by the Black Tusk.

I believe the following changes would encompass a lot of what the community has been requesting in addition to a couple of my own ideas:

* Change the hive to AOE so it doesn't need to heal by line-of-sight.
   * This would mean healing around/through cover.
* Add more charges per level of Skill Tier.
   * With my +4 mod, I have 36 charges at Tier 6.
   * Maybe lowering the base charges would counter balance the additional charges as it scales.
   * Something around 50+ at Tier 6 seems reasonable, as you can get 1 second recharge rate in addition to overcharge.
* Add drone speed to the higher levels of Skill Tier (maybe 5 and 6 only?)
   * This would help it have more of a presence in PvP as well while allowing counter play since EMP is powerful and healers are squishy.

I think this would give it more of that Reclaimer feel when paired with high Skill Tier builds.

It already has good range and healing potential if built right.  These would just put it over the top.

frqgbf,TerribleProgress,How are you supposed to enjoy the campaign -- gear-wise?,"People are so overly enthusiastic about the campaigns that I must be missing something. I'm not bashing the game now, it's a genuine question.

When playing the Washington campaign I soon gave up on the idea of making a build. Whenever I was close to getting a 3 (or even 2) piece bonus, the game told me to replace the gear because it was too low level. Why even have gear during the campaign when you cannot use it fully? I was just a chore keeping track of. And a lure of things to come that could not be reached.

By the time I reached level 30 the campaign had been over for some time. Most side missions done with as well. This is when the quest for GS 500 started. This was not much different. I grinded missions and equipped the highest gear score items I could find, and it didn't take long before most gear that dropped were close to GS 500. 

End-game started and I got a lot of gear and made my builds. This is when I would have loved to play the campaign, and all side missions -- with an actual optimized build!

I was double bummed when starting the WONY campaign where my most of my builds had been nerfed and the level cap had been raised.

In games such as Elder Scrolls Online, the trick is not to get the gear, it's to master the mechanics of the dungeons. New expansions doesn't invalidate what you've acomplished or collected, it's giving you new content and challenges. I wish Division 2 would be the same. But judging on how the Recalibration Stations is setup with one section for level 1-30 and another for level 40 items, I suspect the idea is to introduce level 50 with the next expansion.

And when that happens, maybe some of you can tell me how to best enjoy the campaign before re-grinding all gear pieces again.",17,1585573604,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frqgbf/how_are_you_supposed_to_enjoy_the_campaign/,thedivision,1

I'm sure once you have a great build it will speed up running trough challenging or heroic. But I'm not getting there.

frq5ub,MiskatonicProf_1926,How does progression work after level 30? How do you go from level 30 to 31?,"So I'm a returning player who bought the Warlords of NY expansion and created a new character, I've just reached level 30 with this character and completed all Main Missions, Side Missions, Projects and captured all the Control Points. The only thing I have left on the map are a few Contaminated Areas and the 3 Raids (Roosevelt Island, District Union Arena and the Capital Building). I knowthat prior to the new DLC when the level cap was 30 you needed to complete all three of these areas to unlock Specializations and open the World Tier levels but with the Warlords of NY expansion and the increased level cap I have now idea how leveling works after level 30.

Basically I'm sort of stuck at level 30. I've been having a hard time finding groups for missions on ""Story"" difficulty and so far it's been a bust this past weekend finding anyone to play the 3 Raids I need to move into the ""End Game"".

So I have a few questions regarding the ""End Game' now with the new level cap.

First What happens when you beat the Capital Building raid? Does it still unlock the Specializations? 

Second: How does level progression from 30 to 31 work? Once the Capital Building is completed do I start leveling to the new level 40 level cap? 

Which then leads to my final questions: When does World Tier Level begin now? I assume it starts at level 40 but I'm not 100% certain.I think the confusion comes from the ""Level 30 Boost"" that comes with the WoNY expansion.

Since I've been having such a hard time find a group to complete the 3 end game raids to unlock the Specializations I thought about using the Level 30 Boost to just bypass it all together. When I clicked it I got a warning telling me that I would skip all level 1-30 Missions (which at this point I'm pretty sure is just the 3 raids) but it also told me I would skip the ""World Tier 1-5 Journey"". That last bit has me scratching my head. Do I need to grind through the World Tier 1-5 before going to level 31?

Like I said now that I've reached level 30 I feel like I'm stuck in limbo since I can't find a group to play the last 3 missions with (although I could probably do them solo) and I have now idea what actually happens once the Capital Building is completed since the level cap increase. 

I've searched online for information but everything is either pre-WoNY or assumes players have already completed all the main campaign missions and are at WT5. Nothing for new(ish) players hitting level 30 for the first time.",8,1585572453,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frq5ub/how_does_progression_work_after_level_30_how_do/,thedivision,1

frprl3,Myoxine,build suggestion : AR with spotter,"Hello !

I wanted to share a build i'm using lately !

It's not really innovative but i like it and i'm having really nice results in heroics !

&amp;#x200B;

It's a classic CHC and CHD but combined with spotter talent:

&amp;#x200B;

3pcs **providence** mask/ holster/ gloves rolled with Weapon damage, CHC,CHD and HSD (because i only have this right now but maybe another attribute could be better).

1pc **grupo** on the kneepdads rolled with Weapon damage, CHC andCHD 

1pc **fenrir** on the backpack rolled with Weapon damage, CHC,CHD and with bloodsucker (not sure about this one as well).

1pc **ceska** on the chest rolled with Weapon damage, CHC,CHD and with spotter talent.

And i use the Technician for the technician mainly for the pulse attachement and the skill tier is neat when i'm using the crusader shield for extra survivability.

concerning weapons i use an ACR-E (with the pulse laser, CHC optics, CHD muzzle and extended mag)

because this is my best AR right now (altough i'm having good result with a M4 police too) and i'm using fast hands for nice sustained damage !

As my secondary weapon i'm using dark winter because it as a nice burst.

and for the sidearm i don't have any preferences.

Why spotter you could ask ?

Well because i just like the overall talent and find it funny to use and i like trying things a bit off-meta or not really popular !

I'm sitting actually at 55.6% CHC and 95% CHD but i'm far from having max rolls on my gear or having everything i want too. \^\^'

Actually i tried to do this build kind of on my own, i read that providence is really good and i tried to fill with gears that seemed to synergize well.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time i present a build so feel free to ask me if i forgot something or else !

frm4xv,elberto83,Core attributes and the problem with random rolls,"**Warning:**

Wall of text incoming, TL:DR at the bottom of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

When TU8 started, most of us were leveling and shooting our way through New York. And during that time, many of you, just like me, have probably started to fill our Recalibration Library. And there's something odd that you may not have noticed right away. When it comes to the Core Attributes, one of those is not like the others. Can you guess which one? I'll give you a hint: How many times have you extracted Weapon Damage or Armor from a piece of gear, just to get closer to the maximum? And how many times did you do that with Skill Tier? Exactly. Once per slot.

&amp;#x200B;

# The inequality of core attributes

Skill Tier is, from an optimization perspective, the BEST of the three core attributes. The reason for this is simple: it has no minimum value. While Weapon Damage and Armor can vary from terribly low to acceptable or even perfect, Skill Tier can not. It has no random values.

Set items ""suffer"" from a similar problem: They have only two attributes (including the core attribute), therefore it's easier to find a well rolled one.

The Hardwired set is the pinnacle of this inequality between core and random attributes. Since those pieces have only one random attribute, it's practially impossible to get a ""bad"" one. You can just recalibrate the random attribute and BOOM. God roll.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with the current gear system is not randomness in itself. It is the ""amount of randomness"", the total number of random attributes. Let's have a look at the following example:

* Item 1 is a holster with 7% Weapon Damage, 12% Critical Hit Damage and 3% Critical Hit chance. 2 low attributes, 1 maxed. You'll probably end up dismantling or selling it.
* Item 2 is a holster with Skill Tier, 17% Repair skill and... Health. You can recalibrate the latter to skill haste and use it for a healer build. It may not be perfect, but close enough to last for a while.

The result of this is that it's actually easier to create good Skill Tier based gear pieces. The core attribute is already maxed, you only need one random attribute that fits your desired build. It doesn't even have to be maxed, just high enough.

At the same time, getting good pieces with Armor/Weapon Damage is actually more difficult, since all three attributes depend on luck, and all of this doesn't even take the color of random attributes into account.

&amp;#x200B;

# Proposals for a solution

I see two possible ways of solving this problem: even the odds or reducing the variance.

**Even the odds:**

\- Add bars for Armor and Weapon Damage similar to the already existing one for Skill Tier.

\- Have each point of those core attributes provide a fixed value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reducing the variance:**

\- Increase the minimum value for Armor and Weapon Damage, e.g. to 10% for Weapon Damage

\- This would result in a higher average value, making it easier to focus on the other two attributes to get a usable piece of gear.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the first solution might be the obvious choice, I personally would prefer the second one. The reason is simple: It would still allow room for optimization. There could still be a better item, allowing you to squeeze just a tiny bit more dps out of your build, you just haven't found it yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading.

# TL:DR

* Skill Tier is, from an optimization perspective, the best core attribute
* Weapon Damage and Armor suffer from their high variance between minimum and maximum, therefore making it more difficult to find good gear pieces

frm4lf,ceciladams85,Damage to Armor and Damage to Targets Out of Cover should not be on brand sets that increase damage to a specific weapon type,"It's enough that ARs feel much weaker than all other weapons right now, but to make a good DPS build I have to use these two named items because they give multiplicative damage boosting which is essential once you reach +120% weapon damage on a certain weapon type, so making those strictly to Rifles' and LMGs' brand sets (Overlord and Petrov) just limits damage options when it comes to weapons if I want to be as helpful to myself or my team as I can. Damage-focused gear sets will especially get affected by this as the 4 pieces will have to increase the weapon damage of the weapon I want to use or I'll just be using either LMGs or Rifles which btw are not the best for a Striker for example.",5,1585552043,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frm4lf/damage_to_armor_and_damage_to_targets_out_of/,thedivision,1

frl2dc,Blinkk8704,Content Cop - Massive Entertaintment,"1. Warlords Of maintenance: 

Expansion not even working on day 1

- players not being able to interact with NPCs in respective safe houses to progress the story. I can safely say literally half the playerbase or perhaps even more had to deal with this bug, we paid for the expansion and cannot even progress the story on day 1? How did such a huge bug make it through testing? 
- Many players also dealt with Delta errors not allowing them to progress into the character selection screen, I had 3 other friends waiting to play the expansion and I was the only one able to make it through only to be stopped by the NPC bug. Maintenance fix was only issued the next day. 

2. NPCs :

""Oh this is a cover shooter you should be in cover, just optimise your build, its only the first few weeks of the expansion you should fully optimise your build before trying harder difficulties."" 

- Bullet sponge enemies
- Insane NPC damage
- Insane group scalings
- The moment you get the fire status effect your just dead. There is no counterplay, Fire stuns you for the first few moments you wont even have the time to heal or refresh your armor. Why does fire continue to damage you even in the downed state? 
- Terminator AI (you know what im talking about)
- Supressed enemies still have insane accuracy. 
- Actually olympians being able to jump out of your grenades and seekers everytime. Im also talking about red bar enemies. 
- God tier marksmanship, being able to fully ignore damage range and one shot you from a mile away.
- Flamethrower enemies seemingly having infinite range and shoot through walls with their flamethrowers, especially the tanks that can take hundreds of rounds to actually kill and somehow able to run straight at you with all that armor.

3. Higher difficulties:

- Drone operators constantly spam suicide drones like its nothing while in cover.
- Grenadiers have unlimited explosives and just spam them at you.
Look up any video of people doing Legendary, its only done by cheesing the missions, getting constantly one shotted the moment you pop your head out, and taking hours to complete only to get dogshit loot for all that effort. I honestly don't think legendary is meant to be played this way. ""Sure of course solo players can do Legendary solo with a decent build and maybe even speedrun"" thats a complete lie by the devs. Did Massive test the NPCs in higher difficulty? How did they think its okay to get one shotted, once you get a DOT your instantly dead, tanks and drones taking loads of magazines to kill. And before you say getting one shotted by NPCs are an overstatement, there are many times i got killed and it displayed i was hit by 1.4 - 3 million damage in 1 to 3 hits by the enemy before going down. 

4. ""Build Diversity""

Its simply does not exist, are hybrid builds ever going to come back ? Yes i agree legendaries are only done by having one of each role in the team but most people are running the basic full reds contractor gloves fox prayer glass cannon build. Although massive did a great job adding the recalibration library, I however actually hated how gears work with everything being oversimplified just to cater to new players. 

- Go full tank, still get shredded in PVP and PVE
- Go full skill build, only viable for support role. Does jack shit in pvp.
- Skills such as striker drones and turrets also get one shotted by NPCs

5. Loot

""We want loot to feel special and rewarding"" Its completely dogshit everywhere. I was grinding level 4 control points and still getting purples and very low rolled items from NPC drops and crates after completing them.
- Loot from challenging and heroic have absolutely no difference, they rarely dropped anything decent and don't feel rewarding. 
- Mods are dropping constantly, why are skill mods so useless again?
- Enemies are dropping so much lesser loot but still seem to always drop stuff outside of loot allocation?
- Why was the daily SHD requisition project removed? Why are we forced to farm level 3-4 control points just to get blueprints? There are hundreds of them in the game with no clear way of actually getting the specific one you want. I personally gotten every blueprint possibly before WONY dropped and so why is Massive screwing over the people that have not?

6.Exotics

- Why are exotics called ""exotics"" when regular weapons outperform them in every way?
- Holstered talents from exotics was not ""confusing"" in any way, why were they removed?
- Why do exotics always come in random rolls as if they are not rare enough already? 
- Why cant exotics be recalibrated when they have such dogshit rolls? 
- Does anybody actually even use exotic weapons anymore? I do however, think that exotic armor are somewhat in the right place.

7. Bugs

- Every single control point in New York still has not resetted since launch of expansion. We paid for it and its still not a priority? Whats the point of me buying the expansion only for the New York map to not offer me much activities to do? Its okay they said they are ""working on it""
- Revive hive and reviving players still bugged since expansion, ruined so many of my heroic and legendary runs because i could not revive myself and teammates. ""We are aware and working on it""
- Armor sets still bugged, Hard Wired only partially fixed, Striker set hit registration and stacking bugged, Tip Of The Spear still being exploited in dark zone to get specialist ammo. ""We are aware of this""
- NPCs stuck in walls during missions and bounties still not fixed, this issue was addressed way before the expansion went live, there are so many times I had to restart the mission and bounty. ""We are working on it""
- DPS glitch that actually benefited the players immediately gets fixed and put on the highest priority. Whats funny? 4 maintenances to fully fix it what a joke. If Massive was worried about this being abused in PVP why cant they just make you reset everytime you enter the dark zone? Oh abused in PVE? To get dogshit loot in higher difficulties? If players actually feel ""fun"" only while doing the glitch and feel the NPC scalings are bearable because of it, there is something very wrong with the game. ""We will look into possibly punishing players after we actually fix the bug"" Yes please do punish the 50% of your playerbase for your own mistakes of not properly testing and fixing your own game. 
- Nerfing rifles as a whole because Classic M1A and Bakers Dozen is overused? What is the logic in that? Its clear the weapon itself is the issue but why nerf the entire class of weapons? As if rifles aren't even used enough this just hits the nail in the coffin. 
- What is the point of nerfing NPCs damage by 20% when they one shot you? How is that gonna fix anything? 
- People complain about bullet sponges and solo difficulty: Massive proceeds to increase armor and health to enemies for solo players. Where is the logic in that?

8. Conclusion
Massive please do not give the excuse of the current situation to not fix the game as you are all working from home. You had plenty of time while working on the expansion to fix and test the game but somehow we are now your beta testers? Do you pay us to test your games? Do we actually work for you now? Why are we inclined to screenshot and record the bugs and send it to Massive in hopes of it getting fixed because they take forever to actually fix anything.(except the dps glitch of course thats reeeaaaaaallyyyy important) All these bugs were present and reported on constantly even before they started working from home but no they seem to have other priorities? DPS glitch : ""UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE INCOMING IN 30 MINUTES"" other more game breaking bugs: ""We are aware and are working on it"" oh by the way since the start of the expansion. Massive also has this somewhat deep rooted hatred for solo players making the game especially difficult for them. Will Massive learn from their mistakes in the past and actually fix the issues that are affecting players the most? Is it so hard to actually have a PTS for players to test the game like so many other games have done. I really want Massive to live stream playing Legendary difficulty with a fully optimised build, this has been brought up many times but they just always dodge the question.
Am i being too negative at the game? Yes because I actually love this game and don't want the devs to mess up next expansion.

frk9bp,wiserone29,The number of defensive mods should be greatly reduced.,"We need the following defensive mods. 

Hazard protection:

ALL hazard protection. Having a different protection mod for the different hazards is absurd. Who is gonna go through the trouble of sorting all this crap and wearing the right hazard for a given situation?

Explosive resistance:

In tank builds, explosion resistance is pretty good. 

Armor on kill:

This should be BUFFED a lot and changed to a percentage of your armor. Like a god rolled piece can have giving someone 10%. With 2M armor and three god rolled armor on kill mods you would get 600k armor. This isn’t OP because if you have 2M armor you are running 6 blues and don’t have a ton of DPS to actually kill anything often. 

Repair skills:

I personally don’t see the utility here but someone might and it’s the same range of skill mods so why not?

That’s it. There is no need to have the rest. It’s a pain in the ass to manage and it adds a relatively trivial buff between mid range and god rolled mods.",26,1585542682,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frk9bp/the_number_of_defensive_mods_should_be_greatly/,thedivision,1

How many time you are shooting and then the tank just crawls in front of your sights and slowly moves forward blocking all your bullets?? Consider that the dps guy is behind cover and it will take him a while to find another suitable cover to shoot as more. 

You must always come to the enemy at a slight angular route leaving the way for your dps to shoot at the enemy especially in confined maps. 

If you’re in a corridor you need to either lean left or right, do not stay in the center!! 

Also you do not always need to deploy your shield as soon as the fight starts when you are way back and far from the enemy , how about some strategic positioning first (light flank close to the enemy) before deploying?

frhgtk,Bluryth,"TD2 Objective Randomizer - A 'Division 2 Bingo' Minigame created for Normal &amp; Hardcore characters, solo players &amp; groups of all skill levels - Over 350 different Activities/Restrictions/Goals!","Hi Reddit!

I've created a little minigame which I wanted to share with you guys. It is similar to a bingo card - you randomly pick out a few (1-10 from each column) different activities/goals/restrictions for your new character from lengthy columns and work towards them until you achieve them all.

**TD2 Objective Randomizer - What is it?**

Originally, I made it as a means to **randomize and spice up levels 1-40** a little and to give my Hardcore Agents more, and more-achieveable **end game goals**, but I've since shuffled things around and tried to balance the sheet so that regular agents and agents of all skill levels can join in on the fun!

I've tried to create a balanced list full of early game as well as late/end game activities - some of them you'll get through easily. Others will have to wait! **There's 350+ items to randomly choose from**, with more stuff being added as I go along and get new ideas.

[A variety of columns full of different activities and restrictions to randomly pick from - Anything from 'No SMGs' and 'No Quartermaster Perks' to 'Complete Grand Washington Hotel on Heroic' and much more!](https://preview.redd.it/8357ya01fpp41.png?width=1896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed1b99e3d2862df59a86aff26c437bbffcffbed)

**How does it work? Step by step**

1. Visit the Spreadsheet I created here: [Link to spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7l36jJeFrnR46F4VyGOMWlQnAxp8PqlfQ41pXXducA/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Click [THIS LINK](https://approsto.com/random-line-picker/) to go to a 'random line picker' - (Alternatively, use your preferred random line picker)
3. Copy Row A, from 'Only SMGs' down to 'Rifle &amp; Marksman Rifle Only' and paste it into the random line picker
4. For 'Number of lines to pick', we use the number listed in the header above the column. For Row A, it's 1. (You can change those numbers around to customize your difficulty and/or amount of restrictions and goals to achieve)
5. Save the picked line(s) in a notepad or make a checklist. (Notepad or Google Sheets works, use Excel if you want to colour in boxes that are done)
6. Repeat the same steps for every column, save your results and start working towards your goals!

For those who manage to clear a whole list - I'd personally hand you an Exotic Cache if I could!

&amp;#x200B;

[Paste each column into the Random Line Picker, choose the number of lines to pick and find out what your new goals and objectives are](https://preview.redd.it/pfj7cdgulpp41.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49b341d63a8c82b20d1809e46b969ca9719ab393)

**Final words**

I tried to balance the lists the best I could. That being said - every player is different. Everyone has a different definition of what's difficult/fun and what isn't. If you find some of these annoying, too difficult or too time consuming, feel free to reroll or remove them from the list that you copied. The most important thing is having fun with it!

The numbers above the columns are mostly just my personal preference, feel free to play around with the numbers to customize it for yourself.  Also, feel free to skip any columns that look too difficult!

Copying and pasting it into a random line picker isn't ideal, I know - if there's enough interest, I'll look into throwing it up on a proper website or something along those lines. Let me know what you think and if you're going to give it a shot. It's extremely fun, especially when you love the gameplay loop but aren't sure what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Put the time in the main screen!!! I mean seriously?? You can put it under the skills or whatever, its dumb that we need to go to photo mode to check the in-game time.
2. Lets us sort gear, weapons, gear mods, skill mods basically everything by ATTRIBUTES!!!!!! its super annoying to sort thought items, mods, etc...
3. Lets us put whatever skill mod we want into whatever slot we want, just restrict some of them for balancing purposes so we dont have to be hoarding all these duplicated mods for different slots.

frh100,Dysentz,"For Heroic/Legendary, 6yellow CC &gt;&gt; 6blue Tank for damage mitigation. Let's buff tanks!","Every single run I do of heroic or legendary, I find that groups just plain run better without someone wearing a pile of blue cores. Once I finished up a well-rolled status set (status/haste on every piece + a dragon holster), I found it was just much more effective than 6blue tanking for all content hard enough to require a nondps role.

My experiences (I've done all 3 legendaries, all heroics multidirective using a variety of roles - 6red, 6blue, 6yellow):

* Defensive (blue) abilities and talents mitigate static amounts that don't scale well vs enemy damage (except True Patriot, but that means giving up set bonuses and armor slots and it still takes time to apply to the enemies). Enemy damage is so high that granting 1.8M tardi shields or 1M galvanize shields to the group only really stops one hit, and doesn't prevent debuffs (like staggers or fire/bleed/etc).

* On that tip, Defensive abilities don't prevent staggers or status effects to your groupmates. These are the mission enders... every single enemy skill headed to the group can lead to a wipe if it hits anyone but the tank. Stunning or EMP'ing multiple enemies out of throwing a skill/grenade just eliminates the chance of that happening, whereas tanking all those hits requires positioning and coordination between tank and healer and dps. 

* Stunning an enemy makes them stop being evasive and lets DPS maximize output. The difference between a DPS player piling damage into a stunned enemy out of cover and them trading shots with an active one behind cover is huge. Tanks aren't nearly able to push enemies into bad positions in the same way because a tank typically can't just walk up and flank an enemy position until most of the enemies are already dead... even with a bulwark out, you take too much damage doing this.  

In Heroic, the difference between 6blue and 6yellow for mitigation isn't so big -- often a tank can be just fine as long as the group is smart about positioning. That's the difference tho - a good CC/status build doesn't need careful positioning.  CC'ing all the enemies makes it so tunnel vision dps randos with bad positioning can just 12x scope the golds with their M1A's from the middle of the battlefield and not die. A Tardigrade might save them from the first hit, but they're still gonna get killed seconds later trying to reposition. Stunning their target lets them just tunnelvision that damage downrange without a care.

I'd really like to see Blue builds have more resources to prevent the things that actually wipe a group and do a better job of flushing enemies out of cover. Good changes for Tanking would be:

1. More Blue-core-benefiting skills (like shield -- it's awesome that 6blue gets tier 6 shield). Something to mitigate status effects / staggers to the group or flush enemies out of cover without fully CC'ing them. Making Decoy get blue effects too would be pretty cool - that's an underused skill that can hold threat and has tanky HP. Defender drone skill tiers would be another cool one to give to tanks that would let them help the group's dps survive. Esp if you granted tier 5/6 defender drones stagger absorption.

2. Need better scaling for shields and bonus armor vs enemy damage. Tanks can't really stand up to heroic+ damage in a meaningful way, so they're still bound to be careful with positioning. Makes it hard to really flank enemies or y'know, _tank_. Blue cores should be more like 350k armor than 170k so that tanks were actual tanky vs endgame content and dps actually considered a blue core.

3. Better ability to get/hold aggro from enemies. Give a tier 6 shield an even better aggro component and allow us visibility into which mods/weapons improve our aggro. Push enemies to actually shoot bulwark or deflector instead of ignoring it.

4. Some way to mark enemies to improve group damage to them. True Patriot is good for this, but other options would be cool. I used to run pistol/shield sentry back in Div1 1.05 for legendaries and that was really awesome for telling the group what to target and kill.

5. Give one spec a blue core effect (that also improves shield) the way technician gets a yellow core and several specs get the equivalent of 15% WD/ an extra red core. Firewall would be a good place for this, since it's the only spec that grants a shield skill.",21,1585529266,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frh100/for_heroiclegendary_6yellow_cc_6blue_tank_for/,thedivision,2

frgpmw,Thewtfpanda,Removing weapon damage from the game would solve a lot of balancing issues.,"Really been thinking about all the balancing issues this game has and this is what it boils down to, having the ability to double a weapons damage from stat increases is killing balancing and build diversity. If it was removed and red was retooled to focus on critical hits and other weapon stats that make weapons perform better but not drastically increase damage would open the game up tremendously. Of course the NPCs would also have to be rebalanced and I'm not saying remove talents that add conditional weapon damage just armor.  From a design standpoint I believe this is what is causing the biggest issues. This would open up skill, support, and tank builds, allowing them to compete at a similar level as all red builds. It would also make it easier for them to balance all weapons across the board. Instead we have clear best in slot weapons that the community migrates towards.  Thought?

frgf8b,black_maps,My HYBRID solo build that is actually pretty fun to play.,"I’ve been playing around with different hybrid builds since TU8, trying to see if I could make something work and really nothing has been useful or fun until my latest iteration. For the most part you really can’t not spec into one thing or you just feel really weak or vulnerable but this build addressed most of those problems.


The idea is a tank status effect build that can still put out good damage. I am running survivor specialization for the 10% bonus damage to status effected and the mender seeker. You want to stack headshot damage as much as you can where possible.

Weapons:
Pestilence, Baker’s Dozen, M1911 with breadbasket and 10% headshot damage as the bonus stat (this is pretty important)

I have been on the look out for a god-roll Mozambique because that is my perfect gun for this but it still eludes me. I tried to make liberty work but it really just has too low a rate of fire and it’s recoil is really unpredictable and not very easy to control. M1911 is in my opinion the best here if you don’t have a decent mozambique. 



Mask: D and H with weapon damage main,  head shot damage and hazard protection, headshot damage in the modslot.

Chest: Gila with TRAUMA as the talent. Max armor and headshot damage, ideally you would re-roll the mod slot to red for headshot damage mod but that isn’t always possible.

Holster: Imperial dynasty exotic holster. My roll sucks but honestly it doesn’t matter all that much the talent is the part you want. Status effects and hazard protection in the attributes.

I have been trying to find a Claws Out holster because that would probably be good as well and maybe better. it gives additional pistol damage, 200% melee damage for shield bashing. But the fire talent on imperial will always be more fun.

Backpack: Gila with Protector as the talent. You can’t go wrong with protector is gives you near constant bonus armor. You could go for a damage talent here, which I may try but it’s riskier. If you do that you might think about running a reviver hive just in case.

Gloves: Contractor’s Gloves (named Petrov gloves) these are nasty, and another way to increase damage without losing a main stat, mine are rolled for damage but you could switch them to armor to be precautious. The special talent on these is 11% damage to armor in the secondary slot. This not only helps when you are using the pestilence but it also applies to your pistol and rifle. It’s basically 11% more weapon damage.

Knees: Fox’s Prayer (Named Overlord kneepads). Again these have a special secondary talent that give 15% damage to targets out of cover, this applies to all your weapons. Additionally it gives +10% rifle damage for when you are using your rifle.

Pistols already have a pretty high headshot multiplier so stacking headshot damage in slots it’s easy to get to 1 million headshot damage when breadbasket profs. Which is all the time.

Between Trauma on the chest and the fire from the holster pretty much any enemy you are currently rly engaging with will be hit with a status effect if not multiple. This procs at the very least every 30 seconds but it feels like it’s pretty constant between all the talents working independently and having different cool downs.





It’s not really great for groups as it doesn’t contribute to supporting the group enough, but I sometimes run it and switch out the chest for tardigrade and it does pretty good up to heroic if you’re careful and making sure not to get flanked.

There is definitely room for improvement and tweaking. I’d like to try it with an ongoing directive set and see how that is. You would still want to run Trauma though for more stays effects. You would also have to re-roll all of your main stats to armor which would prevent you from changing any secondary attributes, so you would need to be lucky enough to find some pieces with already good attributes.

Thoughts? Anybody else running a hybrid that is working for them or fun?? Sorry for the long lost I am on mobile so I hope the formatting isn’t too annoying for y’all.",10,1585527058,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frgf8b/my_hybrid_solo_build_that_is_actually_pretty_fun/,thedivision,5

I played the hell out of The Division 1 years ago and recently a friend of mine convinced me to buy the second part. I haven't been able to do so a year ago when the game came out because of financial struggles to say the least.

frfpjv,AikijinX,Tamper Proof Talent Does NOT work in DZ (BUG) or No?,"TL;DR- Your game is broken, skills don’t work, we are an inferior faction, no build diversity, Status Effect is GARBAGE, Talent Placement makes 0 sense (like an example steady handed on a boom stick sidearm)

With all these threads talking about weapon damage and how sub tier they were, I decided to go the route of status effect.

My initial reaction was: WHY THE HELL is Wicked and Creeping death on the same gear tab (Exclusive only to Backpacks) ? Why are we not able to create synergy with our builds, that say.. an armor stacking build or glass cannon type physical builds can. I had wanted to make an Imperial Dynasty creeping death burn build. (Imperial Death)&amp;amp;lt;- I Dub it my build name 😂LOL.

Then I tried my best to try and see if I could work in Trauma, with Imperial Dynasty and Creeping Death. I liked the synergy but my (Imperial Death build) would pretty much prioritize Imperial Dynasty all the time, so the sharing of Blind and Bleed via Trauma definitely wasn’t optimal going on CD every 60secs just for 1 target. Paired with a Pestilence on one LMG and vindictive or perpetuation on another which I tested. It just felt lackluster because I couldn’t have Wicked on my Chest.

Then I went the route of Tamper Proof:

Number 1: The activation distance (3m) is TERRIBLE. This needs a BUFF. At least 8m distance. 

Number 2: The activation (Arm time) is way too LONG.  5 seconds, I suggest 2.5 secs.

Number 3: Does NOT activate at ALL in The Darkzone. 

Number 4: The Shock status from the talent does NOT benefit from status effect duration boosts. I tried using ongoing directive to try and see if I could boost it that way, but it remains and maintains only 5sec shock duration every 10s.

I had wanted to make a multi status- multi layered build revolving around The CC of status effects. But status effects in general are not in a great state. Number 1: Our status effects vs. any RED light zone mob in general is laughable. Our status is effect just isn’t comparable, but we are Division Agents right? We are supposed to be: “The Best”

frdyxr,saagri,Beating Challenging Federal Emergency Bunker League Time Trial with a Skill Build,"I wanted to see if I could beat the time trial with a skill build. I managed to do it with just a few seconds to spare. 

Here is the video of the run: https://youtu.be/hx1D9TZs4Lw

Mission results: https://youtu.be/hx1D9TZs4Lw?t=857

Build: https://youtu.be/hx1D9TZs4Lw?t=866

I had 4 piece HW with skill damage rolls. Chest was wyvern and had calculated. Backpack had perfect tech support.

I had calculated on the backpack because it can store the activation. So if the drone/turret got kills, the talent would be saved up for when it was destroyed, it would immediately come off of CD.  It came in handy in the beginning to allow me to reposition the turret at the spawn point. And since the skills were doing most of the killing, tech support made sense. 

The Striker Drone and Assault Turret were used because they don't require much interaction on my part. The drone is useful to smoke out enemies while the turret helps defend my position and dishes out damage. It seems like with this mission and difficulty the enemies couldn't kill them fast enough so they had good uptime. 

Lady Death gave the skills a damage boost. I also wiggled around in cover to make sure I had full stacks for when I needed to shoot something. 

Unfortunately this particular setup would lose a lot of effectiveness if there were more elite enemies with guns. The skills would have been getting killed a lot.",8,1585518263,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frdyxr/beating_challenging_federal_emergency_bunker/,thedivision,0

frdugn,joconja,Rogue Respawn Suggestion,"I know there is more pressing stuff to right now.. but I wanted to make a suggestion for the rogue-respawn mechanics in the dz. I somehow have a little hope left that someday there is time for something like this.

First of all: I like the shorter cooldown when you die. Infact I wouldn't mind if it would be gone at all. Don't really see the point.

The rogue-status sync should not be immediat. Especially with the above mentioned shorter cooldown. This often leads to an annoying shooting-in-the-back right outside the checkpoint cycle. It's annoying for the rogue who gets out and gets immedialty killed again and it's annoying for non-rogues to get killed by a respawed agent.

So my suggestion would be: a killed rogue will not become rogue automatically after respawning. There has to be some kind of interaction with another rogue of the group. It could be as simple as re-falgging in the very close proximity or an actual interaction between two agents (like a revive).

This would not only solve the problem I described earlier.. but would also prevent the possibility of fast traveling across the map to keep the rogue/manhunt status alive andeventually clear a manhunt without contact to the rest of the group.",0,1585517825,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frdugn/rogue_respawn_suggestion/,thedivision,1

frdska,skyghost75,Fix Federal Emergency Bunker,"Rant.  Ok, the devs want us to play this map on a time trial but I've been in so many instances where either:


a) Enemies get stuck inside walls or spawn doors and can't be killed to allow the mission to progress.  Have to waste minutes shooing gas/fire grenades in hope to kill them inside the wall.


b) Room where we contact the surviving agent has a 2nd floor where enemies hide from players.  Sometimes they won't come up to the window/railing to be killed so the mission can't progress.  Recently we wasted 3 minutes tossing seeker mines trying to kill them while they kept running away even further back into the room.


3) The ""burning room"" pipes won't release water when shot so the mission can't progress.  And it's completely random which pipe won't work.  We had to kill ourselves with our own grenades to restart.  Minutes wasted again.

1.5. What are the best rolls I can get? Examples what’s the highest +% weapon damage and armor piece can drop with? What’s the highest skill regen? 


2. Crafting: pretty sure it’s as simple as get the recipe, get material and craft, but wanted to double check there wasnt anything more to it.


3. Missions/Difficulty: what difficultly do people usually do missions on? What difficulties should I be able to solo? 


3.5. Best place to find people to play with? The premission matchmaking seems to never work. Do people not play?


4. Anything else I need to know about endgame?

frdmhq,waktivist,"Now that we have Directives, how about adding a complementary set of Appropriations that we can turn on to gain ease and quality of gameplay buffs, in exchange for a stacking XP penalty.","Regardless of whether you think the gameplay tuning right now is just fine, or completely out of wack, one thing I think that everyone can agree on is that some people are totally happy with the state of the game and others totally are not.

Straight up bugs and unintended effects aside, and even assuming it is likely that some additional tuning still is going to be done on some enemies and mechanics, it seems like there is an opportunity here to use the new Directive-style global aura mechanic to let players have more choice about how tryhard they want to be with the game at any given time.

So, just spitballing here, but maybe Appropriations could be things like:

* **Nanite Bio-Barrier.** Damage and duration of hostile status effects are reduced by 90%.
* **Kinetic Reactive Body Armor.** Ballistic and explosive damage you receive is reduced by 50%.
* **Nanite Med-Pack.** Restore 3% per second of your total health and armor while in cover and not receiving damage. Regeneration triggers after 5 seconds in cover without taking damage.
* **ISAC Assisted Target Designator.** Enemies you damage with weapons, skills, or explosives are pulsed until combat ends. Pulsed enemies take 50% additional damage from all sources.
* **Ammo Scrounger.** Critical hits and headshots have a 100% chance to return the round to your magazine, and the amount, effect, and duration of all special ammo that you pick up are doubled.

For obvious reasons, these bonuses should never be available in the DZ. Also they only should be available to turn on for Normal through Heroic global difficulties, and not available at all for Legendary. They also should be mutually exclusive with Directives, so you could turn on either Appropriations or Directives, but not a mix of both.

The XP penalty could be something like minus 10% for each Appropriation that is turned on, down to a 50% discount with all five. For Story mode only, maybe have them all turned on by default, with no XP penalty, but still able to be turned off if you prefer.

Loot quality also could be discounted, if needed to give those who already are SHD 800+ and seasonal rank 100 a reason not to just run with all Appropriations on all the time when farming gear.

Setting aside that the consensus seems to be that loot drops across the board are too stingy to justify the time and effort of higher difficulties right now, but assuming they eventually get to some baseline for scaling drop quality that makes sense, then they also could add a discount on drop quality and exotic drop rate such that running Heroic with all Appropriations on would downgrade the drops to average the same as Challenging; Challenging with all five would be the same as Hard, etc.",2,1585517049,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frdmhq/now_that_we_have_directives_how_about_adding_a/,thedivision,1

frd05i,RhezzVa,Ongoing Directive - Suggestion for Massive,"OD is really underperforming right now as in PVE as in PVP.

Main issues are:

\- Low bleed DMG (even with fully stacked Status Effects) thicks are going to \~50k, which over 10s gives about 1.2M dmg which is laugably low for even red mobs on heroic and for tanky players (PVP modifier literally makes it dog shit).

\- Ammo is gained only by killing status effected enemies, this does not take into account players so it's not usable at all in Conflict. Also it doesn't drop if enemy is killed by our own bleed.

\- After a kill with this requirement u get 30 special ammo to the weapon that you are currently reloading, in case of fast clips like SMG and AR it's only 20% dmg buff for the clip - if u not succed to kill someone affected by status in that limit u fall back in dmg very hard. If u sprey on multiple enemies u don't deal significant damage and you can't kill 1 enemy to get ammo back.

\- 30 Ammo, most of the people use +mag size on weapons which causes to loss of dmg for the end of the clip.

You can work around these thing in DZ but its still too far for somewhat okay performance. In comparison to pure Pestilence tanks, gear sets and talents utilized by tanks etc.

Possible solution:

\- higher base bleed dmg or higher % gained from stacking status effects otherwise mayby some small % of damage gained from stacking weapon damage (with high base, status effect tanks would be too OP),

\- gaining special ammo from players (even if it'd be like 50% after kill).

\- higher base damage of hollow point bullets or continious hits strenghtening and refreshing the bleed or something like after hitting bleeding enemy 20 times gaining addictional hollow points to next reload.

\- to balance PVP and PVE use a modifier taking into account dmg after getting high status effect, wicked, and weapon talent (sadist) or the other way around just make bleed dmg being multiplied onenemy NPCs.

&amp;#x200B;

With this occasion please also take a look at Striker, it has skill requirements but we gain very little from it. It's easy to get same bonus weapon damage from other talents. It'd be nice if it could at least give some armor repair for survivability like in Div1 (like repair 2% armor for headshots after getting 25 stacks).",22,1585514871,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frd05i/ongoing_directive_suggestion_for_massive/,thedivision,4

frbo1v,FatBubba_tm,FatBubba's take on TU8 one-shot sniper build,"Hi all, just wanted to share my take on the one-shot sniper build. 

So, let me preface this by stating, I'm not the best pvp'er... Wait that's a bad assumption. I'm barely an okay pvp'er. I made this build because it's something I like, it's not world changing/meta changing. On that note I can't really answer questions because it's not put together with science it's just how it feels.

This build is for: 

* Organized PvP or PvE, but not really Dark-Zone. I would only take this into the Dark-Zone if you had a team that was willing to work around you as you and highly organized. Also I would limit teams to 1 of these builds in a group. This is not a Solo DZ build, unless you okay with losing for fun or the challenge.
* Those who can take a loss without their online ego being hurt.
* Those who want hard to play, but highly rewarding play style.
* Adrenaline junkies.

Pros: 

* Fun to play...
* Adrenaline Junkie fix...

Cons: 

* Status effects. A single hit on you can tick hard, you are wearing Perfect glass cannon.
* Enemy teams that roll together and your team is looking at the pretty flowers.

**This build focuses on crit damage and and not so much head shot damage**. The reason for this is a critical hit always counts where as head shot well you have to hit them in the head. I don't like relying on only head shots, in this kind of game. The idea is if I crit and hit you in the shoulder, it's going to make you panic because you will loose a large chunk of armor generally 80-90% of your armor is gone in a body shot and then i really only need to land a second body shot or a team mate cleans you up. Head shots still can drop someone in one hit on average. It's hard to really know this without knowing the stats of every player you encounter, again just seems that way. 

Here is the over view. 3x providence, contractors gloves, fox prayers, and Ceska holster.

Gear talents, chest Perfect Glass Cannon and backpack Vigilance. Perfect glass cannon if you don't put them down in first shot or the second shot they should take you out. That being said yeah, i got a fast backup rifle for those you push or I run out on the M44. So my back up is the M1A, i have also used a Police Mk17 though.

https://preview.redd.it/2uufs0q5onp41.png?width=1734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a66ac526535a76ce9f34b589394844143c470c8

The stats to aim for. I feel that with a bolt action no-less and 57% critical hit  chance. with a bolt action any less starts to feel like you won't crit often enough and in pvp you really want the next bullet to crit if the first one doesn't. I don't have hard science on this, just going off how it feels.

https://preview.redd.it/iz9i7wnjonp41.png?width=257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7887fe001ae951aa5a1d4943c35cf7ef895a77c1

Primary. You want max damage to targets out of cover.

https://preview.redd.it/o8oemdmrpnp41.png?width=382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88d992935186cc5da6f02a89e1aff148d9839370

My other secondary backup that i was running was a suppressed Police Mk17. My backup rifles get modded for stability and an 8x. but i could see dropping the 8x on your backup and using like an assault rifle. Don't sleep on a good fast suppressed backup rifle, with stability so that you can quickly unload on the head shots with it. The Police Mk17 although probably not the best seemed to have the least recoil and best accuracy for fast firing. but it's what ever.

Heroic drop btw.

Seriously Massive you can't use the same standard routines to determine exotic attribute rolls you use for all the other quality categories.

It's fine if out of 100 high-end quality drops the average rolls are higher the harder the difficulty, while still allowing exceptional rolls on both ends of the distribution curve.

However exotics already come with the added limiter of low drop chance in the first place. If you insist on them also dropping with random attributes, you absolutely need to have a tighter range. 

An exotic - in particular if acquired on higher difficulty - should never have the chance to roll low.",23,1585509049,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/frbbh4/exotics_attribute_roll_range/,thedivision,6

frba1p,ScribbleAW,"The Division 2 , Ideas and suggestions for TU9 or beyond.","All these suggestions were made up from me playing on Heroic for a while. As of right now I have 15 days on The Division and 25 days on The Division 2.  My SHD level is at 180 at the time of making this.

If you manage to read all my suggestion, please give me your full, honest, detailed opinions or suggestions. I want to create a discussion about the balancing of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Remove Toxic grenade from enemy arsenal.**

&gt;Instead, make the gas a map mechanic the player can use toward enemy. Also make the gas more easy to see.

*You know the grenade, the one where it ignored your armor and completely depletes you of life with no chance of surviving it. If that wasn't bad enough, you can barely see it.*

&amp;#x200B;

**-Killing enemy's with a head shot will not allow them to be revived by enemy combat medics.**

*Not sure how hard this will be to implement, but of course, this mechanic can be played around with.*

&gt;For example: This mechanic could not apply to Named NPC combat medics.

**-Melee Attacking another Melee Attacker with a shield, LMG, or shotgun will stun them, making them unable to deal melee damage to the player.**

*For some odd reason, Melee Attacks deal more damage then bullets.* There should be a small window for the player to counter attack a melee attacker.  (The period where the attacker is swinging their weapon.)

**- Give Sharpshooter Class a robotic damage buff.**

*I've used my sniper build for the majority of the time I've played The Division 2.  ( I'm at around 25 days played, I'd say 20 of those days are with me using my sniper build.)*

*Whenever I'm in battle, I never shoot enemy electronics, weather it be Hyena turrets or Black tusk Operator turrets. I find that shooting them is not worth it, even when stacking damage, as Id would need to save each bullet of my clip to a NPC, not their tech.   I even leave BT war-hounds for last, after Ive killed all other NPCs. Fighting the warhounds, even when leaving them for last, takes around a minute and 30 seconds. Just to kill them, without taking damage. (Because you just need to stack damage when using a sniper build. So getting hit could be very devastating.)*

&gt;In the Sharpshooter Class, there should be this upgrade:  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Shooting enemy drones with a MMR will instantly disable (kill) them with one shot. Increase damage by 25% against enemy Turrets and Warhounds. (Only with MMRs)  
&gt;  
&gt;Of course, the damage percentage can be tweaked and messed around with, but I personally think it should be 25%.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Add Striker Backpack talent for PVE.**

&gt;Current Talent: Decreases stacks lost on missed shots for striker gamble from 3 to 2. (For PVP)  
&gt;  
&gt;Suggestion Talent: Decreases stacks lost on missed shots for striker gamble from 3 to 2,  Weapon hits amplify total weapon damage by 1%.  (up from 0.5% from having a 4 piece.)

*Reason: Striker isnt too great for PVE. It is just better to run negotiator's dilemma if you are trying to create a damage assault rifle build. (if you even choose to run a gear set.)*

&amp;#x200B;

**-Allow Hybrid builds to work with Electronics only.**

**(Tank/Electronic builds, DPS/ Electronic builds.)**

*As the player is a Division agent, we are the best of the best. One thing that makes Division agents a real threat is our advancements in our technology. Each player should be allowed to fully explore the possibles of their technology without the fear of them not able to deal enough base damage while also being melted.*

*Before Massive attempts to Nerf the enemies again, Massive should try out this idea.*

&gt;New resource: Phoenix Unit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dropped: Named Enemies and Hunters or SHD caches.  (Quantity's of 1.)  
&gt;  
&gt;Installing 5 Phoenix Units onto a gear piece will add 1 skill tier to the gear item.  That being said, remove the option to change core attribute to a skill tier.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, if the player chooses to roll minor attributes to skill based options, then some players could still potentially have better skill builds then others.

*I don't really like the idea of Massive nerfing enemies health and damage, especially if the player complaining about the problem is a player playing on Heroic difficulty. (Its heroic for a reason.)*

*The only real problem I can see is if that skills could do too much damage. That will either result in the players getting a base health buff, or skills being Nerf.  Of course like always, this suggestion could be changed around a bit.*

**Exotic Changes**

&amp;#x200B;

**Another Use for Exotic Parts.**

*I have a ton of Exotic parts by deconstructing horrible rolled exotic items. If you are already level 40 or have a gear score with 515, then getting these parts are useless. (Only other option is to sell your horrible exotic item for 250 units. Wtf?)*

&gt;My suggestion: An option to install a exotic part into another gear piece that you own, allowing you to roll another perk or talent on one piece.  
&gt;  
&gt;This feature can be played around of course. Like making it only work for talents, or having this option cost 5 exotic parts instead of 1.  
&gt;  
&gt;Installing an exotic part onto a exotic backpack or chest-piece will allow a normal base talent to be allowed. (On top of their exotic talent. If the player chooses to change the talent, it will cost another exotic part.)

**Allow for multiple Exotic weapons to be equipped.**

*The exotics are very nice, but not nice enough. Having more then one exotic weapon equipped can make the exotic grind more worth it. That being said, I think that the 1 exotic item gear equip is fine, having more then 1 exotic gear piece equipped could be broken.*

**Buff base damage for ""The Chameleon.""**

*Right now, The Chameleon at Heroic is garbage. You need to hit shots before you can do somewhat decent damage, and that's only when stacking damage on your gear. I think ""The Chameleon deserves a small base damage buff. Nothing too crazy.*

**Sweet Dream's talent rework.**

*This talent looks like it was made up by the developers on the spot. So un-creative and just not worth it.*

&gt;Current Talent: Melee attacks instantly kill non-elite enemy's.  
&gt;  
&gt;Suggestion Talent:  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Melee Attacks stun enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Melee attacking Red enemies increase weapon damage by 15%. Melee attacking Purple enemies increase weapon damage by 15% and increase base movement speed by 15%. Melee attacking Elite enemies increase weapon damage by 15%, Movement speed by 15%, and increase damage resistance by 50%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Named Enemies**

\-Increase base movement speed by 15%. (20% for rusher type enemies.)

\-Will never stand still.

\-Sniper base enemies will attempt to create distance from the threat.

\-Assault rifle based enemies will attempt to rush the threat.

\-Remove SHD tech from their arsenal.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Faction tweaks. (Directed for WT5)**

Not really important, but just a idea to make each faction more unique.

Hyena's

&gt;\-Increase Base Health. (Not Shield health)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Decrease Weapon accuracy for all enemy types.   
&gt;  
&gt; *Come on, Im sure we are all aware of the top elite, master of combat, Hyena SMG user who swings his weapon around and yet hits every shot.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Make Hyena Turret a normal turret  
&gt;  
&gt;*(Sniper or Normal Rapid fire.) Some Hyena's have electric stun turrets. Where did they get this tech? Makes no sense for a bunch of idiots to have this stuff and know how to use it.*   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Make Elite Hyena Rusher's have the Dazed status effect, not shock.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Like the drugs they take, when you shoot the weak-points.*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Normal Grenade only.

True Son's

&gt;\-Increase reload speed to all types.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Slightly increase base speed.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Riot Foam Grenade only.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Melee Attacks with bayonets.

Outcast

&gt;\-Molotov's only. (I think they already have this.)  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Melee Attacks with

Black Tusk

&gt;\-Slightly increase movement speed.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Shock Grenades only.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-Grenade launcher enemies have generate clusters, instead of normal grenades.

&amp;#x200B;

fra0mc,Z3RO77,Add more DZ talents and AI rogue agents to DZ,"Recently, I have been looking at the DZ talents and except for four tiers, there is only one option. In addition to this, it is not hard maintaining level 50. Please Massive, add more DZ talents to really mix up the way we play and the benefits we get. Like, add instead of having more space in the bag, better quality loot from the bosses so you have a choice or killing X number of players gives you a reward.   


Like in division 1 and the hunters, at extraction, add 1-4 rogue agents to have a chance to attack the extraction. This would give us great loot and provide a challenge.   


The DZ right now does not feel rewarding nor scary or challenging. I want intensity added onto amazing loot. You yourself have said the DZ should feel like this and it has not, but rather an easy loot farm where most do not go rogue cause there is not much value in it.

fr9yxa,DivisionByThanos,Gear Disparity is disheartening me...,"Overall I like Gear 2.0's streamlining... but I'm with everyone else on all the post I've read about build variety being dead and whatnot.  Some of these disparities are my main problem;


**Core Attributes**

- Utility is the only static core attribute, always +1, never needing to be rerolled or maxed out.

- Defense gives a fluctuating flat amount of armor. Offense gives a fluctuating plus percentage of damage. 

- The flat amount of armor gained from Defense is unevenly weighted the higher in difficulty you go compared to the percentage of damage you gain from Offense when increasing other attributes such as Criticals, Headshots, and conditional multiplicative damage increasers. 



Why shouldn't Utility, Defense, and Offense all be a static attribute?

Defense could provide a percentage of damage reduction against bullets similar to the Deflector Drone, instead of a flat armor value.  Armor should be an attribute instead, to go along with explosive resistance and other attributes to enhance Defense as criticals, headshots and others do for Offense, and to help Defense retain relevance in higher difficulties even when not using a Shield Build.


**Named Gears' Attribute Disparity simple comparison:**

- Firm Handshake +10.5% Status Effects.  Not only can +Status Effects roll on every piece of gear, all six, it already maxes at +10%.

vs

- Fox's Prayer +15% Damage to targets out of cover.  Not only does this not roll on any other piece of gear, it only comes on LMG's core attribute max 12% I believe, and 10% as an attribute on other weapons. Damage to targets out of cover is also a multiplicative damage attribute.

What are Named Gear supposed to be offering?  I've seen many post that their advantage is simply that they come with a maxed out attribute.  The only ones people are using are the ones offering unique attributes, or more precisely the Fox's Prayer or Contractor's Gloves that offer multiplicative damage bonuses you can't get on any other gear.  

Personally I'd love to see more that offer things such as +Max Armor or even a Named piece with +Damage to Elites (It won't rock game balance only being on a single Named piece).   As long as we have more named gear, with more options, that offer more unique attributes.   Also it'd be nice if they rolled on random Brands instead of predetermined ones unless the plan is add a lot more.   And I mean a lot.  Otherwise I don't see build variety branching out anywhere...


There's a ton more I'd love to ask/write about, between talents, status effects, hazard protection... but honestly I'd just like some of this discussed by the developers, the legit game balance, after all the Damage Glitches, Control Points, Gear Sets are fixed and everyone's back to work.",33,1585504345,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fr9yxa/gear_disparity_is_disheartening_me/,thedivision,3

fr8yoo,Hexlicious,"Massive went from this game being friendly for solo and unfriendly for groups, to the complete opposite in the last patch, why are they not learning, and what can we do as a community to fix it?","After the recent update I have mainly been playing in groups, but decided to pull off the time trials in the league (again) solo before they are gone on Tuesday, and I've honestly never had a less enjoyable time in this game than trying to do things alone.

Now if I was to do that mission in a group I'd likely have no problem at all, through the entire mission I got a total of 95 enemies and did 462 million damage, which means on average the enemies had about 5 million health each, granted red, purple and yellow have varying amounts of health.

Now let's take my character, I'm currently at 700k armor, my bullet king can hit upwards of 600k and my MG5 hits for closer to 900k, everything on me is 95% god rolled, the talents are vigilance and perfect glass cannon (so technically I got around 300k armor)

For an enemy to kill me, it takes them maybe 3 - 4 bullets depending on type, sometimes they can just 1 shot me (great feature btw, love it...), for me to kill an enemy it takes nearly x5 times that, sometimes much more, there are more of them at once, and they deny my cover so any chance of me taking on a group in a smart way will likely leave me on fire, poisoned, blown up or just laying on the floor in a puddle of my own tears cause peaking will leave me losing my head, and the sheer agony of that thought just makes me crawl up into a ball, and the outcast wondering where the fuck I went.

Now in the end I did manage to pull it off with a 12 minute run, which is fine, it's within the limit, but the amount of effort it took me to get there, and the complete lack of any loot I would ever have a use for, I felt like my time wasn't very well spent, and if I did something else the feeling would likely have been the same.  


All I want, and what most people want, is a game where the PvP is balanced (Like Division 1), where enemies don't murder you in milliseconds (like Division 1), and the gear feels meaningful and powerful, and hitting higher numbers have a serious impact on your ability to tackle harder content (Like.. Division 1?)  


Yeah, I am pretty sure I just want Division 1, or the scaling that is currently in the Dark Zone in terms of PVE, the enemies still hit rather hard, but they aren't so spongy so it's far more enjoyable to play, just port that over to the main sections of the game and you have a winner Massive, it sucks you don't realize it.  


The fact people go out and exploit in order to concur harder content and have what they define as fun in your game, maybe that should be you realizing that your game might need some serious adjustments.  


People want to spend their time like it's worth something, they want to spend it doing something meaningful that will in the end reward them with something interesting and useful, spending a decade killing a single enemy while they can one shot you is not that Massive, it really isn't.",19,1585500778,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fr8yoo/massive_went_from_this_game_being_friendly_for/,thedivision,1

fr8mwk,coupl4nd,Consider the L86 -- the assault rifle masquerading as an LMG,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/enmtuloe0np41.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a278d9e707b6e0932033fce2426dd8980bd6919

&amp;#x200B;

So I got this god roll L86: Max damage, damage to armour, and damage to out of cover. Put the talent of my choice on it, which has been strained (other suggestions welcome) and... well it's pretty beastly. I never would have tried it if it wasn't for the roll and I have to say I may have been sleeping on this thing.

**What's the big deal about the L86?**

The L86 is not belt fed. It reloads by magazine like an AR, and takes all the same attachments as a 5.86 AR. This includes a barrel mod, which the MG5 doesn't have. It's base reload is under 3s, but most would probably want the magazine that gives 20 rounds but slows that time to 3.1s. It seems to suck because of that base magazine. It's only 50 bullets!? My MG5 can hold 100... But what people forget is it is super snappy to reload.

**Why not just use an AR?**

Many reasons. Health damage is nice, don't get me wrong (I run Hollow Mask), but it's no replacement for out of cover damage, which LMGs get a big helping of. Plus you can then add damage to armour. Just as important, the best in slot gloves in the game are LMG damage. The best in slot knees are rifle. Then you want to stack your crit via a mix of Providence and some others, throw in a mask for extra crit, or health damage like me. Putting on a Fenris piece is taking away from some of your crit chance or damage. Don't get me wrong, you CAN use an AR. But it's not as effective as using an LMG/rifle... but now with the L86 you will feel like you are running an AR again. It's a really nice change.

**But come on, the MG5 is king, right?**

Well, yes, and no. Just comparing bullet to bullet, RPM to RPM on max rolls the MG5 burst damage is 8% higher. The MG5 is without doubt an amazing LMG... However, in order to run an MG5 you really have to put fast hands on it. Because otherwise you're looking at a 5.3s reload time and that is just too unwieldy for situations where you need to reload and get back in the action (ninja knees could work too, but no Fox Prayer!?). But that's fine you can put fast hands on and get your full stack and the time is down to an amazing 2s. But what have you given away in order to do that? Another damage talent. So let's think about strained on an L86 vs fast hands on an MG5.

**Math time**

The first thing to note is that even with a 50 magazine you get plenty of strained time on an L86. The thing fires at only 600 rpm. It's a hard hitting chunk damage kind of gun, which I've seen crit for just shy of 1 million damage on an NPC. The 2.5s ramp up time for strained is basically half the magazine, leaving a lot of bullets left that do quite a bit more damage. So let's crit cap ourselves and start with 100% crit damage. After 2.5s this jumps to 150% crit damage with the L86 (well, actually 155% because muzzle attachment!). And over the first magazine before either gun has to reload the L86 now does 7% more damage per second than the MG5. So the L86 with strained is going to out burst an MG5 with fast hands all else being equal. Of course, you could use an MG5 with strained and out damage the L86... but that reload... And 1 magazine, it's worth noting is a decent length of time. It's 5s of shooting. If you don't feel the L86 can do work then check it destroy this heroic tank boss single handed at the end of Federal Bunker, which I ran in 21 minutes heroic to test this thing and surprised myself: [https://streamable.com/py57k](https://streamable.com/py57k) 

In the interest of fairness, it must of course be pointed out that over 3 magazines the fast hands MG5 wins out because it has such snappy reload, doing the equivalent of 13% more sustain damage. But again, the L86 with strained will out burst it.

**Summary**

I still think the MG5 is overall the better gun. With fast hands it's just very dependable and you can pretty much always have the magazine full and ready to go. If you can't crit or can't aim that's another matter. But I was genuinely surprised by how well the L86 handles itself. It's really nice having an AR feel with the LMG benefits. And it hits damned hard as well, out bursting an MG5 over the first 5s of shooting. That's not something to be discounted. Check it out.

Mouse movement is smooth in menus but my character's movement snaps and stutters, it reacts only once I've stopped moving my mouse, unless I move it really, really slowly. Everything was working just fine before today.

Here'e what I've tried so far without success : 

* Update drivers, windows.
* Delete shader cache, reset all settings
* Change TheDivision2.exe cpu priority in registry
* Change to DX12 (was using DX11)
* Toggle input latency setting, vsynch, frame limiter

Next step is to reinstall the game and rollback windows update but if someone has fix, I'd rather try that first.

fr7kod,sniphskii,Anyone else just not having fun anymore?,"Pre TU8. This game was a ton of fun and hell, even the WONY content was fun. But after a couple of weeks since launch its pretty apparent that the game has changed for the worse.


Obviously there's been many PvE issues (such as the contaminated area that we STILL can't get into) but I'd like to expand on that by going into the PVP issues I, personally have had


The changes to TTK means that everyone and their grandma is now switching to the tp build (so much for build diversity) and, while I'm on the subject of gear sets I'm fairly sure I've seen a few people killed by their skills getting full flagged.
(also, hard wireds 4 piece talent still doesn't work) 

The dark zone itself doesn't feel as fun to grind because the levels feel extremely limited. (only 50?????) and the loot feels equally lackluster

The removal of grey rogue was, IMO a bad choice because it was a fun system. And meant rogue agents could blend in a little better

The thieves den's removal means theres now an achievement and a backpack trophy added to the lost of ""things massive say they're gonna fix but never do"" and also shuts off another way of getting loot. 


Speaking of ways of getting loot, the vendors. 99% of the stuff they sell isn't worth it, ESPECIALLY inaya. Why is she selling blues and purples with only 1 high end? 



I don't know, there's more I could say but I feel like I've made at least some of my main gripes with the game at this point. It's time for me to take a long break from the game.

MORE Bullet sponges ? THAT is an Event ? You have one of the best looking worlds in the gaming industry and THAT is your event ? Like, there is nothing better you could come up with ? 

Just random ideas that literally i came up on the spot : 

1, Treasure hunt : Find a special case with clues you can find around the world (markings on walls,   
letters, and so on, rewards could be even stupid vanity items, clothing, blueprints etc.

2, BT deployed a new Warhound! Take it down with your friends! : Group up with friends, search, locate   
and take down the new Prototype Warhound (Warhoumd would be way slower, 3x Bigger, with tons   
of armor and weapons to match, point is to break the weak points on his legs, front and back,   
keeping his armament locked down with breakables on them. With that you can expose his core   
with damaging the joints etc.

3, Climbing tower : Grab any skyscraper and make a puzzle out of it to get on the top, outside on vents   
   and and inside through apartments and such manners.

4, Dance with the Children : Find children around the world and dance with them, its silly, but still   
better then MORE bullet sponges.

5, Racing : 4 Agents compete on who can get from point A to point B the fastest. (can be done solo   
against a leaderboard, there are soo many great spots where you could do this.

6, Boxing arena : Literally throw 4 agents into a fenced of zone and let them try to bash their heads in,

The devs claimed that to compensate the talents would be more powerful and build defining. What talents are these exactly? Because most of the talents I've come across are identical to those in gear 1.0 just swapped from chest to backpack or vice versa. Most of them are boring too; ""do x for 25% more damage"" or ""do x for 5% more damage, stacks 5 times"". Anything that is remotely interesting is crap in practice. Take creeping death for example. It's designed to spread status effects but the distance is only 5 metres. It's useless.

The budget system had it's issues but at least it was fucking interesting. Like hybrid builds? Tough because they are useless now.

Despite the fact that this system is so dumbed down weapon, skill and build balance is way worse. How does this even happen?! Literally every gun build now consists of m1a or mg5 (I got a really well rolled Good Times m60 and the damage was still about 30% lower than my frankly shit mg5. Like how?) .

fr4py2,Azubalf,The game doesn't feel rewarding but grindy and boring,"I have been playing since launch and since the expansion I feel like the fun has been lost and it's a boring grind, by that I mean :

\-season pass doesn't feel rewarding and can be done in less than a week 

\-league can be done in 3 hours and there's no replaybility, no reward back on the second week

\-Global events are a joke

\-Loot is a mess and doesn't feel rewarding at all

\-Lack of replaybility, once you are done with the stuff grind, the exotic grind, there's no goal set, the SHD levels are just smoke to cover to lack of it

\-How in a game like this we don't have any dailies or token like activities to get stuff or cosmetic, the game feel empty

\-Players have left the expansion after 3 weeks???

\-Developer focus on a wide public instead of trying to maintain a core of player and fidelising it

fr3r60,Cyshox,Gear 2.5 : Minor Attributes &amp; Passive Talents,"I think TU8 is great despite current issues. However I feel like build variety is lacking now. It's wether full Red (DPS Crit), Blue (Shield Tank) or Yellow (Healer/Skilldamage). Hybrid build feel way too weak / are pointless currently. To improve the build variety I would suggest 2 changes :        
       
**1. Core Attributes can roll as Minor Attributes at half the max value**         
       
Armor &amp; Weapon damage should roll as minor attributes at half the max (7.5% weapon damage / 85k armor). For Skill Tier I would add 5% Skill damage/haste/duration/repair to the Core Attribut. Minor Skill Tier offers no bonusses.       
       
To prevent inflated numbers weapon damage, armor or skill tier shouldn't roll twice on the same item. So wether core or minor - not both.         
        
**2. Bring back passive talents**        
        
It would be nice if passive talents could roll on masks, gloves, holsters &amp; kneepads. Wether non-stackable at noticable percentages or stackable at low percentage increases. Alternatively allow 3 active + 3 passive gear talents.         
         
**So, what do you guys think about that?**         
        
Imo it might be an easy solution for a much better build variety.

fr2oka,Flamecoat_wolf,This game's endgame is everything I feared it would be.,"Unfortunately I think I've reached the end of my time enjoying The Division 2 after just a week or two. (I did play almost continuously though the week, so no shortage of hours put in.) 

The reason I say this is that the end game is dreadful. There's a lot to do but none of it feels enjoyable like the rest of the game did. Mostly because you're forced to play on the harder difficulties if you want to get decent gear. 

I played on normal for a good number of hours but didn't see any equipment with more than a third of a bar on any of it's stat rolls. So I just wasn't progressing within the endgame. However, when I moved up to higher difficulties, even only to hard, the enemies became bullet sponges. It took ages to kill them and I found myself running out of ammo (for the first time and then repeatedly) before I could finish bounties, control point captures and mission objectives. Their damage also went through the roof and I found that I would lose 1/3 or more of my armour any time I tried to pop up out of cover to take a shot. Add to that their propensity to flank from all sides constantly and I found the only way to survive most of the time was to use the bulwark shield and backpeddle to the side, to try to keep all the enemies in front of you. 

What works isn't necessarily fun though. I had enjoyed using a shotgun most of the way through the campaign and had a great amount of success doing that. However, the shotguns just aren't viable in the end game it seems. I can empty my entire magazine into purple enemies without them dying, or just barely killing them on the last shot. It feels awful. The whole point of the shotguns is to encourage a run and gun, risky play-style. That just doesn't work when there isn't any risk since it's a certainty that the enemies will kill you long before you kill them if you try to get close. 

I tried my hand at conflict and the dark zone. Both of which seemed like they might be fun but then I got hit by the obvious pvp balance issues. I tried to look up what kind of builds these people might be using but ended up just finding a thread or two about hackers being fairly common... 

Essentially my time in conflict was spent shouting ""How is my shield broken and why am I dead when I shot that guy repeatedly and his armour is still full!?"" I would give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they were using that ""when your armour is broken restore it to 95%"" talent, but even then there were often enemies who's armour didn't even go down before shooting back up. There was a game or two where a full team of people were somehow inflicting fire with just their weapons. Maybe an exotic or something? Removing your ability to aim is just cancer in a pvp mode. So yeah, didn't go back to that again. 

Dark zone I tried much earlier and it was actually quite fun... Except from the PvP aspect. I mean, I get that that's the point but rogue agent status is stupid. It only lasts for like 30 seconds. So people can kill you and then be consequence free before you re spawn and go back for revenge. Also, it's the kind of thing that you should only be able to go into solo, or have separate servers for solo and group players.  You basically have to go in with a group if you want to take part in the PvP otherwise you'll just be outnumbered and crushed. Which means you pretty much should only go in with a group because even if you try to avoid the PvP there's a fair chance people will try to ambush you during the extraction. So again, didn't go back to that. 

Essentially, none of the game modes are fun any more. 

Even with all the cool and interesting looking content that's being released it's just not going to be fun if I have to play against enemies that feel bad to play against. It seems like there's just no reward for actually getting to the end game. There's no progression any more, it's like you're just forever under-levelled now. All that cool gear that does literally millions of damage is useless because the enemies are scaled up to have billions of health. It removes any feeling of accomplishment for gathering and perfecting gear. That in turn makes the grind for better gear pointless and that, in turn, removes the main objective of the end game making it boring. 

Anyway, this is just a rant that I hope the devs see and consider when re-balancing in the wake of the DLC release. Seems unlikely but oh well. 

If I've missed something that somehow makes enemies not bullet sponges and somehow reduces the amount of damage I take to manageable levels then feel free to let me know. As I said at the start, I just recently started playing so maybe there's some stuff that I've managed to miss. However, one without the other isn't any good. I could make myself nearly invincible and then spend 3 hours fighting a single elite, alternating between my shield and armour regen, but that wouldn't be fun. Similarly I could get to a point where I could kill red enemies in one or two shots but if I get one-shot by every second enemy then I'm still just going to make no progress. 

Oh, and I play solo mostly, which makes a little bit of a difference I guess. It seems difficult to find games though. I don't know if the matchmaking is bad or if the playerbase is just way down but matchmaking takes an age.",34,1585470654,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fr2oka/this_games_endgame_is_everything_i_feared_it/,thedivision,1

fr1pbc,DGhostFly,I just had an idea about builds and difficulty.,"You know what would improve this game a lot AND made it so much easier to balance properly? Getting rid of red stats on gear (outside of stats on weapons, they still should be there to differentiate weapons from one another). I know it sounds dumb at first, but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

No more weapon damage, crit chance, crit damage etc. Weapons just deal damage that they deal and that's that (outside of perks of course). ARs deal more damage to health, SMGs crit a lot but work well only short to mid range, MRs deal much more headshot damage, shotguns strip armor easier etc. Instead now what you can do is just go either for skill build and complement your character with heals and/or turrets etc. for higher difficulties or go for blue and tank damage much easier instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Enemy HP and damage become mich easier to balance because you don't have to factor in people's stats and builds as much. Skill builds and especially tank builds would become much more viable (especially on higher difficulties). It would require a pretty big balance pass while also adding some new stats (and gear sets etc.) as well as buffing some existing ones to make up for the loss of red stats, but in my opinion it would benefit us all in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

Build variety wouldn't suffer because I don't think there is much variety in red builds department anyway. You just mainly stack damage and crits. Talents would still be there (at least most of them, some might become obsolete, but I can't think of any right now that would). Some conditional damage bonuses would still be there from talents, so you could buff your damage a little bit if you wanted to, but at most like 15-20% in most cases.

&amp;#x200B;

Things also become easier to farm because there is a whole group of stats that just ins't in the loot pool anymore, so stuff you can use actually drops more often and has the stats you want more often. Some hybrid tank/skill builds might be more viable too.",8,1585465123,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fr1pbc/i_just_had_an_idea_about_builds_and_difficulty/,thedivision,1

What if your agent instead of killing Keener, decided to lock him up instead. We know your Agent took his watch but what if from inside his cell he finds a way to only keep in contact with you alone and you decide not to share this information between you an keener.

Each day or as the season progresses you get to come back and talk to keener or as your adventuring throughout the world potentially different types of echoes ( or something we have not seen an echo do before!) appear throughout the world but this time with the new watch (Anna I believe?) that you took from keener and as you view them Keener gives you remarks or some snarky comment as he monitors you as well.

Would be so cool to have had some sort of Batman / Joker dynamic going on with him locked in his cell when you come by to visit, maybe he smiled at your agent and releases information slowly about the rouge network and things to come.

There was this one skill build user who kept going rouge on people doing landmarks. I meet some people in an extraction zone and we group up to protect ourselves, at this point I turn on my microphone. We start talking and I realize the guys in my group don’t know eachother but there is also a language barrier. I didn’t think anything of it as I occasionally meet some spanish speakers in the DZ as I live in the US. I eventually realize that none of these guys speak Spanish and I thought it was a little weird. I ask them where they’re from and one is from Portugal and one is from Germany. I start to think I’m in a different server than the one I’m supposed to be in (this wouldn’t be the first time as a few days prior I was in a world tier 3 server for some reason). I conclude after talking to other people in the lobby that I am on European servers. We had a hard time communicating but we eventually end up using google translate. We played for a long time until I inevitably lagged out since I was on servers on a different continent. We added eachother and I end up playing with the Portuguese guy a lot afterward. He showed me how to get masks which I didn’t even know was a thing, I explained to him how named items worked (which was more complicated than I thought it’d be). I never had anybody to play with but now I do thanks to what I presume is a bug. We can roughly communicate as I speak Spanish and I can understand portugese somewhat but we still have to use a translator occasionally. We’re thinking about getting the expansion and playing it together. Thanks to this bug I have now made a friend who lives across the world.

I’m enjoying the game for the lost part but I’d really like better loot to drop for heroic. 

I play solo (I can’t group up because it’s not fair to leave a squad if I have to tend to family often) and I’ve been playing heroic and legendary, a lot. I’m not getting great rolls. A lot of times I’m not getting targeting loot, either. 

I’ve waited to post this to see if I had bad luck for a few days in a row, but switching characters or using different builds doesn’t change the rng. The loot is not good. 

I have noticed that if I use a LMG build on a mission, I’ll get a lot of LMG drops. If I use rifles, I’ll get rifle drops.

fqw3yp,Nehryt,Need a decent AR build for solo,"Hi !

Freshly level 40 I really need you. 

I have to find a good build. I’m mostly solo. 

I search an assault rifle build, with unbreakable I like this talent but if you have another talent why not. 

For the moment I have nothing, so I would like a start. 

How much red ? Blue ? 
What’s the cap for the armor to solo ? 
Now what’s the best stat to priorize ? Weapons dmg ? Cc ? Dcc ? 

For a decent ar build, how much should be my ar dommage to be good ?

Which brand priorize? 

Which exo are required ?

I know, it’s lots of question but i’m lost. It’s the first time I tried to make a build and it’s hard...

Thanks for all

fqv3k6,altanglefilms,How to turn your control points back to red,"Yes, there is a solution. And it does work.

Had that same ""bug"" that everyone moans about. All the control points in DC were captured and absolutely nothing happened for over a week - and I sighed and thought ""How the hell do I farm blueprints/targeted loot now?"". FU Massive. You lazy, half-arsed, inconsiderate bastards!

But then I used my brain a little bit. Watched what was happening on the map. And then the idea came. And after a little time and some fairly obvious but incredibly simple trickery... little red guns began appearing and control points fell. And now I have my pick of red control points again. And I can now take back control points and they will be retaken by enemies afterwards.

Wanna know how to do it? Sure you do.

It's actually really simple. First, wait for a weekly Invasion. You don't have to but it really, really helps.

So let the Invasion happen. You can do Invaded missions. But leave at least one and don't touch the Strongholds (obviously if you leave one Invaded Mission you won't unlock the stronghold anyway). 

Next, reset your Manhunt. What you should have now is the West side of the map with red control points and the south side of the map with Black Tusk everywhere. Now, don't touch a single one of those red/yellow control points. Just leave it.

Now, just go and do some missions. anything but touch control points. I mean you played with all green control points so just keep doing that. Just don't touch those control points.

Pretty soon (within a day for me) little red guns will start appearing. One at first then eventually multiples. And control points will start falling.

You can help it along by eliminating a few Black Tusk activities nearby a green control point. Think about it. Why would the Hyenas attempt to take back Air Force One with all those robo-dogs roaming about?

Once you've got the map mostly red again you can go ahead and do the Invasion stuff and Tidal Basin.  You can also start taking back control points but don't be greedy. Leave a few in each area so that your civilians are not completely closing off opportunities for the enemies.

There's no invasion or manhunt (yet) in NYC. So no solution for that. Sorry.

fqtgqt,jugglerbenjamin,Comparing TU8 Gear with Division 1 Gear,"I've been thinking about some of the discussion I've seen surrounding the TU8 gear changes, and I think a lot of the problems people are experiencing stem from the level of compromise players are required to make when making a build.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing on its own, but it's a shift in design that (understandably) doesn't work for everyone.

To be clear, I think compromising between the skill, DPS, and tank archetypes is important to have clear builds that impact how you interact with the game.  In my opinion, the problem lies in how much compromise has to be made -- if you're making a DPS build for heroic, investing in yellow or blue attributes is a bit pointless since the slight increase to skill power/survivability comes with an equivalent reduction in DPS.  For example, a 4 red 2 blue build isn't really well-suited to heroic content at the moment.

I only got into Div1 about a year before Div2 came out, so I'm not overly familiar with how gear was before that point, but the compromise we currently have to make with the main attributes in Div2 seems to be a bit smaller in Div1.  In Div1, you could get gear that contributed equally to Firepower, Toughness, and Skill Power, but even outside of that, a Firepower piece contributed a smaller amount towards Toughness and Skill Power.  In Div1, I got to a point where I could solo Challenging content with a build that had reasonable DPS, survivability, and skill damage.  I think that sort of hybrid build is something that's been hard done by in TU8.

I wonder if the potential solution to this issue might be in the Specializations -- the Technician specialization already has a spot in the skill tree that can increase skill tier, and this frees up a gear slot to be either DPS-oriented or armour-oriented.  I think if each of the specialization skill trees allowed you to increase, say, 2 attributes from Weapon Damage, Skill Tier, and Armour, hybrid builds would be much more viable and even specialized builds would benefit.  Of course, Weapon Damage and Armour would have to be capped like Skill Tier is (i.e. 90 % cap for Weapon Damage, 1,020,000 cap for extra Armour), but I think this might be a good option for providing more build variety in high-difficulty content.",3,1585432439,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqtgqt/comparing_tu8_gear_with_division_1_gear/,thedivision,2

It doesn’t seem like a step up like normal-&gt;hard and hard-&gt;challenging.

I can double-tap Elites in Challenging with my Custom M44 (3 man scaling) . Meanwhile I’m Heroic it takes 4-5 headshots (3 to break armor and 1 for the HP).

I still die quick in Challenging (maybe too quick). But, on a fire team of 3-4, the TTK seems about the same between us and the enemies.",13,1585430859,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqsyt4/high_difficulty_jump_between_challenging_and/,thedivision,0

fqslmh,slinky317,A rant about grouping,"So I'm a fairly new player to Division 2 and was working through the Outcast stronghold with another random player. Everything is going fine until we get to the end (I think) where we have to blow up the tanks and the boat and we wipe like 5 times. Eventually the other player leaves, and I get a message in the bottom left saying that I'm in their session and to revert to my personal progress, go to the social menu.

I'm afraid that even if I manage to complete this mission by myself it won't award me credit since that message says I'm in the other player's session, so I go to the social menu and leave session, thinking it will start me over at the checkpoint right before the tanks/boat section. NOPE. IT TOOK ME OUT OF THE MISSION COMPLETELY WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WARNING.

I wasted an hour of my time doing this garbage mission getting spammed by fire spewing bullet sponge assholes just to lose all of my progress. If that message was correct and I wouldn't have been marked as complete if I managed to finish it on my own, then that needs to be fixed. If the message was incorrect and I would have marked the mission as complete if I finished it even though I was in the other player's session, that message needs to be changed because right now it sounds like it doesn't. 

This is why I'm hesitant to do groups because of the way it just throws you in people's sessions without really knowing where they are.

fqpc3e,bigburgerboy92,Specialization Skills Suggestion!,"I think since the Gunner Specialization is specifically catered to rootin tootin shoot em up shooty builds, perhaps Banshee Pulse should also scale with Offensive much like how the Ballistic Shield scales with Armor/Defensive. This same suggestion could easily be applied to Sharpshooters Tactician Drone since that is also a high-offensive specialization. 

Survivalist Mender Seeker could scale off Armor/Defensive to compensate a similar play style as a Shield builder, Kind of a mix-match Offensive/Defensive build style, ya know ""Survivalist"" 

Demolitionist Artillery Turret is obviously a High-Skill Tier build.
Technician Artificer Hive as well.
 

In the games current state, DPS builds have no skills to use beyond Revive Hive for saving their own tushy.

With a Zero Skill Tier build each Skill is essentially useless to Offensive builders, and that kind of defeats the purpose of a Division Agent, doesn't it?

fqp1c4,binarycove,Why Survival makes more sense as a free to play stand alone like Warzone.,"I’ve been clamoring for an updated version of survival since the Division 2 launch announcement. It surprised me that this really unique game mode has been infinitely shot down by the dev team. Perhaps, it’s because they are working on a stand alone version of it that will be free to play. 

I think the most critical point we need to admit is that an updated Survival mode would be wasted content when pay walled off within the Div2 ecosystem much like it was in Div1. The most glaring reason why is not a lack of player count that can occur when making it a paid expansion that potentially splits the community. More importantly, it just always was and would be again a very inefficient farmable end game activity for loot. I was there. I absolutely loved the game mode but let’s face it, i didn’t play it if I wanted loot and this is a “loot shooter.” The matches were exhilarating and long episodes of intense action. These epic races against the clock that lasted significant amounts of time for a couple caches was far from useful if your looking for gear upgrades to min max. 

This game mode and it’s unique brilliance within the survival/battle royal genre could really shine in a free to play environment.  
Not only would it open it up to a substantially larger player base but also serve as a gateway into the division game itself for new players. Cross promotional content by way of cosmetics and special events could really boost the new player count in division proper.

Speaking of cosmetics, this seems like the most logical reward system in a updated survival. In the realm of Apex Legends or PUBG, we could provide some nice revenue gains for the company as well as providing some unique rewards for players who run duel season track lines for both Div2 and Survival. 

My only replay-ability grip from the original was the need to randomize loot locations every session. If they succeed in doing that and follow this type of format I really believe it’s a win-win not only for the franchise but for the player base at large.

fqoq86,THEHITMAN2K,I've noticed a bug when it comes to the hardwired gear set. At least in my situation.,"I put together a very awesome hardwired skill gear set. And I am using the btsu data gloves. I use the restorer hive as my primary source for my Seeker mine cool Downs. I'm wearing four pieces out of the six. So my problem that I've noticed here. The backpack Talent, Short Circuit. Which decreases feedback loop cool down from 20 seconds to 10 seconds. Meaning, I throw out a Seeker mine and about halfway through the cool down begins. And it would take about 10 seconds for me to throw the hive down to reset the cooldown on my Seeker, then I wash rinse and repeat.
 The issue I'm having is. It doesn't always go on a 10 second cooldown. I have to wait almost 20 seconds to redeploy my Seeker. It's like, when it works as intended. It's incredible. But sometimes, and even a lot of times. I'm not always getting that 10-second cooldown buff.
 Is there anyone out there that is using a hard-wired gear set and came across the problem which I'm having?

fqogu8,AREspirit,The Progression to a God Roll,"So about a week maybe 9 days ago a friend infected me with a silly superstition. He said that the game has some BS built in progression system. He convinced me to just hold onto my old gear as I progressed and with nothing to lose I did just that. 

I don't know if it was luck, coincidence, or if there is some progression system that looks to see what gear is in your stash, but I went from a meh piece of gear to a god roll. I hate that this is now what I will be doing going forward, but if it worked once might as well keep with it till it is proven to not work.

I know it is probably a BS superstition and you don't have to remind me, but it worked for me so I don't mind hoarding a little bit of gear for a while if it leads to positive vibes or good drops.

Insert (Jason Schreier, Kotaku) article here

Is nobody in the Game Dev industry listening?

I may not be a Game journalist from a popular magazine but the writing is on the wall. Its borderline insanity: doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result.

Gamer's as a whole have been disrespected over and over again. Is our time worth nothing to you? for once we would like to see our time respected and have something to show for our time invested. This does not mean once we acquire something great we will say ""well that's it for me, I got what I wanted so I am done"", No; we play more. 

we are all just tired of the constant bait and switch tactics game companies get away with. Rather then everyone come together to form lasting relationships between game company and gamer, its a constant struggle. 

What are you guys (Massive) so afraid of? tells us what your thoughts are. The community is listening. More time and resources have been spent fixing this glitch then actually fixing other aspects of the game that have had more of an impact. Loot shower was not the worst of it. 

Lets move forward and try to make this game great again.

fqmpao,RetiredSupport,Rant. Just need to write this somewhere,"I have almost 800 hrs into Division 2. Almost 2,000 hrs into Division 2 across Xbox and PC. I love the series, it’s probably my favorite gaming franchise I’ve ever been apart of. When WONY trailers dropped I couldn’t wait, the hype for me was on another level. 

However, as much as I enjoyed playing through the manhunt in NY, my disappointment of the new end game matches my hype for the release. I’m a solo player. I don’t know anyone IRL that plays, I’m in a clan but it’s not the most active clan in the world and honestly I just prefer it over playing in a group, always did. The difficulty spike was intense but I welcomed it. I was quickly able to do challenging and after a few more days after WONY released I was able to run everything on Heroic. Even though I was having success in beating the higher end content I really can’t remember anything that was truly fun about it. It’s not fun playing through a mission knowing you can get on tapped by a random gas can you didn’t notice and have to start the whole mission over that netted you 15 min of wasted time and no loot. It’s not fun almost having to run an M1A. Yeah, other weapons types are useful, but you’re really just making your life harder my not using it or LMGs (which I hate using). I loved playing skill builds in Division 1 and clearing Legendary solo, all of the skills minus clusters and so clunky to use. They all feel like absolute shit to use, so running skills builds in this game has been a no go for me since launch.

I almost feel betrayed by Massive for the state of the game right now. I’m not even going to get into all the bugs. This post really didn’t have a point I just needed to type this out, I’m just bummed out that my favorite game is damn near unplayable for me right now.",4,1585410819,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqmpao/rant_just_need_to_write_this_somewhere/,thedivision,1

I have one character that's in the middle of the New York campaign (my main) who's about level 35, a new character I boosted to level 30 with the level boost included in the expansion and a brand new character I've been using to replay the story who's level 25 and about half way to maybe two-thirds of the way through the campaign. Are any or all of these characters able to play the event?

fql6s9,RhezzVa,Let's talk about PVP - rant,"Okay, so. How to begin with this. I was a long time Div1 player. The start was rough but game at the end of its life was finaly good and to no suprise - enjoyable.

At launch of Div 2 I knew that the game would most definetly go trough polishing process to get it to best state possible but last year was like watching blind man navigating trough thick fog.

With every bigger update meta shift - mostly bc balance team have a hard time getting meaning of balance. I know it must be hard bc of how much elements now have to work together to get things work but shieeet man. Notings really work. Right now u have few examples: Pestilence + True Patriot, Eagle Bearer + System Corruption, Glass Cannon M1A, Skill Buils (Seeker, Hive, Fire Holster). It's wonderfull that players find ways to get things running but this also shows how hard is to not overdo one thing when adding different element makes shit crazy. 

Talents for weapons, chests, backpacks. Most of them are basicly useless and non usable while others that require almost nothing give shitload of stats. Synergy is good but in terms of that I feel like they went into quantity over quality. Out of 44 gear and 35 weapon talents how many did u actually ever used?

Gear Sets currently there are 3 decent sets, 2 somewhat okey, rest is literally garbage that either doesn't work in proper way or have no way to utilize them in PVP. Striker made comback yhm, not rly. U get better weapon damage bonus by using any other combination of talents on chest and bp instantly without having to stack. Right now u can't get even past 20-30 stacks during PVP and u lose out to much in terms of survival against somone running like system corruption without any reds. I'd rather see copy-paster gear sets from Div1 that acutally worked fine.

Weapons thats still quantity over quality. Not balanced stats of base dmg, rpm and mag sizes which allows to abuse whole concept (M1A is a perfect example). Last update to gear and nerfs during maintence are like using bandage or head that was blown up to pieces (recalibration is nice tho).

Exotic gear / weapons even when they are being reworkes the ones that are usefull now are those with abusable effects (skill haste imperial dynasty with no counter to it) while others like dodge city holster are dog shit (1 shot from pistol 55s cd). Chameleon's talent looks like it was designed by random gear generator.

Personally in terms of PVP best state of Div 2 was just at the launch of the game, since then every change is another step back. 

TL;DR

Div 1 gives much more fun in terms of PVP. Div 2 is and will stay unbalanced. How hards is to look back to see a resolution of current problems?",14,1585405773,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fql6s9/lets_talk_about_pvp_rant/,thedivision,1

After all these patches addressing exploits and broken shit, they should focus on getting these other weapons up to snuff for Heroic and Legendary. In regards to skill and tank builds?

With the nature of it, I've been playing around with a damage build at the same time after running support/tank for pretty much the entirety of my Warlords time. 

However, running an all red, I have around 660k armour, so basically it is one shot town. I've been able to offset that with Unbreakable to some degree, as it basically means now I need to be two shot rather than one shot, every minute or so. I also like using the Turret for ad control, even at 0, he is a useful little companion. However, neither the Revive Hive or Perfect Clutch worked like I'd hoped. 

At tier 0, revive has an insanely long cool down and gets me back up with so little armour, I basically just die straight after it revives me. And I dunno if Clutch is broken or what, but I haven't seen this thing proc once and it doesn't even really matter anyway as if by some miracle a hit has only taken me down to 20% armour for some reason, I'm unlikely to be able to claw back anything at that point, so I may as well just use an armour kit. Healing skills, even maxed out, are pretty shite without some dedication in the build, so swapping out the revive hive for the healing drone doesn't seem to help much either. 

Is there anything else I can toss into this mix to make it a less sweaty experience?",19,1585400392,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqjqxa/what_are_some_good_survivability_talents_i_can/,thedivision,1

fqitt2,Curalcion,Sniper Turret damage overview,"Hi there, I'm toying with my sniper turret build since the expansion was released. There are a couple of different ways to create your Sniper Turret build (there are more than enough guides out there) so I ran the damage numbers in the shooting range with different talent set-ups. I thought I share it with you.

All damage is done with a Tier 6 Sniper turret (with + 84% extra Skill Damage from Gear/Brand/Spec) as body shots against challenging named enemy on the shooting range (I rounded down the last 3 digits to zero for ease of reading) :

&amp;#x200B;

**Damage Numbers:**

Baseline without any extra talents: 2.662.000

&amp;#x200B;

* Overwatch: 2.945.000
* Spotter: 3.520.000
* Perfect Glass Cannon: 3.285.000 (this is with only +75% Skill Damage instead of +84%)

&amp;#x200B;

* Overwatch + Combined Arms: 3.602.000
* Spotter + Combined Arms: 4.400.000
* Perfect Glass Cannon + Combined Arms: 4.107.000 (this is with only +75% Skill Damage instead of +84%)

&amp;#x200B;

* Overwatch + Combined Arms + Artificer Hive: 4.903.000
* Spotter + Combined Arms + Artificer Hive: 5.990.000
* Perfect Glass Cannon + Combined Arms + Artificer Hive: 5.590.000 (this is with only +75% Skill Damage instead of +84%)

&amp;#x200B;

Baseline + one other talent used:

&amp;#x200B;

* Spark: 2.803.000
* Perfect Rooted: 2.945.000 (this is odd as it should be higher)
* Tech Support: 3.150.000

(I haven't tested Shock &amp; Awe but it should be somewhere between Spark and Tech Support)

&amp;#x200B;

Baseline + other possible damage buffs:

&amp;#x200B;

* Weapon with Damage to Armor: no difference
* Kneepads with out of cover damage: no difference

&amp;#x200B;

**Observations:**

1) Spotter is a big damage boost as it is multiplicative damage, Glass Cannon seems to be additive and the numbers were not as high as I thought considering the downside. Also Spotter was a bit inconsistent bc the talent did not proc every time even though the target was pulsed (via technician laser pulse)

2) Artificer Hive increases the final damage output by roughly one third and is in my opinion necessary for higher group content. Take notice that the hive buff is not a constant buff, it gives your turret one damage buff at a time (=one hive charge) which is consumed when you shoot with the turret. When I'm solo I use stinger Hive for cc though.

3) The damage buff of Spark is not decisive, you can use it if you land consistent head shots but I prefer other weapon talent options

4) Tech support is an oddity as my numbers don't make sense, also it was very clunky bc you have to wait for the buff to trigger and then set-up your turret, reapplying the buff is very cumbersome. In short not really the best choice for Sniper Turret builds. I use a Bakers Dozen as my secondary, pairs well with Sniper Turret and Combined Arms.

5) Unfortunately ""+% Out of Cover Damage"" and ""+% Damage to Armor"" does not affect the Sniper Turret

6) You can run Acostas exotic bag if you want but you will lose roughly one fifth base damage (bc lack of BP talent) but double your dps as overcharge gives your sniper turret double shooting speed. If you also use the artificer hive you should get a Skill Damage boost of around +12% which mitigates the base damage loss a bit. This is really up to your preference if extra another step (throwing grenade) and CD suits your play style.",37,1585396589,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqitt2/sniper_turret_damage_overview/,thedivision,1

So, rifle build in hand, I barged my way into tidal basin, looted the adrestia box only to find a purple, pp19. Bollocks. Then maybe it was because I already had a level 30 nemesis in my stash, so deconstructed it and waited a day for the reset and off again to tidal basin where, the adrestia appeared, got dismantled and gave me the tally part I needed. So one fast travel back to the crafting bench later, I find my level 30 crafting blue prints are missing and the level 40 blueprints for nemesis, chatterbox and liberty are sitting there instead. Score!! So re farmed the part from capitol building, now I just need Roosevelt and district union rotations and I’ll hopefully have a level 40 nemesis.

fqhpc9,llpqll,Is the 100% accuracy hip fire from NPCs in cover is back?,"Anyone have the same experience as me? I press them in cover, and want to be closer to kill that enemy, and I got one shot when I was moving.
And the NPCs not feel like the same as we faced in TU7.
I guess the time they make the TU8 balance changes is a long time ago. And, when they start this project, its using a client version like TU4 or 5. And between that version up to TU7, those balance changes as well as small changes(maybe NPCs behavior) are not added in to the TU8 version.(because it's based on TU4 i guess)
Just a guess. Because the NPCs doesn't feel the same. And the TU8 patch size is almost one full game. So the game is rolling back?

Few more things I think it needs to be change. About balance.
We need to have a method to counter the enemies attacks. Such as those status effect. I need a way to instantly remove it, and the way to remove it should take a cost.
And the directives back from D1. Developers just bring it black, but not considering this is not the same game. Like the ammo capacity one. 
Back in D1, we have way more ammo in out backpack, and if necessary, we can use ammo stations to temporary matain the ammo level, and that cost is one skill slot. 
And in D2, no way I can counter the stupid directive. I have run back a few scenes to restore ammo, or forced to use pistols. Especially the enemies are sponge now. Take out one enemies will use almost half the ammo. I do miss my ammo station.
Another one is special ammo. have anyone run the black tusk mission with special ammo on? If you get shocked, you are already dead. Another thing we can't have a way to counter that. (All other games with status effect, have a way to instantly remove the effect)
In D1, we have immune station, a healing skill(don't remember),or use medkit to instant remove it. And now in D2? We can't do anything but waiting. And I don't think it's possible for all of us to have like 90% hazard protection. Need a way to instantly remove it ,and it should take a cost. And imagine we have predator gear set back in D2, it's absolutely a king.

fqhfro,SHDeathtravel,"If there is a word to describe Massive, it is ""arrogance"".","I'm tired of this game constantly repeating previous mistakes. Perhaps the producers are trying to prove in this way that the decision they made in Tu1 is right, and the player's fatigue and pain is only a matter of the player.

I'm tired of fighting dozens of enemies at once. Their DPS is too high, their HP is too much, each of them has a higher data than the player. Will you meet dozens of powerful enemies at once in the Dark Soul? will not! D2 is too hardcore, D2 is harder than Dark Soul.. 

Enemy explosives can cause 100w damage to agents at one time, and the number of such enemies is very large. How is this different from Tu1? 

Enemies with strong armor are now harder than Tu1. The most terrible thing is that their number has increased significantly.

Maybe Massive wants to make D2 became the “the Dark Soul” in TPS, but they add too much RNG elements to the game, which makes this game look like a disaster.

BUG is not the biggest problem in this game, but the difficulty is not directly proportional to the revenue...Difficulty can make players feel frustrated, as is randomness. Although they will also give the player happiness after success, the frustration after superimposing the two is too strong! !!

Massive may think they made a change, but I don't think they've ever actually played a game they made.

I don't understand why they can't learn from other games, maybe this is their ""pride"".

I don't understand why they can't really test the difficulty of the game first (testing with cheat is very very stupid), maybe this is their ""style"".

I would like to call these ""arrogance"".

\--I have been patient for a year, but this ""global event"" has disappointed me, especially the new daily challenge. It has neither the joy of D1 nor the reward of D1. It's cumbersome and difficult, but rewards have only one exotic.. I don't want to endure anymore.

fqg0zd,Pulsing42,Suggestion: More rogue encounters!,"I love open-world gameplay, I avoid missions if at all possible, sometimes I do missions either for the challenge or just a change-up, but facing rogues is something I've always loved, especially on harder difficulties.  It keeps you on your toes while never knowing when they'll appear to drop you or offer an opportunity for good loot.  


The first rogue group I encountered I thought nothing of it, they looked like standard enemies so it never bothered me, that's until they started using defender drones, hives, seekers and turrets.  It was exciting and challenging, one of the mixes this game struggles with even though I know massive are trying to deal with the issue.  


Having these appear more frequently in random activities and while roaming is going to keep not just casuals on their toes but also hardcore players.

fqfn3i,Hap_R6,"The Division 2, is not to hard.","This might be an unpopular opinion but.. Me and my friend group, we actually enjoy the division more then ever before.. From speed running heroics, to trying and succeeding our first legendary. The game doesn't feel  ""too hard"" for us, it feels just right, the good mix between being able to relax, or to go for an actual challenge..

For clarification, NO we do not use glitches and our gear is not min-maxed, we use a well rounded mix of builds to make our lifes easy. One of our friends has a good and solid tank build, where he will just take all aggro from enemies away, meaning the DPS can just freely damage whoever they want, without getting damage tossed their way.

Another completely specced into healing, and heals 1.4m armor on impact with both his hive and chemlauncher, making sure our tank and DPS can continue doing their jobs to just cut through the  mobs.

Then we have people who run crowd control builds, just making sure the enemies are blinded/ensnared/on fire 24/7. Also making sure they are not actively shooting any of our players.

And then ofcourse we have DPS players, all with their own style, LMG builds, AR builds, Rifle builds and SMG builds.. You name it, one of us has it. And whilst having all these builds, we have someone to take lead and call out what we are doing, and where we are going. No, not super hardcore, just casually like: ""Focus the tank on the left first"" or ""Fall back to previous cover""

The thing is, the game is hard when you DO NOT work together, when everyone just does whatever they want.. Thats not what a co-op looter shooter is meant to be. You cant just toss random gear pieces together without building with a purpose, and expect to run heroic with ease.. It requires some dedication, planning and communication.

Should heroic be for the 1%, no, totally not, but it shouldn't be FREE to everyone and actually require some dedication and skill to reach it. So go grab yourself some friends, make sure everyone has a goal to reach with their build, have the right mindset and communication, and youll see it will go with ease..

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Heroic missions and Legendary missions are super doable, and to make complete them, you need to have build diversity in your team (Yes it does actually exist, what a shocker) Example, for Legendary district Union we ran: 1 full CC build, 2 Full DPS builds, 1 Hybrid DPS/CC build..",35,1585380887,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqfn3i/the_division_2_is_not_to_hard/,thedivision,1

fqeo3c,Lord_Despairagus,A new players feedback of the game...,"So i'm new to D2, i've been playing for about a month or so now and this quarentine has left me tons of time to play through content so i'd say I have my feet pretty wet. With that I figured I'd give my impression of the game so far as I know how I feel about it pretty certainly.

First off let me say I really like this game. Im a looter shooter fanboy and nothing for me beats the feal of going into a game with shit armor and forming a character into a savage. I've played Destiny 1 &amp;2, and Warframe plus some others so this isn't my first rodeo.
But back to me liking this game.....I do. The game has a fun feel to it (not talking end game we'll get to that later) . The gadgets are really cool, and the gunfights can be fun. At first I played like. Sniper, setting up my turrent and plucking off guys from afar as my turrent shredded people who got close. Then I recently discovered the fun of the shield and I haven't gone back since.  It feels awesome getting aggro focused on me as my teammates flank enemies or move behind me as my shield absorbs enemy punishment. Running through the story and normal missions is fun as hell and gives something I havnt felt from a game in a while.

But before long a whole ton of negative popped up.
First off the Black Tusk; I love the idea. I love the idea of an endvame faction too that is meant to be challenging to fight. But challenging is alot different than annoying hard. It was hard enough dealing with the robo dogs that ran around spraying grenades and minigun fire like crazy but then i started doing hard and challenging missions with Black Tusk and I can definitely confirm what I've heard before coming to this game , about Division 2's legendary tanky enemies. I mean the Black Tusk are hilariously unfun on higher level missions. Almost everyone has grenade launchers they free fire at you, and while you move to avoid the grenade you get melted by a robo dog. Or the other tanky black tusk members waiting to see you peek. I cant describe how shit it felt to finally craxk a yellow bars armor and almost kill him, but as i duck behind cover tk avoid death, a health kit they deployed heals them back up significantly. It's really a punch in the gut. Plus i mean they have sooo much health but also dish out insane damage.

Another thing is.....so miniguns need to be absolutely everywhere ? I mean its like Oprah gave out miniguns to people in DC before the outbreak. Its crazy how many times Im desperately holding on to cover as a minigun keeps me pinned down. Its kind of annoying to add a limitless non stop firing high dps turrent to almost every encounter while mobs of tanky yet really mobile enemies flank you.

However the one thing I literally hate to see in this game are the meatballs with miniguns. Lol again too many miniguns but when you allow a dude with plates Nd playes and plates and plates and plates of armor tied to him to walk around with one it becomes horrible. Id be slightly okay with it if these guys were bosses but their enemy types. They deploy with other yellow bar tanky mobile units and tanky robo dogs. The amount of rounds that have to be put into these guys is jaw dropping. And hitting their weakspot dosent even electricute them for a period of time or cause them to drop their minigun or anything. I think they yell oh shit then keep firing on you. Also why the hell are they dicks ? I throw down a turret 50 yards away from one and he sprints his ass over to me hops on a wall and one shots my turrent. Like hello hes already a ball of dps armor no need to be an ass too. 

But all that has been said by the community, I just wanted to add my own experiences.

The last thing I wanted to being up was that this game seeming has no moments of power. By moment of power I mean a moment where you as the player feel in control. You feel like a savage. Destiny has tons of criticisms but one thing I love is the feeling of popping a super. It always feels, sounds, and plays epicly. The first time I saw the cutscene as my character got the Tac 50 i smiled from ear to ear. I thought it was finally the Division's time to shine. Finally i'd get to have that savage moment. But then after using several of the special weapons or whatever they are called.... their is no power behind them. Like yeah they do decent damage but you bet your ass those mini hun meatballs will take several crossbow bolts and keep firing.",2,1585375914,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqeo3c/a_new_players_feedback_of_the_game/,thedivision,1

How about creating a skyscraper where a elevator brings you up stage by stage. (in the end Elevator entrance &amp; exit changes level design)

* Stages are on a grid, which is always randomly created. Cover in terms of office stuff should be placed randomly in the room.

* Spawn points could be doors which are also placed randomly

* Enemies scale from level to level

* Special Bosses? (Raidlike? with mechanics, but soloable) should appear every 5-10 stages.

* Enemies spawned (Black Tusk, Cleaner etc.) Randomly choosen

* Loot - you can invest Crafting Materials (or gear) to boost your dropchance for loot related to brands, weapon types etc. (investing exo mats could increase exo chance) similar to targeted loot.

* Would be an option for massive to test and see what scaling players are capable off (if they collect statistics)

fqd900,Tattooey89,Defender Drone in PVP,"So I encountered a group of rogue agents going man hunt. Me and my group fought these guys for an hour straight. They are 1 to 2 hit with the bakers dozen dropping all of us. Running a tank build.

So here’s a little background info on my build

Primary Weapon Lady Death

Overall Weapon Bonus Damage is 100%
+60% LD Damage Stack Bonus
57% Crit Chance
%114 Crit Damage
Fox Prayer Kneepads
Contractor Gloves
Hollow man Mask

So I’ve tested this build against numerous players both intentionally testing and just plain old going rogue and killing rogues. This build is a beast for destroying armor and very quick to put players down. So anyone usually rocking around 1.2 million armor to 1.6 million should be dropped in about a clip if all shots make contact shooting at center mass.

So when I encountered this manhunt group it was only two players at first however they seemed nearly impossible to kill. In fact I couldn’t kill them at all. Everyone in the lobby was being punished by this group. Upon looking at there builds it was nothing special except 4 piece patriot all stats armor and armor regen. They all used a pestilence which being shot once just put the controller down and wait to die.

It wasn’t until later in the fight did I realize they are using a defender drone which seemed to negate about 80% incoming damage from other players.

Which made sense why a full clip with 160% damage output couldn’t even break 3 bricks of armor barely 2. I wonder if this intended or not to be so powerful.",14,1585369467,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqd900/defender_drone_in_pvp/,thedivision,1

fqaach,qpsyche_warframe,I think we can squeeze in a praise post in here,"Let's be honest, this subreddit is saturated with complaints and tears. For good reason too. God knows I've had my fair share of whining.

But I need to detox before I actually go and uninstall this game with all the hatred inside me, so let's make a bucket list of everything we find great about the game post-WONY.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I love the addition of Rikers and Cleaners in DC. Let's be real here: Massive didn't have to bother even touching DC, let alone redesign the open world and check points to include these new factions. It's thanks to this that we got memes like Cleaner tanks vs BT doggo. Perhaps small, but definitely appreciated.

2) Rogue agent encounters are some of the best balanced aspect of the game imo. It never feels like a nuisance nor does it ever feels like a freebie. I've never seen anyone say ""just die and let them disappear, it's not worth it"". The loot they give, while not super-exciting, aren't all that shabby either. My triple god-rolled Mk16 came from a Rogue. The fight, while difficult (mostly due to skill spam), is not half-bad honestly. The skill spam is only overwhelming if you ignore it then 5 min later go ""there's a drone swarm in the sky"".

3) Gear 2.0. Can we just make this into an endless praises for Gear 2.0 post? Recal library is amazing. Talents actually synergize and with only two of them, the build is never really overwhelming to casual players. The new overcharge system is so good and really diversifies skill builds (like, really your creativity is the limit it seems). Gear 2.0 is amazing.

4) Raid is actually worth playing again even if not for EB. Right now, raid gives the best loot/min in the entire game. For me it drops at least 5 or 6 god-rolled gear every run and a double god-rolled every one or two runs. My AR build, which has every attribute maxed or within 1% of max, mostly came from raid exclusively.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Putting RNG on Exotics attribute is genius. Removing DTE and Exotic holster talent was a brilliant as well. This one's a bit controversial, so let me explain.

Before, if you got an exotic, that was it. There was no reason whatsoever to chase that exotic ever again because all exotic was identical. This is why people go ""got EB, never touching raid"" or ""got diamond back, fk Kenly College"". You wanted replayability? There's your replayability. Talk about incentives m8 you can chase a BETTER EXOTIC. People complain that exotics are rare enough. The fact that I can be 300 hours into wony and STILL be excited everytime an exotic drops is an amazing feeling. The game doesn't feel nearly as stale as you put more time into the game and it's partially thanks to this.

Holster talents. Removing this imo falls in the same line of thought of removing the DTE from masks; they're too invasive. They force themselves into any build, regardless of reason, because they're just that good. Unless you're running some niche double gun build like double Black Fridays, you're gonna carry an exotic and that was pretty much a necessity. That's not build diversity. The devs want to make exotics worth a gear slot for the merit of what the weapons are capable of (\*cough\* i know... \*cough\*), not because they're a talent-stick.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk these are the ones I could think of off the top of my head. Feel free to add your own folks.

Also, chill on the whining if you have any, at least for this post. The devs are quarantined and taking care of themselves and their family like the rest of us mortals. Give them a break if they can't fix the CP reset this week or week after. Not like you're going to work tomorrow either.",34,1585357876,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fqaach/i_think_we_can_squeeze_in_a_praise_post_in_here/,thedivision,1

Have a decent skill build and was trying T4 checkpoints to unlock some blueprints (changed difficulty to Heroic for T4 CP) - but don't get any blueprints. Also I have only 4 projects - the daily resource donation project is MIA (saw this in a pre-DLC vid).

Question is post-DLC, is this the correct way for unlocking blueprints?",8,1585353292,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq8z8s/new_player_help_t4_cp_blueprints_and_daily/,thedivision,1

fq8v64,moose4,"Hit the ""endgame"" and now I'm struggling pretty hard - suggestions?","Hey agents.

I've had TD2 since it came out but have always been what you'd consider a filthy casual...never even done the Dark Hours raid, done fairly little group content in general, never really tried to push myself to be superl33t.  I just like having fun with the game, I love the world, I love the story.  But now that I've hit 40 and finished WoNY, the TU8 world is proving something of an unpleasant surprise compared to pre-Warlords days.

Right now I'm SHD level 20.  I'm running four-piece Striker (mask, chest, holster, knees) along with a Devil's Due pack with pretty good rolls and a set of Airaldi gloves that aren't anything very special.  6 base reds.  (During leveling I always tried to keep 1-3 pieces of Skill Tier stuff but I wanted to try four-piece Striker after getting it.)  I'm using a Glory Daze (+11% AR damage, +8.5% health damage, +7.5% CHC) and an Everlasting Gaze with a D50 as a sidearm.  Gunner spec, about halfway filled out with +15% damage to AR and LMG and I'll pick up rifle as the third.  Currently rolling at skill tier 0 with an airburst seeker (aka the ""rollypoo"") or striker drone (aka ""Bob the drone"") and a healer chem launcher.

I can't even solo Capitol invaded on hard right now, especially with trying to do the Polarity event.  Even with 665k armor I'm just getting demolished.  And I know I need to ""git gudder"" but man, Hard used to be easy.  Hard is not easy anymore.  Normal almost seems too easy and Hard is, well, hard.

I guess my question going forward is, trying to figure out how to move forward with coming up with a build that's AR/LMG/SMG on one hand and rifle/MMR on the other (basically, one short-range automatic and one long-range for softening mobs up and picking them off) that will let me do better at soloing Hard-level content.  I am not even thinking Heroic or Legendary at this point.  I'm not good enough at shooters for that.  But I used to be able to do Challenging no sweat with a Dodge City LMG build.  I'd like to be able to get close to that again even though I know it'll never be that easy post-TU8.  Anybody got any suggestions as I work up through the SHD levels and events?",13,1585352907,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq8v64/hit_the_endgame_and_now_im_struggling_pretty_hard/,thedivision,1

fq8qxy,peterlai2,"The division is just not fun,or enjoyable","So with the lockdown and all, i thought I'll give this game as ago. I've played alot of it, finished the campaign , lvl 30, gear score 515 etc. 

I like to complete things, not becuase i liked this game. It just feels, at no point during the design of this game, did someone ask; what will make this game fun, why would people want to play this. 

I play alot of other similar game, borderland, destiny etc, and they all have a fun factor about it, somethign that makes you enjoy killing the cpu, pvp etc. 

In the division it just feels like work, hard work for very little reward. The ai just doesn't miss on the higher levels, if your running out, they will hit you 100% of the time and not miss a bullet, even if they're 400 meters away. 

So you end up hiding and sniping, but the enermies has 3-4 special weapons to defeat this, nade that again don't miss, no matter the range. Drones, etc. This on its own isn't an issue. Sometimes I try the flanking, for that i use a m60 that does about 25k damage, you need about 40 bullets for a red enermy and about 80 for the purple. But becuase the ai doesn't miss, you end up in cover alot and poping up and firing, or waiting for the ai to pop their head up.

But you also get enermies that does nothing but run away and hide, so you end up just playing tag with them, or in certain levels where they are above you, you just got to sit there for 20 sec, wait for them to pop their heads up, so you  can shoot them once. And repeate this 5-6 times to kill them. 

For me, the worst thing is, related to the ai not missing. You can be trying to snip them from across the map, and their machine gun fire will hit you everytime, and causes you to flinch, which means you can't aim. 

The combination of these things, just really kills the fun for me. In short:
    * Ai that constantly hide
    * Ai don't miss, not matter the range or weapon. 
    * Grenade don't miss and it's spammed.
    * Ai healing kit is way OP and never ends. 
    * Your constantly flinching becuase the ai don't miss, meaning you can't aim.",16,1585352502,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq8qxy/the_division_is_just_not_funor_enjoyable/,thedivision,1

The lack of the use of any raid mechanics, communication or understanding of how to complete the raid was absurd. No pre Razorback assignments, someone just yolo’d and jumped down and ran immediately over a gen. I took up 2 gen and looked to my left and saw 3 guys on 3 gen. Worst part is that they all stayed, for all the rounds. After being blown off twice, we end up needing only 3 damage phases because of the glitch. Worse than any discovery raid I’ve ever silently been apart of.

fq88gt,lassevk,Youtubers are now ruining Division 2,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYSY8qvHVM8&amp;t=31s

How much are you willing to bet this glitch was discovered since the last patch, and not before? Do you seriously think all the dps and talent stacking glitches we've seen over the past week were discover one after the other, after the previous one was patched? Or do you perhaps think that whoever was looking for these glitches were looking at all the ways they could break the game, at the same time?

With all software there is bugs. It's inevitable. It's guaranteed. There are too many lines of code, too many ways things can interact for every contingency to be checked, tested, and fixed, before release. It's just not possible.

Yes, Massive released a broken game, even disregarding the glitches altogether and they released a broken game.

But I **seriously** doubt these youtubers are discovering 1 glitch, then waiting for it to be fixed, before they discover the next one.

No, they almost certainly know of a number of glitches now and just dole them out one after the other, as each one gets patched.

Why? Because if you post 1 video with all the ways to glitch the game you will get less views, less ad revenue, compared to one video for each glitch, after the dust has settled from the last one.

The most likely scenario is not that once one glitch is patched, people get back on the turret to see if they can find something else to break. The most likely scenario is that they've already done that, and already know ten ways 'til Christmas to break the game.

So what do you think Massive has to do? They have to scramble to fix the glitch. This glitch, the most recent one. And just after that, another one. And then another one.

Imagine how this impacts your wish to get the gear sets fixed. Or the skills, or the control points in NY not resetting.

Imagine if they were given a list of all known glitches right away. Imagine that the time they spend scrambling to fix these glitches could be spent elsewhere. Like fixing the gear sets, or the skills, or all the weird UI bugs.

But no, instead the people looking for these glitches give them to Massive one at a time, like cookie crumbs. And then wait for that one to be fixed, before they give them the next one. Because that serve *their *interest.

The problem is that it doesn't serve *our* interest. I want a working game, without glitches. I want Massive to be able to spend time on fixing all the other isses with the game.

But no. We can't have that. We have to fix the latest glitch that someone waited to tell Massive about until they had fixed the last one because that gave them, the youtuber, more money.

That is what I see as the most likely scenario.

So in my opinion, the Youtubers are to blaim for the current state of the game. Not the initial state of the game, that is still on Massive, but the youtubers are now serving their ad reveneue, not us gamers, and Massive is scrambling to keep up.

Now, you might ask, do I have any proof of that? No, of course I don't. But as I stated earlier, all software has bugs. It's inevitable, it's guaranteed. The rest of the software world, however, has landed on a ""due diligence"" method of informing the producer of said software first and give them time to fix it.

We're not seeing any of this here. The youtubers who are posting the information about these glitches are not looking out for you or me, the gamers, they are looking out for themselves.

I go for the extraction, they just wait around the chopper. as soon as I want to attach the loot, they go rogue and instantly gun me down. If I go rogue first , they still gun me down cause guess what, I am alone and they are 2-4 people, and everyone oneshots.

fq669b,jjones8170,Hybrid System Corruption Solo Build,"While I recognize that there are some serious issues with the game right now, they are not stopping me from playing or having fun.  I split time pretty evenly between solo and group play in Heroic, doing a combination of open-world events, bounties, CP4's, and Invaded Missions.  It can be difficult and I do die sometimes, but I've had some fantastic gun battles where I wasn't just kiting enemies into choke-points / rinse -repeat.  I've never been much of a pure-DPS-build-guy so I've been messing around with 3/3 builds.  The one I am going to share with you is a 3(6) / 3(3) / 0(4) build.  I've been using this as my main open-world solo build due to it's sustain and ability to output reasonable damage.

**GEAR:**

Mask: Golan Gear Ltd, all attributes God-rolled(Armor\[core\], Skill Haste, Armor Regen) with 11.1% SK mod

Backpack: Badger Tuff, God-rolled Armor(core), God-rolled SH 12%, and 11.7%CHD (98% of max) with 4.8%CHC mod and Calculated

Chest: Zero F's, God-rolled Armor(core), God-rolled Armor Regen 4925HP/s , and 11.7%CHD (98% of max) with 4.9%CHC mod and Perfect Unbreakable

Gloves: System Corruption, God-rolled WD (core), 10.4%CHD (87% of max)

Holster: System Corruption, God-rolled WD (core), 11.8%SH (98% of max)

Knees: Golan Gear Ltd, Gold-rolled WD (core), God-rolled CHC 6.0%,  8.5% HZP (85% of max)

Total armor = 1.2M, Total health = 272.7k

The two pieces of Golan give me 10% Status Effects and 1.0% / sec Armor Regeneration.  The two pieces of Badger Tuff give me 10% Shotgun Damage and 5.0% Total Armor.  Finally, the two pieces of System Corruption give me 15% AoK.  The key to the sustain on this build is really the 25% AoK (15% from System Corruption and 10% from Gunner Spec) and the 21K / sec Armor Regeneration.  Unbreakable is there for those ""Oh Shit"" moments. 

**WEAPONS:**

I'm using an ok-rolled Pestilence as my main (+10% LMG, +9% DMG\_ooC, +5% DtA) and a God-rolled KSG (SG Dmg, DtA, CHC) with Fast Hands.  Sidearm is a God-rolled Backup Boomstick (SG Dmg, DtA, and a worthless mag size) with Close and Personal.  

While not fully invested in Reds (offense), my Pestilence is still doing close to 85K / bullet and it's talent is very, very strong.  Sometimes, I'll spray down a group of enemies to give them all PotO and then finish the group off with the DoT and KSG.  I usually reserve the Backup Boomstick as my ""Oh Shit"" weapon when someone gets too close.  

**SKILLS:**

For skills, I'm using the Banshee Pulse and the Demolisher Firefly.  Even though I have 0 core pieces invested in Skill Tiers and *I'm not* using Technician as my Specialization, with Calculated on the backpack, my Banshee Pulse is usually available every 7 - 8 seconds (base of 10.9) and the Demolisher is available every 25 - 26 seconds (base of 38.3).  The Demolisher Firefly is really the equalizer for this build, especially when facing enemies that use a lot of skills.  I'll try and target remote controllers and grenadiers with the first one and medics as secondary targets.  Once skills and grenades are taken off the table, it becomes a straight up gun fight where you just need to pay attention to your positioning.  I have another variant of this same build that uses EMP Jammer Pulse and Blinder Firefly.  I'll use this one when fighting Black Tusk enemies in the open world. 

If I had to change anything, I would try to get rid of the CHD on the three gear pieces in exchange for CHC.  That would help the reload speed on the KSG via Fast Hands.",7,1585344383,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq669b/hybrid_system_corruption_solo_build/,thedivision,1

fq4ygl,Jacklin43OG,Upgrading Gears/ Re-rolling each attribute,".  This is my personal thought on the gear system in the future, if it is possible, it would make the game more interesting, enjoyable and less hassle when managing your gears ( for me, and imo of course). 

.  It should be that when you find an item, let’s say a holster with low/medium red core attribute, and 2 minor low/medium attributes like crit chance, and crit damage. If you are a dps guy, it is a perfect combination roll for you, the only thing is that the range of the rolls are kinda mediocre. Which leads to my next suggestion, which is:

1.  You should be able to upgrade that said holster to the max, like max rolls everything. You have every each roll you need already ( red core, crit chance, crit damage). Kind of same as recalibration in D1.

2.  For other type of gears, let’s say you find the same holster but with red core, one minor  crit chance attribute, and the last minor one ( such as status effect for example) is the one you do not need for your build. Then you can reroll that attribute to crit damage (if you are a dps guy). BUT then, once that holster is rerolled, you then can’t upgrade it to the max roll everything anymore.

3.  By having this system, the game would not be so cheesy and easy where a piece of your gear can be rerolled and upgraded to the max at the same time. If that is the case in the future, it’s cool but then it will be boring very fast because you can reroll and upgrade a piece of gear at the same time, which makes farming less fun and less RNG based

4.  So in conclusion, you should be able to upgrade a said piece of gear/weapon if all the rolls combination are the one you need already, (just the range of the rolls are kind of low). For other piece of gear, when one of the attribute being rerolled, that piece of gear can not be upgraded to the max anymore.

That is my opinion, and english is not my first language so sorry in advance for any misspelling or word replication. If you guys have any idea regarding the gear system, I would love to hear your opinion, cheers and stay healthy guys.",1,1585340810,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq4ygl/upgrading_gears_rerolling_each_attribute/,thedivision,1

fq4m9s,wildchomo,The truth about the damage glitch,"The truth about the damage glitch is simple... 

The truth about the damage glitch is that NOTHING IN THIS GAME REALLY MATTERS. 

None of the loot you find matter, none of the achievements you get matter, nothing really does matter to anyone but YOURSELF. 

A lot of people are frustrated because some players took advantage of a bug to gain VIRTUAL items, VIRTUAL leaderboard ranks, VIRTUAL challenges etc. 

Does any of it matter? Absolutely not. Honestly, your personal satisfaction after accomplishing anything in this game, is irrelevant.

Parade your rank, gear, items all you want but at the end of the day, no one cares. NO ONE. But you.

Play the damn game to have fun, that’s it. If someone’s glitching to get some irrelevant virtual item and it bothers you, you need to seriously reconsider the importance you attribute to certain aspects of your life. 

It’s pathetic to see people virtue signalling because they ran something on Legendary “legit” and some other people didn’t. 

We’re not in an open world where people’s action affects everyone else’s. 

Guys, enjoy the damn game in your own way. Whatever the other guys are doing in their own sessions, it isn’t even affecting you personally other than hurting your own minuscule egos. 

The state of the game is completely miserable. I feel like some people are unable to cope with it and want to witch hunt people who found a way to make the game enjoyable for THEMSELVES. 

Nobody’s going to remember you for anything you’ve done in this game, go do something to be remembered for in the real world. Something meaningful.

For once, we finally have a weapon against the predatory system that is RNG and against the bugs plaguing this game. 

Realistically, if people get banned or punished for using it. All that will be left is the 1% of losers who are sitting here circle jerking their fake moral code. 

Have fun agents. Enjoy the game in your own way and let others enjoy it too.",19,1585339802,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq4m9s/the_truth_about_the_damage_glitch/,thedivision,0

fq3the,Ralfzer0,Should the abusers of the DPS/Loot glitch get banned?,"Hello everyone.I hope everyone is safe and healthy.

I created a video about the loot glitch and the dps glitch which seem to ruin the game at the moment.

A lot of people want the abusers to get banned, while others justify the abuse of these glitches due to how ""broken"" the game is right now.

Some people dont care at all, while others, including myself, have a different approach. I think that these players should be punished but not banned,except

the ones that used the DPS glich against other players in the Darkzone.

Here is the link of the video where i share my opinion in more depth.

Know what's scary though? You know it's broken as hell when 4 people are using a damage glitch and still can't finish a mission in 15 minutes lmao. Those times are so unrealistic it's dumb.

 Before you kids start crying, I'm 38, work 60 hours a week, and don't have the time you do to grind grind grind. (Didn't get anything noteworthy anyway while using the damage glitch.)

It was cool to explore and fight bosses you wouldn't normally be able to solo though. And I play games to have FUN. Don't really care about anything else.

Note: you couldn't use it in the darkzone anyway.

Legendary missions? It felt like a HARD CORE mode.

In PvE it boils down to gun dps having one dominant build **independent of weapon choice** and cc skill build support. 

Obligatory: Yes, I am aware anything lower than legendary you can run your skill dps or tank builds but those rank so far behind the above mentioned in endgame that the entire loot chase comes to a complete halt as you basically only look for ever so slightly higher rolled versions of the gear that allowed you to run legendary in the first place.",11,1585336705,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq3kgq/gear_20_will_open_up_build_diversity/,thedivision,2

fq3h1q,Adam_Shira,"Welp, my 2 cents for state of the game","I started to play this game when it launched, don't have thousands of hours in it, but I can say that I played enough. I already read about the upcoming fixes at April, this is more of a another PoV.

&amp;#x200B;

1, Enemy scaling / Damage - Honestly ? I think its in a good spot right now, what needs to be done   
with  that is the accuracy of their weapons / Throwables, damage fall off and so on, the Hyena   
moonwalk   is just too accurate, I mean, he is holding a shotgun/SMG in one hand shooting, there   
should be no  accuracy at all past 5m

&amp;#x200B;

2, Hazzard damage - I think there was said more then enough about this.

&amp;#x200B;

3, Loot - I fully understand that this is a looter-shooter MMORPG, but the loot distribution could use   
some work, to give an example, clearing a CP4 should NEVER give anything purple and bellow 40-   
50% stat rolls, same with Heroic/Legendary dungeons. 

&amp;#x200B;

4, Talents and Gear - This is really from person to person, but i think more gear pieces should have   
talents like before, it gave way more build diversity, yes it would make it more grindy to get the   
correct pieces, but it would add more of the variety back, to give an example, if you want to run a 4   
piece green set, but want more complimentary talents, you need to give up the backpack and chest   
slots thus reducing the usefulness of given set by a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

5, Skills and skill damage - First I should clarify, I ran a skill build pre WoNY  and still work now on one,   
but if I compare it to my Rifle/LMG build skill builds feel super underwhelming for some reason, to        
take out a heavy with skills on anything past hard is tedious where as my DPS build just melts   
them.

To give you an example, my LMG is a god rolled Pestilence, it crits for 500-600K On headshots and   
about 300k on body shots, lets say, half of my mag crits, that is an avg. 21mil on a mag, reload and   
you can go again. 

My Mortar turret hits for about 3.2 mil, its AoE and is generally awesome, thing is, its slow AF,   
Heavies love to smash them, its a legit PITA to aim and a lot of enemies just roll out. Next one,   
Stinger Hive, mine hits for about 1 mil, 18 charges = 18 mil at best, is non movable, yes, you can use   
the exotic backpack to extend its range quite a bit, and it makes the hive just pure awesome, but,   
once you are out of charges, tough luck.

&amp;#x200B;

6, Specializations - I have quite the gripe with this.  I think they need more work put into them ? Extend   
skill trees ? More branching trees ? Better synergy  with their corresponding Grenades ? Just make   
them more interesting ? 

&amp;#x200B;

fq169q,Sabbathius,Dead Massive: RE Polarity Switch,"Having finished the Polarity Switch event, and generally enjoyed it, I'd like to make a few suggestions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Make this event an optional toggle that is permanently available, similar to Directives, toggled from world map. So that when the event ends, we can still use it. It makes no sense to put all this work to implement an event that only runs a week. Learn from Kenly College, and actually make better use of the content you already expended resources on creating. 
2. Increase the damage bonuses per stack to be higher than they are now, to make toggling this mode more attractive. During the event, exotic cache is appealing, but the rest of the time the damage boost alone, the way it is now, is too weak to make it an attractive choice.
3. For this and future challenges, make them less grindy and niche, and more organic and fun. Killing negative polarity enemies with headshots was decent enough, and could be done organically as part of regular gameplay. Just tone down the requisite number of kills for people who have lives. But killing negative polarity enemies with weak point kills was a bloody drag, not just mechanically bit also in the number of kills (50?). Too many of these were utterly trivial in Story mode with mission resets/suicides, and too few could be completed organically via application of player skill in a REASONABLE amount of play time. It could still be done, but the time it would have taken would have been extreme.
4. Make sure we can use it consistently in co-op multiplayer. It's really tiresome to have it enabled and doing a mission, and having someone join and the whole thing switches off. Which is what happened to me today, I was 5/8ths done with a stronghold, only for someone to join and turn off the polarity. If I have it on, NOBODY should be able to turn it off but me. It shouldn't turn off because someone joins my group, or I join theirs.

All in all, I actually really enjoy the mechanic, and I would love it if it would stick around. The same principles above should be applied to upcoming events also. These should be enjoyable, not torturous.",3,1585329799,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fq169q/dead_massive_re_polarity_switch/,thedivision,2

fpziag,Coilspun,Darkzone Rifle Dominance,"Hi all,

I thought that we might see less M1A Rifle dominance in the DZ in the days following the patch, but even with the reduction in PvP damage the rifle is still the go to weapon - it's almost pointless using other weapons, which is sad, I've not found any of the issues really bothering me since WoNY short of the extraction FPS drops and server instabilities - the lack of a point to building in a different direction to CHC, CHD, Fox's Prayer, Contractors Gloves and an LMG/Rifle combo is really killing diversity.

I've got a shredding SMG, CHC, CHD build, but even with a high RoF SMG with 60% CHC and 154% CHD, Strained, Clutch build I can't out shoot a semi-competent M1A user.

Not really a complaint and I can make it work, sometimes, but the building is suffering for it and don't get me wrong I run the same build (can't beat 'em join 'em mentality)

I’ve played plenty of looter shooters, from Borderlands to Destiny. Is this game any different from those? Just follow missions and gather gear? How intense is this game on making a build and min-maxing, or can you play more however you’d like and with what you find fun? What should I look for in the beginning? Do I need to play with friends or can everything be solo’d besides for endgame? What even is endgame in this game? I would assume there are raids as this is a AAA studio RPG game, but are they similar to D2? Lastly, I’ve heard mixed things about the game, downloaded it for free from EGS the other day. Is it even worth it to get into it and start fresh right now?

fpzcwo,Flyinghipp0s,"This game isn't balanced for solo players, and that's a good thing","I have been seeing so many people on this subreddit complaining about how this game isn't balanced properly and that there is only one build option to take on the higher difficulty content. While I agree there is only one build to efficiently complete solo heroic and solo challenging, its because an all red damage build should be the most efficient at all of that content. Look at any other ARPG where you have different kinds of builds, Like Diablo 3, there is a reason why people make farming builds that are straight DPS builds. It's because they do a lot of damage and clear content quickly. In no world should an all blue tank build, or an all yellow skill build clear heroic or challenging content in this game as quickly as an all red damage build. If you want to play a support build you should be looking to play in a group where build diversity thrives. With that said you still will need someone in that group with a damage build otherwise you will still run into the issue of doing no damage. This game was easy to play when TU8 came out and is only easier after 8.4 because of all of you complaining about how you want to do all of the content with any build in the game. That's not how this game is balanced and you need to understand that.

Now onto the loot from higher difficulties. You should't be getting all god rolled gear from challenging or heroic content all the time. If you want to take on the difficult content in this game you need to get the gear for it and it shouldn't take a couple hours of playing to get everything you need to take on heroic content. I see so many people complaining about getting terrible loot but guess what you do still get good enough gear to take on the next difficulty. Heroic and challenging weren't meant for everyone. When people say to optimize your build they aren't saying that to make you mad they are saying that because the gear you are using isn't great and that you should be looking for upgrades to help you take on the more difficult parts of the game. I like to inspect other players I see in the safe houses and I can tell from most of their gear that they are no where near optimized to take on heroic content and that's fine, but not using a good build is going to make this game more difficult.

I just wish people realized that this game isn't designed to be a solo player game. While you can play it solo and do all the content in the game(besides the raid), you need to put in the time to get a build that can take on this game solo. Unfortunately that does require a damage build to complete most of the solo content in this game.",25,1585324495,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpzcwo/this_game_isnt_balanced_for_solo_players_and/,thedivision,0

With experience I’ve come to realize that if there is another low DPS team member (pure healer or pure tank or even another fellow CC) it just doesn’t work because the total group DPS doesn’t cut it (I play exclusively on heroic). 

I simply drop from the matchmake at the beginning (not halfway thro lol) so they can add another player.

fpximr,DeangeloGraves,Our experience of the game.,"I've been playing Division 2 since launch before that I played Division 1 a few months before the sequel came out. 

I'd like to think my game knowledge of both the mechanics and inner-workings of the game is top-notch. I had the privilege to play with some of the top raiders and community members in the game to learn how they saw and played the game. 

So perspective shifted dramatically when I learned to refocus and look at the game a different way. 

I'm saying all of this because I want to get to my point very clearly without missing any key details. 

When Division 2 started I was really happy with the game. It was finally the moment I had a chance to play a shooter with ""MMO"" elements. I liked the style of ""real world guns"" and not space guns like Destiny 2. However, there were bugs and a few things about the game that made it difficult at first. But as I went through the game and learned the new mechanics and developed a strong grasp of the game. I was able to put a great build together and learn how to play the game effectively. 

Where is this leading to my point? Hold on. I'm getting there. 

My friends started playing the game with me when the Division 2 was on sale and picked up the expansion pack. They all complained to me at how the recoil was bad, that there was overwhelming content, what builds should I use, and why am I not doing enough damage, the enemies are so hard to kill, etc. They all asked me ""How are you carrying us solo in Heroic?""

I told them it's simple. Just keep playing the game and learn the mechanics that will help you complete missions efficiently. They listened to me and asked questions that lead to answers instead of leading them into anger. 

Friend: ""Hey, what's a good build if I want to play sniper?"" 

Me: ""Headshot Damage with a mix of Crit Hit Damage/Chance. White Death is good but SVD with a Crusader shield is great. Always hit the head. Try and get Contractor Gloves and Fox Prayers. It's multiplicative damage""

Once my friend got it. He was able to solo Heroics very well. I told him as he was picking up gear to not be discouraged if the rolls you need aren't coming through. I told him chances are a 2% damage upgrade will be harder to find than a 20% damage upgrade. So keep farming and it will drop. 

Another friend asked me about the polarity event. ""Ugh how do you XYZ that seems so difficult and tedious."" or ""I have to kill 50 negative polarity enemies through weakpoints...how many black tusks are like that?""

I had to tell him that the best place to farm that is the Federal Emergency Bunker. The ""suicide bomber tunnel"" is the perfect place as a kill via their chest will count as a kill towards that challenge. Just do it on challenging and kill yourself over and over in the tunnel and you'll be able to complete it in 10 minutes. Once that specific challenge is done, complete Federal Emergency Bunker (since it's on challenging) and you'll complete the other challenge within that day. 

He completed Day 3 of the challenges in an hour by looking at the game differently and being efficient. He only has 20 hours of the game played. 

So the point I'm trying to get at it is...aside from the obvious ""complaints"" or feedback from the community on bugs and balances. The mechanics of the game are easy and if you know enough about the game it will become easier and more fun to play. 

A community member on Reddit asked one time the question. ""How do you know if a named item is good?"" I replied, well play the game and you'll know if it's not good or not. You'll never know until you put it through a bit of trial and error. 

Example: I didn't realize MG5 with Fast Hands with a crit build will increase my DPS over other talents. I had to test it out and I loved it.

I’m not interested in skills or skill based play as most of my clan run skill/healer builds and I am looking to add DPS to the clan. Problem is I have been out of touch with the game for a while and there are so many more talents available now. 

What I really want is if someone could tell me which one/two/three piece sets I need to be grinding for and with which talents on them. 

I’ve heard rifles are the way to go now, will these put down enemies quicker than say with an LMG or AR build?

Title Update 8 and following brought nothing but headache and frustration. I will not be arrogant and think that I speak for the overwhelming majority of the fan base. However, due to the comments read on reddit, on YouTube creator channels, the game was broken too much. I don't remember buying this game for an experience similar to Dark Souls. Respect and a lot of those who prefer bigger challenges, but there is no way to even think about playing in bigger difficulties with the current difficulty model, even after 8.4.

&amp;#x200B;

Stupidity carried out by the developers in their laziness, stupidity or mania of wanting to rush everything aim of money resulted on:

\- Absence of balance;

\- Removal of talents from masks, holsters, gloves and knee pads;

\- Destruction of the talents of exotic weapons (exceptions being sweet dreams and pestilence);

\- absurd focus in cooperative mode while sacrificing players who wish to play solo;

\- Restriction of variability;

\- Absence of ability to create builds focused on blues;

\- Lack of creativity in activities;

Right I know my outfit is not deserved, nor the Bighorn drop. And I did farm the Bighorn for all clan members like crazy - we failed doing so (and thus I realized that 10% exotic and 5% Bighorn is WAY too short, plus with the league, how making at least 1 Bighorn drop locked behind goals like doing each Legendary 3 times, killing X enemies while under status effect etc).

We know that M4 is god tier and that’s ok. But Carbine 7 is not far away from it. 

But my theory crafting concerns mostly when none of the guns have max rolls. What is then best ?

To calculate this I am contemplating to do the following:

1. Calculate the base dmg potential. This is basically: bullet dmg X RPM yes? Then I get the dmg it can do within 1 minute yes?

2. Then I need to see what stats I have. I will then multiply the bullet dmg with the % I have in weapon dmg stat yes? And then recalculate based on point 1 yes?

Or you are going toe-to-toe with a veteran npc and have his health at like 1% and you just know you can finish him... but wait, he turns on the high velocity ammo and just wrecks you, or all his buddies target you.

I am sure that sometimes it just feels this way, but the AI definitely knows how to prioritize a target, which I appreciate for the most part. But I gotta say, sometimes I feel like I am playing against a hive-mind or omniscient being rather than a bunch of well trained soldiers.

There are plenty of other instances this rule gets applied. I just wanted to mention a few.

I basically want to have the same information I'm getting for the attributes, i. e. some kind of progress bar that tells me if a weapon has the maximum possible damage values or if it's trash. 

I picked up some assault rifles and don't know if it's even worth keeping as I don't know the damage range. Where can I see this?

If it's not visible withing the game, is there a reliable external source in the Internet?

On a side note: I think I heard somewhere that exotics always have the max damage value when they drop. Is this true?

fpuwa9,Trotski7,Yaknow.. dying in what is practically one hit just makes me wish for a realism mode.,"It's so easy and quick to die in this game. Sometime I die within maybe 1/2 (or fuck, even less) a second. And yet I can freeze and enemy in place with a riot foam and then shotgun them in the head from 1in away 20+ times and not kill them.

It just makes me wish for a realism mode. Everything, including you and enemies, die in singular hits. Headshots being extremely effective. Armor kits being extremely scarce and taking long to use mid-combat. Ammo being restricted and ammo refill stations also rare (maybe 1 or 2 per mission). Grenades being more effective but you can only hold 2 at a time. Special ammo also being more rare but highly effective. And so on.

If my enemies can blow my head off in 1 hit through 1mil + armor, why shouldn't I be able to do the same to them? It would also make enemies like armored minigunners way more deadly and IMO more interesting to fight; their armor is really thick and resilient so they wouldn't just die in 1 headshot. Bosses could be more fun to, they could get a little extra armor. And it would also promote much more teamplay and cover usage in every way, because cover-to-cover would be way more effective and useful. Skills would probably need to be balanced in many ways for this mode such as needing longer cooldowns or maybe just less charges over all.

It's just frustrating and annoying sitting there unloading mag after mag after mag, practically regardless of build or weapon or difficulty setting, into enemies who just face-tank everything while slowly walking toward you to fuck you up in barely half their mag. It would just be fun to be able to dish out the same kind of punishment too.

And if they didn't want to make it an entire mode maybe they could just do it as a weekly rotation as part of the invasion? Maybe 1 or 2 missions per week that have the option to be played on realism mode for extra EXP or a special loot drop or something.",5,1585306307,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpuwa9/yaknow_dying_in_what_is_practically_one_hit_just/,thedivision,1

* **Eliminate 5 positive followed by 5 negative polarity hostiles**

For the above 2 challenges, I was doing them in tandem with Day 3 ""kill hostile via weak points"" and followed this guide:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpjz23/polarity\_weakpoint\_farm\_around\_2\_weakpoint\_kills/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpjz23/polarity_weakpoint_farm_around_2_weakpoint_kills/) , hence I did them in Pathway Park. That, while making sure not to accidentally shock myself (if it happens, the counter resets to zero)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Eliminate positive polarity Outcasts**
* **Complete Stronghold (Hard difficulty or higher)**
* **Eliminate negative polarity hostiles with Specialization Weapon**

For these 3, I did them in Roosevelt. I was using Gunner Spec weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Eliminate 10 positive polarity Black Tusk with grenades.**

Note that the Demolisher nade launcher does **NOT** count as a grenade. You need to use hand grenades. I recommend **Concussion grenades**  as they deal the most damage. I also recommend equipping **Foam Launcher** to keep the hostiles in place so you can land your grenades accurately. Best place to do this IMO is Tidal Basin on Story difficulty.

That's it! I'm sure there are easier methods, but with the above I managed to clear Day 4 challenges in a little over 1.5 hours.

fptecy,LoucheLouche,A couple builds to make the polarity event fun,"**Gunslinger/Versatile**

Since being forced to weapon swap all the time can be annoying, let it work to your advantage. These two talents add 20% extra weapon damage and 10-35% damage amplification when you swap weapons. I've been using it for this event with AR (Ctar w/ Killer) and Rifle (Classic M1A w/ Killer) as I found those to be the more versatile weapons that work well both short, mid and long-range.

The rest of the build is just a normal crit build. \~50% CHC and as much CHD as possible. With the Ctar I've been getting peak hits as high as 960k at 900 rpm when the talents and the event damage buff are up at the same time.

**Bolt Action Sniper**

This event is perfect for sniping. When sniping you plan your shots more anyway, so this event is essentially just a free damage buff. I normally hit 10-11 million headshots with M44s, but with this event, I'm getting peak damage at 17-19 million when the damage buff is maxed.

For a good sniper build you want to have headshot damage everywhere, don't worry about crits. 3-pc Aces is a must, Fox's Prayer kneepads, Airaldi backpack with Vigilance, and a chest that is one of the following: perfect glass cannon, glass cannon, focus or 4-pc Aces.

For the MMR, I prefer as much single bullet damage as possible, so White Death with Ranger is my usual choice. Ekim's Long Stick is also good, or just some M44 with Ranger. I've gotten a couple Nemesis lately as well, which used to be my favorite MMR pre-TU8, but I don't think the additional damage is worth it any longer. With M44s you can pre-aim and flick shot when you are aggroed and you can generally fire much faster.

For the secondary weapon, I use the Classic M1A with Rifleman as it works very well with the build above due to Fox's Prayer, Sharpshooter spec, and just generally being specced into headshot damage. Even though this is my close-range weapon for this build I use it with the CQBSS scope for additional headshot damage, but it can be hard to get used to. I'm comfortable with it even when enemies are up close, but many players seem to prefer a non-scoped sight.",2,1585297848,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fptecy/a_couple_builds_to_make_the_polarity_event_fun/,thedivision,1

fpt6yo,GnawtyBeans,Is it long enough? It doesn’t feel long enough...,"Hello,
I’ve only returned back to the game 3 weeks ago. Had been gone quite a few months and seeing all the goodies and promises of the new patch I figured I’d give the game another try as I did love it but got frustrated with having to rebuild every week. 

Since being back I’ve completed NYC and obtained level 120 SHD. It’s been great. What I am wondering about is the Leagues being timed runs in challenging and heroic am I just seriously slow at optimising my gear or is it fair to say that the majority of regular players haven’t HAD the time to run these leagues and complete them in 1 week?

I haven’t been lucky in RNG - I never am in any game lmao 😂 but I missed the first week mostly because of real life issues from the Virus and shut downs and thought I’d TRY with a friend to do the challenges and grab the BP trophy. Fat chance.... we haven’t had time to grind for the gear needed to speed run it and since the most recent patch the NPCs having higher health is slowing us down even more. 

TL:DR My point is...Is 3 weeks REALLY a fair amount of time for Massive to expect the majority of REGULAR players to be min/max with awesome rolled gear to be speed running?

If I am just a baddie then I apologise and will accept the abuse that will come in the replies but it really feels a little unfair - especially with all the bugs we have to wade through as well. 

Like I said I realise we had 2 weeks, I missed most of the first week and my stages didn’t come over to this current week (possibly because I hadn’t maxed out those stages?) in any case I was restarted at 0 and have no chance of hitting 60 stages.

fpt3yn,bausHuck33,The problem causing lack of build diversity and useless mods are the same issue.,"First off, build diversity isn't in a bad spot, it's just not in a great spot. The builds suffering the most seem to be damage builds. Stacking weapon damage, then crit up to cap, then crit damage and hs damage. When possible use damage out of cover and damage to armour. Its basically the same build for every weapon type.

Skill builds are teased with having options in mods but the mods are so scaled down that they are almost not needed. Not to mention they are tedious to work with and sort.

All these issues come from items scaling with levels. It leads to exponential increases. And Massive give very little wiggle room in other places. I assume this system is in place so that anyone at a level can complete content. 

What would be nice to see is bases increase every 10 levels (and they are fairly low), and then we get higher rolled attributes. Having a tier system for the attributes would also help with progress. You could have a tier exclusive to Heroics. 

It's sorta hard to explain without images. And I know that when I say tiers people will think of skill tiers, which is not what I mean. An example would be:
% increased Weapon Damage
T1 (Heroic+): 200-250%
T2 (Challenging+): 150-199%
T3 (lvl40+): 120-149%
T4 (lvl35+): 90-119%
T5 (lvl30+): 50-89%
T6 (lvl20+): 30-49%
T7 (lvl10+): 10-29%
T8 (lvl1+): 1-9%

It wouldn't need so many tiers but it is an example.",1,1585296217,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpt3yn/the_problem_causing_lack_of_build_diversity_and/,thedivision,1

fpsxgp,aXGhost,This is not fun anymore.,"I am starting to realize that I don't have as much fun anymore in this game. WoNY was a great expansion and I believe I got my money's worth so I have no regrets over that. But holy fucking shit has it sucked since and ripped all the fun out of this game. You shouldn't have to fucking exploit the game to have fun in it with damage boosts and all that nonsense. Personally, it does not feel rewarding or fun at all to me. 

 Someone said in a post today that ""the community has no loyalty to the developers, but to the game itself and the series in general and that's what brings them back and make them stick through shit like this"". I couldn't agree more. I used to spend hours in this game and have so much fun each time. I've had some of my best time with both these games. It was something new, something refreshing and FUN. Today, I drag myself in, and can barely spend an hour in the game. It feels like torture. There is nothing FUN to do anymore! Grindy, annoying league challenges? There is no build diversity, it's just one build. It's boring. It's bland. It's NOT FUN. It's sad, really, to see it all unfold and it's nothing we haven't seen before. I'm no game developer, but you can't make games and make the same fucking mistakes on each of them every time, right? 

I've spent a lot of time playing other games for the past couple weeks, just trying to give myself a break from this game. I rather spend my time in Borderlands where I feel rewarded, and powerful! I can easily spend over 8+ hours in that game and have so much fucking fun each time! Division used to be like that. Now it's a fucking slog fest: ""Oh new day, new boring challenges..great...Salute 10 enemies with polarity...Take 20 pictures of positive polarity enemies..."" Really? This has to be the most lazy put together content I have ever seen. Then adding speed run challenges on top? You know, they really seem to push group play and all that, shit on solo players AND YET these fucking challenges don't count for everyone in the group. FUCK OFF! Make up your minds already.

 I've stuck around for probably more than I should've or would've for any other game, but again it's the loyalty we all have for the game, not the developers because they have shown the same fucking thing over and over again for the past 4 years. I am convinced they do little to no testing whatsoever, because no one will sit there, through this slog fest and say ""Hey this is good, they're gonna have a lot of fun with this"". They like developing their game, but playing it, not so much. All of these ""challenges"" and ""events"" don't feel at all like the developers actually tried and wanted them in the game. It feels more like: ""Yeah add it, it's good enough"". I'm sorry, but I wont be part of ""good enough"" anymore. It's insulting, dishonest and disheartening.",143,1585295180,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpsxgp/this_is_not_fun_anymore/,thedivision,1

fpsmak,Fir3Soul,[Q] As a Newbie help me out with some guides,"So i got the game when it was 3 euros (shout at me) but I just got to end game &gt;!is it the end game when Black tusk invade?!&lt;   and really enjoy it and will buy myself the Expansion these days (waiting for my bank account to be topped ) . But I am having a hard time creating a build or seeing a guide on how to play the endgame as a newborn agent. my GS is around 270 and I feel uber squishy (and it's before I even wore the Glass Canon talent on my jacket) . Now with Glass Canon I deal damage and am uber squishy. 

Can anyone like..tell me what to do ? I saw specializations but did not understand how do I get point for it ? I leveled up twice but no points were awarded ? What would be the best Specialization to go with ? 

I have 2 play styles I enjoy. 1 is rush down and shotgun(or SMG, I used to love The Named SMG with Perfect preservation) and lots of armor (that was like the only time I felt indestructible) or Keeping it close-mid range with Rifles and AR's . Got a Mk17 that does wonders and a Police Gun something for the AR part. But I feel that I don't do enough damage..where can I check my DPS and see what kind of DPS would be good for Just me solo Normal end game content ? 

Also considering my two play styles which of the specialization should I get ? 

Or maybe there are other play styles I could try ? I saw this dude once come help me he had a ""status effect build"" in which with a gun he would make enemies on fire, he had the fire turret and one gun would do bleed dmg. 

Also feel free to recommend me a clan (be it yours) which is active..I joined one but I took it from Lev 5 to lev 7-8-9 I think and then more people joined and it's now like lev 15-16. and I never saw the leaders online .

Also for build recommendations  I know this game has exotics but since I only have High end gear let's keep it to that ? or maybe if there's a 100% chance exotic I can do that. 

Also thanks for reading this and sorry for the long post :) .",6,1585293401,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpsmak/q_as_a_newbie_help_me_out_with_some_guides/,thedivision,1

fprqtk,hapki_kb,Exotics aren’t that exotic at all.,"Massive.  I’ve listened to your State of the Games before, and I remember how you stated that Exotics are something special, and should be extremely hard to get. With that I think most people would agree. But now that they roll with varying levels of attributes they sure don’t seem so special at all. In fact they are hardly worth it 99% of the time unless you are one lucky sob and get a decent roll (which is not often). When you told us we had to get the level 40 version of ALL our old lvl 30 exotics, I was one of the few that said fine, I’ll do it.  But now that I’ve spent countless hours and have gotten five level 40 exotics (4 olds and 1 new one) only one of which is a half way decent roll, I am done looking for them. I finally got a Bullet King after running the Tombs so many times I lost count. On Hard and Challenging. I was so excited to see that red plume, but when I got the gun I was punched in the gut. It has absolutely terrible rolls in all three categories.  It’s a Pitiful gun.  And this is an Exotic?  THIS MUST BE CHANGED.  Allow us to recal them or make them have higher rolls.

fprq8q,sh0ckv3l,"Mt second round of feedback: ""my world is 80sq mt"" edition.","Going to be as synthetic as possible. 

* ASSAULT RIFLES 

Headshot damage is useless. Get rid of it.
Spread is over exaggerated.
Too much damage fall off.
Suffer too much from hit detection issues.
Should have better HS multiplier than LMGs

*SMGs:

Same as ARs, high RPMs and poor hit detection.
Too risky to get close to enemies, too inaccurate to play at medium distances.
Damage fall off borderline oppressive.
Spread...really?

*LMG

Slow RoF helps for hit registering puposes.
They are good at all ranges.
Packs in the best secondary attribute of all weapons classes.
Unnecessary high HS multiplier.

*Rifles

M1A classic overtuned much?
Other rifles otoh, feel a bit on the low sides.
Generally well balanced.

*MMR

They simply should hit for more in pve.
Should also have more effective range.

*SHOTGUNS

Pellets spread is too high.
Ultra risky playstyle. 
I feel like pellets have trouble registering, am i the only one?
A barrell/mags mod to swap ammunition from shotshells to slugs cartidges, would be nice.
We need the showstopper!

*GREEN SETS:

Should sport a bigger secondary stats budget. Ie: 10% chc instead of 6, 25% repair skills instead of 20 and so on.
Gloves, holster and masks should have some kind of minor talents attached to them.
Chest and backpacks could use 2 slots for mods.

*SKILL MODS:

They need a significant buff.
As suggested by another redditor, they should have a library on their own.

GEAR MODS:

Should have a library.
WTB &gt;11% PfE mods. Im nerding super hardcore and i only found 5 of them, all of them at 11%.

STATS:

I will never get tired of repeating this: Skill Tier and Armor should passively increase weapon damage a bit.
Protection from Elites should have been a secondary stat.
What's the point of weapon handling?
Not enough stats and recals to spare to have stiff like weapon handling and optimal range as secondary stats.
WH,Optimal rage, Stability and Magazine size should be part of a newly implemented ternary stat slot.
They are minor, might as well to have them fixed and as such,  non able to be recalibrated. 
Skill Tier is horrible.

NAMED GEAR:

They should not roll with maximized, ultra powerful, multiplicative stats like DtA, HSD and DOoC.
They should be like the smg named gloves or the mas that gives 100% haste bonus on pulse. 
Imho named items should be a meaning to come up with creative and effective hybrid build.


GRENADES:

Maybe a small buff, like 1200%, ti make them able to deal some  meaningful damage.
CCs grenade should be available to all speca. Pick one and roll with it.

SKILLS:

Fix Lady Death. Lol.
I should be able to decide whether or not to use the reviver hives's ress.
Artilley turret less cumbersome to use, same the drone bombardier. 
Some skill variants are quite useless.
Damage over time effects should scale  better with skill damage.
Pulse should go back to the div1 version.
Riot Foam should foam mobs that passes into it, not just on impact. Same as the npcs burning one!",3,1585288652,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fprq8q/mt_second_round_of_feedback_my_world_is_80sq_mt/,thedivision,1

Another example is Dolores Jones. Crazy gal and her troops got stuck between Keener's cleaners and us, resulting in loss of countless men as well as her life. If she prioritized strategy, she would have retreated, thus saved herself and her unit.

fpqeju,Menellaus,W.O.N.Y an ENTOMOLOGIST Dream....,"Definitely a good place to start if you are an aspiring Entomologist.

Small bugs,Big Bugs,Medium Bugs.

Some are ""Cute"" some are ""Nasty"",some are ""Disgusting"" and some are like a fly just plain ""Annoying"". 

We have ""Legacy"" bugs those are just part of the experience and fall in the ""Cute"" category Like the sound Bug which migrated due to climate change during the Division 1.

We have ""The Revive Hive Bug""  which has to fall in the ""Nasty"" category since it can completely cause a team Wipe on legendary when it decides to invade a fully optimized group.

We have new species of Bugs that Migrated from BUG infested places like Borderlands,F76 and Anthem. 
Those fall under the Annoying category.

They range from Infinitely long load screens to Infinite loading loops most likely from the bare lands of Anthem.

Than there are the ""Stacking of Talent"" Bug that is here obviously from the Borderlands.

And last but not least ""The DMG BUG"" that right there is one tough Bastard. 
Many Man and Women have tried to stomp,kill,De-Bug and exterminate The DMG BUG to no avail.That one is from the inhospitable land of Bugtesda and F76.
As of right now Agents of Doom are running around with SMG's doing 4 Million DMG and M1's doing 15 Million Dmg.
Plain Awesome......

We have reached the bottom of the barrel The Disgusting Bugs like #%""=%$/DELTA ERRORS ,Lost Progress,Lost Season Pass Items and Glitched enemies preventing mission progress...

Notable mentions are: But aren't actually Bugs Fire,Poison,Gas,Mortar Spam,Bombardier Drone aka (Bep..Bep..Bep..Bep..Bep).

Like, does stealing a person's ultra-rare max-roll Ninjabike kneepads get you off or something?

Because IMO, being rouge kinda makes you an Asshole as you are choosing to want to steal other player's loot.

It's not like normal PvP, in normal PvP no already earned loot is at stake, as it's just loot that's unknown until the match is over.

But in the DZ...it's stuff that you know what is at stake, and if you see a group or a person at the extraction point, you know they know what they have, and you are making the conscious choice of 

""Hey, I 'ma be an asshole""

Is that really the mentality we want to instill or let run free, as that's just textbook toxicity.

fpq5di,Chocoyun,Looking for shotgun builds.,"Hi, your average chocolate bar here. Lately I've been enjoying shotguns a ton, they feel pretty good and can put out a lot of damage. My favorites would be the KSG and named Cuelebre shotguns. Currently running a standard DPS build and it does pretty good, takes around 3 shots to take out a named enemy at the firing range. I couldn't get the mask tonight but I was thinking of a build centered around the KSG and Ongoing Directive gearset. 

So the build goes like this, you want a decent rolled KSG with the talent pummel to refill the mag and grant 40% weapon damage for 10s after 3 consecutive kills. Throw in the Survivalist spec to get 3 shells back for killing a status afflicted enemy. Mixed in with Ongoing Directive every bullet will proc bleed. Basically I hate reloading. So what do you guys think? If you have any shotgun builds I would love to hear them!",24,1585281162,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpq5di/looking_for_shotgun_builds/,thedivision,1

Yes, I've noticed some of the glitches mentioned, but I'm a solo-only player and many (most?) of the issues are group-related.

I'm terribly sorry for you guys that are here posting threads saying the game is broken for you. We all love the game.  If you didn't, you wouldn't be here. That's why those of you that are experiencing issues post those threads - and that's a good thing. Believe it or not, Massive does read these posts.

Hang in there. Massive has said multiple times that they are making INCREMENTAL changes. So it'll take a bit of time to get the game in a good place.

Be patient and keep on playing - just playing helps them - they collect data about how we play so they can make decisions based on our in-game experiences.

Tanks need a reasonable way to achieve status immunity (or close to it). 80%+ hazard protection is not reasonable. They need a taunt to be able to draw enemy fire away from the squishy red builds. It's not fun standing in front of a whole room of enemies with  big \*\*\* shield while the damage dealers get destroyed by snipers/grenades/rushers.

Healers need something to counter the cluster\*\*\*\* that is fire/poison/bleed and the endless barrage of explosions.

Damage dealers need to deal more damage. Way more. If the damage glitch has taught us anything it's that players are craving the power fantasy.

Support builds need more ways to buff their allies in meaningful ways. (Working gearsets would help).

fpo519,Anon232,Is anyone else just actually having fun?,"Boy I feel like I'm the crazy one here looking at all the complaints in this subreddit. Even before the most recent update I had a lot of fun when the WoNY expansion dropped. 

Yes, challenging missions were difficult, but after a while of matchmaking with randoms and farming loot, I put together some builds that made challenging quite a lot easier. I was able to solo challenging with little problems at all.

Now with the latest update, because we seem to kill enemies faster, content has gotten quite a lot easier. As long as you stay safe and make sure you're not exposed, you can pretty much kill most enemies with as little time possible. I solo'd my first heroic mission and completed it in 32 minutes, which I didn't think was that bad for first time.

I think a lot of people are upset at the whole ""oPtIMiZe YoUr BuIld"" thing that goes around a lot here, but the only complaints I see are from folks here who are the loudest about it. If you matchmake with people, you will find people with very competent builds, with very good stats. I saw someone with gear where only 1 piece didn't have god rolled stats. But these people are what make these missions possible.

Yes, I get a lot of people want to play solo, but this game isn't designed for just solo play. Sure you can complete it solo, but the idea is to get you to utilize others who are out there. Use call for backup, or use matchmaking to your advantage and you will find this game to be a lot easier.

My fear is that massive will give in and make this game the cakewalk it was when TU6 came out. I hope to god that doesn't happen.

fpnkhx,l0rdwh4l3,Exotic perfect talent slot,"Due to the current stripped off state of exotic items and rage or disappointment you might feel when it finally drops, but with disappointing rolls, I would really like to see the option where we are able to roll an extra talent or onto exotic items.

Once you aquire an exotic item it would have an empty ""exotic socket"" on top of their exotic talent, which can hold a talent socketed into it.

Weapons can only hold talents which can roll on high end items of the same weapon type. Exotic gear pieces like ninjabike kneepads or coyote mask could hold a chest or backpack talent.

If that is not a stretch too far, I would let perfect talents to be transferred and if thats stil ok I would even let set talents to be rolled on and making the rolled on talent work as a +1 towards set bonuses. Or maybe thats too much fun.

That way Massive dont have to come up with new talents, and would bring some diversity, or maybe even more mess.

fpnhkw,TheEnragedKnight,"The game, right now, is perfectly tuned","... to be unfun, no matter how you play it. 

Regardless of the difficulty you play, you will have a hard time, because all NPCs deal tons of damage. Loot is shit regardless of which difficulty you play.

Play on lower difficulties, game is hard, loot is shit, but you finish faster. 

Play on higher difficulties, game is hard, loot is shit, but it takes longer to finish.

Play the game for the Global Events, game is hard, loot is shit, and now it's a chore. I honestly prefer to work over rushing missions against broken enemies or playing Polarity. It's not fun.

Only builds that feel viable now are full red. Full blue don't deal enough damage, and are only useful in groups with a shield build. Full skill are either useless, because enemies one-shoot your deployables, or as good as a full-red, if you play around with seeker mines and chem lauchers. 

Some talents take too long to trigger (10 to 12 seconds). Can't stick to cover that long because enemies spam grenades.

The balance between challenge and reward isn't there. It's not fun. It's not rewarding. It's just stressful. 

What is the point of playing it, as much as I want to?

fpn8s6,ATRavenousStorm,"Is fairness the issue? Where does the lack of ""Fun Factor"" stem from?","So I've been seeing a lot of feedback about the game regarding balance and the negative aspects of the current TU. The one thing that's really stuck out to me is that the general consensus seems to be ""Fun Factor"" or lack thereof. 

""Fun"" is a pretty abstract thing. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people. The thing I kind of understand from what people have been saying in regards to fun and the current TU is more or less fairness.

Players want to feel like they've got a fair shot at certain aspects of the game. A chance to react to situations. Having various viable builds that are effective. Suitable rewards for their time and effort. Etc. It's not exactly fair to get oneshot by a shotgun at range or have a flamethrower take you down in seconds while you have 1-2m armor from 100m away or be pigeonholed into playing a way that you don't find enjoyable. It's not exactly enjoyable to grind away for a very rare exotic only to have it drop with low stats and no way to improve it other than grind away again, hoping for the best. It's pretty disheartening. It's not fair to have enemies play by different rules than the player. Spamming abilities over and over, taking and dealing HUGE amounts of damage. Being able to heal to full in an instant. 

In short I guess I just wanted to give my thoughts and open a dialog as to what ""it's not fun"" means exactly. I've just been seeing people say ""it's not fun"". What does does ""Fun"" mean to you in terms of the current TU and events? Is it that it doesn't feel fair?

fpn0k2,FatTacoLove,Issues with liberty island...,"TLDR: FIX KEENER PLZ MASSIVE 

So the other night my room mate and I decided to try to find out if keener always drops the grudge or if that's only the first time though... we like a challange and mostly play on heroic but we remembered how hard keener was the first time through the mission so we went for challenging. The mission was easy up until keener makes his appearance.

Problem 1. The missile launcher kept disappearing and reappearing while we were trying to shoot the weak point causing us to fail the mission twice before we were able to kill it.

Problem 2. Since keener is able to disable your skills and hack anything you put out a skill build is not viable against him.

Problem 3. Keener 1 shots you almost every time you poke your head up to shoot him even from all the way across the map.

Problem 4. Keener uses heal skills and armor kits every time you get his armor below half  making him nearly invincible. 
 
And last but not least

Problem 5. There is no way to leave the mission once you're on liberty island causing you to have to reset the game when you get so frustrated by keener 1 shotting you.

In summation please fix this mission... either make him not use as many armor kits and heal skills so he can be killed or allow skills to be used so we can hurt him enough before he is able to heal to finish the mission...",3,1585268518,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpn0k2/issues_with_liberty_island/,thedivision,1

fpmmxd,moonski,In lockdown but barely playing Division 2 because I want to have fun.,"Over the past however many days since Boris Johnson called a lockdown but not a lockdown, I've found a plethora of ways to cure boredom during IRL dollar flu.

I've played Diablo 3, Age of empires 2, Total war, rocket league, Xcom 2, Apex, Bastion, Hades, even fucking destiny 2 for 5 minutes (but jesus fuck what the fuck have Bungie have done with destiny). 

But basically 0 Division 2. Maybe a little over the weekend but each Div 2 session that does get started invariably is over faster than the last. 

I've barely touched our beloved cover-based-also-facetank-loot-but-not-that-much-loot-shooter despite this literally being the perfect time for this game (not talking about the story... well I guess it's relevant but that's not why). 

I should be grinding and playing and ~~wasting~~ grinding days away making builds, gearing up for legendary / heroic invaded missions, invasions (I wish), the raid, end game content whatever that is, ~~kenly college~~ (lol jk).

But I'm not. Why? This game has a fundament problem. It's gameplay loop.

It is an aggregating unrewarding grind with encounters that take long, that end too fast, that are never worth the effort. (sponge, enemy damage, loot.) 

To top it all off, there's no in game reason to endure this loop. What is the real end goal? What are you actually working towards to complete or do? really?

* Sure I could sit and hope for god rolls, so I can finally run, uhm, the same missions *but harder*? I guess? 
* well I could endure the loop to do the raid but I don't even know where to find drops that give you 8 friends who play Div 2 who are raid ready. 
* I could farm new gear? I do need an extra 1% on my kneepads... and gloves. How exciting. But my build melts anyway, melting 1% faster, meh.
* I could max specializations, but why? whats the point really? Also still don't even know if the points are working properly yet. Assume not.
* I could do the ~~time trials, reused open world shit,~~ ""new seasonal content"". But why? The rewards in the battle pass are decent(ish) but again what are they for?
* I could farm NY CPS? well no I can't cause all the enemies assault forces self-isolating.
* I could farm CPS. Well no I can't because I did them all last year, and they haven't reset since.
* I could goto the DZ... woops died again to rogues cause of TTK.
* ~~I could run the underground, survival, incursions~~. oops sorry wrong game.
* I could run the same missions again with designated loot to make my build a bit better? But the drops are shit in missions. Better run CPS. oh no wait I can't cause reason above.
* I could... hmm what could I do? I dunno.
* I guess I could make a new build? 

Speaking of builds.

Lets say, for the sake of argument, that the true end game is builds then. It's not content. It's doing the same stuff differently. That's fine. Kinda like in dark souls the true end game is fashion, and killing stuff looking as fashionable as possible.

(Yes I know you know what's coming) 

The Problem here is:

I have this build right. It goes All red. All CHC CHD. Strained FAMAS and YES YOU GUESSED IT SPORTS FANS an M1A classic.  It melts. it's a great build. Tremendous build. #1 build. Tremendous. Other builds are fake news. Trust me i'm a smart guy.

I mean I also get melted with that build. But when I tried a blue build with tardigrade chest, I got melted and also I didn't melt the bad guys.... 

My bad guy shooting build works very well at heroic. So I don't really want another build. 

 Well, ok that's not quite true. I do want another build. I want like 20 builds. But Massive says uh no you have only yellow (mage) blue (tank) or red (actually kill stuff). That is final. But I dont want to be a tank or a mage. I'd like to be a tanky mage or a magey tank, or even a mage that kills stuff.

I'll just stick with my shoot bad guys kill bad guys build that at least minimizes one part of the bad loop - the sponginess.

Now don't get me wrong, TU7 had the lack of content problem as well, just running the same shit but harder. But. HUGE BUT. That update was fun as hell. It fucking rained loot. It was mostly shit. But it still rained. And the build variety. Boy. The amount of talent combinations on gear, holster talents, man. There was a lot to unpack yes, and a lot in your inventory...  but it was fun. So fun. The most fun. Just needed a recal library and bang.

All I want is it to be fun. Is that too much to ask?

Right now there's no end game really worth farming for, and there's no build variety to farm in lieu of this, and to top it all off the basic loop isn't fun.

fpmle3,kestononline,"Current game state is because in the biggest overhaul of the game, there was no P.T.S. and community testing","I feel like the current broken state of the game, and the rampant exploitation of bugs etc, is partly due to the fact that for an overhaul of the entire gear and talent systems like they did with Gear 2.0 in TU8 there was no Public Test Server.

The community which is the greatest tool massive can use to stress test their mechanics, and things that can potentially be exploited, was not utilized.

Much of the issues we see now, could have been addressed, or balanced well before WoNY hit production. Maybe there might have been some leaked info in spite of NDAs etc, but that would have been the lesser of the two evils.

fpm82k,jdh-123,"My feedback on the Polarity event, a few things I would change.","So I done my 3 days full to get my Exotic, so have some time in to form a decent opinion.
+ Being Able to toggle it on and off is good, allows you to take a break for certain missions.
- I don't like joining a group and being forced into having it on if I have deactivated it, same with when I join a group and it deactivated, surely the matchmaking pool isn't too shallow that they can't afford to split it up?
+ The core gameplay of swapping and managing you charge to get a bigger buff is actually really fun for me, It something i haven't encountered and like it.
- It seems the enemies also get a buff, in a game where you die quick already at times it's too much, would much prefer if this was removed and we can just get more powerful with enemies staying the same. It's a 4 day event, let us have some power fantasy for abit please.
- Related too the previous, its forcing alot of people to just run it on normal, no real reason to run harder.
- Some of the challenges are just annoying, particularly the weak spot today m, its ones like these where you don't play the game as much as farm a certain spot over and over, just not fun, maybe have certain missons or bounties to hunt, something different. 
- Seems like it's kind of beneficial in abit way to run solo, with team kills not contributing then you are losing out big time in a team.
- Probably my biggest issue is a small one, I hate the random changing of charge mid fight, I'm perfectly happy managing my reloads and weapon swaps while being charged down, it's fun and a challenge but when my charge randomly changes without warning its just plain annoying, has caused me to log off a few times, it's just stupid to be mid mag and suddenly I'm shocked and stunned, then dead without warning, just the weapon swaps and reloads changing should be enough.
- Finally I think alot of people may agree the rewards are kind of meh,  aside from the exotic cache theres nothing really worth the grind, especially for those who aren't keen, they may just not bother. Maybe some cool new dyes/emotes/apparel, how about an electrician set? Or maybe a redeemable token for your recal library to max out 1 stat or unlock 1 attribute. 
Feels like it's a similar problem with he season pass where the rewards are pretty lacking, I hope theres more rewards come Season 2 as I don't think I would pay separately for the season pass right now.",4,1585265645,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpm82k/my_feedback_on_the_polarity_event_a_few_things_i/,thedivision,1

fpjy2x,N0ob_C3nTR4L,From a beginner: the game has so much potential but the experience is very rough,"I got the division 2 a few days ago and I really enjoyed the many things about the game such as the excellent cover system, great gun plays and the augmentation that you get from being in a squad with high-level friends. I really enjoyed how the game offers you the chance to sort of catch up with your friends and allowing many different play styles with different skills.   


However, being a Ubisoft game, it is filled with bugs. The ones I encountered caused way too much damage to the experience of the game. For example, the crashes. I've spent 20 hours into the game currently and the game has probably crashed 20 or more times. I've tried many of the fixes online such as changing the paging files but none of it worked. The Ubisoft support team also hasn't responded to a support ticket I sent in a few days ago about this issue but still no response presumably due to lowered staffing from the ongoing pandemic. This bug is an absolute deal-breaker since I can finish the boss at the end of a level but then crash only for me to fight that boss again which has happened to me twice.  


Another bug that was present during my time with the division 2 is the constant freezing and stuttering that I'm getting. The game would freeze for like 2 seconds and then resume (it is also how the crashes occur, the game freezes, backs out of fullscreen to windowed mode and then crashes). It is very annoying since I could be running to cover while NPCs are shooting and I would be stranded in from of their gunfire. This bug also sometimes glitches me into places such as under staircases which I'd have to restart to solve.  


I'm not sure if these bugs happen to everyone or only to a small group of people (hopefully only a small group) but the fact that Ubisoft continues to produce buggy games like this that renders the game almost unplayable is quite a shame.  
I think that the game has quite a good concept and they do deliver on those concepts. It also seems quite successful to me according to [this](http://gamstat.com/games/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/) player count site. I just hope that Ubisoft can start to pay attention to the different game-breaking bugs that might not affect everyone but affect people like me who has to save up and really consider what games. Bugs like these just shouldn't be here at all when people are paying up to 80 dollars to a huge company like Ubisoft.

fpjesh,kasrkin519,I think the division 2 should bring back classified gear sets for endgame build diversity,"If we look at the Division 1, if you're playing DPS, you still could have great build diversity: 

1. Lonestar focusing on super ROF and never reloading 
2. Predator focusing on bleeds 
3. Striker focusing on stacking damage and getting some heals 
4. Alphabridge focusing on synergizing weapon talents together 
5. D3 focusing on a being able to facetank to unload SMG damage into the enemy's face 
6. Multiple sets focused on Marksman's rifles/headshots, etc 
7. Skulls MC gloves for a HE only damage build

And maybe I'm forgetting some others. The point it, even though all those builds were DPS focused, they each each catered to a different strength/playstyle and were unique even while all being focused on damage.

Now, DPS is run all reds with contractor's gloves, fox knees, etc. Maybe you run Yaahl mask or Coyote's. MG5 or M1A. But that's pretty weak for end game diversity compared with we used to have.

I know they wanted to move away from the classified gear sets being the only competitive endgame option like in Div 1, but the present build diversity is so much worse.",7,1585255909,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpjesh/i_think_the_division_2_should_bring_back/,thedivision,0

fpiypb,Z3RO77,Bleed/Burn in PvP is too strong please fix Massive or Redstorm,"Please make this a big post. Recently, I have been playing conflict and dark zone. All conflict and darkzone is stringer hive/firestarter/seeker mine or one-shot while climbing a rope. I have 1.6mil armor will 50% hazard and 49% Bleed and I still die to one explosive seeker mine or fire. Plus the new exotic, Imperial Dynasty, makes a full team of 3 or 4 unkillable causes of massive crowd control. Additionally, the server lag plus hit registration makes running a gun build pointless. A team of 4 always beats a solo player or team of 2 unless they are massively skilled with the perfect aim which is not most of the player base.

Another issue is the gear in the Darkzone, most of it is dropping at 9% weapon damage or 90k armor, making more gear not even worth extracting. I do not mind the rate of drops but the quality does not feel rewarding, does not feel ""Oh I must extract this and keep it safe"". It feels like I am running a herd/challenging mission with my friends.

This is supposed to be a gun game with skills to help but has turned into a CC/sit and wait/one-shot rifle build PVP game. I did think DZ was a little strong but just give up better quality thats all I ask please. I love this game but they need to fix these issues or at least address they are a problem.

fpiuoc,Pizzamorg,What is everyone's thoughts about how casual friendly this first season is?,"What killed my love for Destiny 2, more than anything else, was when it decided to double down on making the 1% happy over all else. 

Streamers complained they could complete a whole expansion in a day and Bungie listened. It became an Ungodly grind to do anything in that game and it became more and more like a mobile game with your managing of dozens of variants of currencies to do anything. 

So in that regard, I like how forgiving this game is around my time. I like that I could easily do everything I needed in a weekly reset in just a couple of hours, if that is all I had to spare. I think this is a good thing. I hate when games become a boys club exclusion zone.  

However, I am still concerned by just how easy everything is to complete, too. I probably play more than average, but I still also have a full time job and I've managed to finish the season pass with nine and a half weeks remaining. I finished the league over one and a bit weeks, without any focus on it at all. I didn't end up doing half of the challenges and getting middling ranks on the ones I did do. 

And sure we have other events, manhunts and leagues coming but I kinda feel like I have sorta *completed* Division 2 at this point, which I feel like I shouldn't be able to feel with a ""Live Service"" game. 

I have filled most of my recall library with God rolls, I have four builds I am happy with now. Other than chasing incremental stat upgrades, there really isn't a lot left to do. 

Now I'm not saying you do a Destiny and suddenly tune your whole game to be centred around people who play like 60 plus hours a week but maybe do it slightly differently? 

I mean given the nature of the rewards in the pass, could they maybe introduce the option to reset these maybe? To give us a constantly cycling goal? Just any illusion of progression, to keep us grinding.

Higher tier pulse jammer also does not include an increase in skill damage, so that's another reason to believe that skill damage may not improve jammer pulse's damage.

fphz5n,No_Man_Divided,The Community and The Game,"While the game is now actually heading in the right direction with the recent TU 8.4 update, there are of course many other things to be fixed. But, right now, this community isn't helping.

Right now, it seems that most people are forgetting that the game is a grinder game and ultimately attempting to be a tactical shooter. In many cases, the ""tactical"" part fails to show due to how the AI behave among other various issues. But, good players always find a way to deal with them. While we give legitimate feedback and criticism, it would help if many of us didn't keep crying like children. Right now, everybody should focus on learning the mechanics and improving their playstyle while the devs take our feedback.

Whether you're a solo player, co-op player, DPS build, etc., you simply must suck up your pride and do things you wouldn't normally do to succeed in-game. The whole point of a challenging game is to get you out of your comfort zone and test your intelligence/skill.

**1) To all these people complaining about loot quality:**

It's as simple as this, you're not playing on a higher difficulty; and higher difficulty TENDS to drop higher quality items. IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE HIGHER QUALITY ITEMS, for you participation award cravers. IT TENDS TO DROP MORE COMMONLY, THE GAME DOESN'T GIVE YOU ITEMS BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT THE GAME. That goes without saying, the gear you farm in one difficulty is meant to help you tackle the next difficulty.

**2) The content is too hard:**

Even prior to the TU 8.4, where enemies NEARLY ALWAYS one-shot you, there were/are varieties of builds that allow you to deal with them. Skill builds that let you spew out seekers, one-shot with the turret, etc.; DPS builds that basically 2-3 shot enemies with rifles; and so much more.

You can also literally abuse the mechanics of the game to your advantage too, spamming status effects to suppress them, disrupting their actions by throwing explosives, use environmental sources, cover-to-cover ALL THE TIME for the damage resistance buff, etc.

There are SOOOOO MANY videos and guides online to making proper builds and doing things. Literally ask all the good players what they do, and they will tell you how to do it.

**3) Solo/co-op:**

Let's face it, this game is a goddamned co-op game. You're not Rambo, the Terminator, Master Chief, and whatnot... you're an unnamed agent that was deployed with several hundreds of thousands of other unnamed agents to work together. If you can't play co-op, you'll just have to be smarter on your own, and it's you who made that choice, not the devs. But, if you want the best gear in the game, you're going to have to work with other people and make friends. The game was marketed as a ""shared-world looter,"" not as a ""your-world looter.""

I am a solo player myself, but I do co-op (part of a very active clan), because it's the most efficient way to get the higher-quality loot I want so I can do things solo lmfao.

**4) RNG being a problem for Exotics:**

Okay, this one is interesting, because the RNG for the weapon itself is fine with 1-7% drop rates whcih is pretty fair for the OP exotics available. HOWEVER, the real problem is when we jump that RNG hump and obtain the weapon or gear, the exotics still have another RNG hump of attribute variation on them WHICH IS WRONG.

Back to the original point, the drop rates themselves are not that bad because most of the exotics are extremely powerful IF USED PROPERLY. Anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't know how to read or play the game lol.

Ex: It's possible to damage-tick for +1 mil per tick with the Pestilence to a target that can't even hit you.

Ex: The Eagle Bearer basically turns you into the Terminator upon procing off a headshot kill.

Ex: Tardi Grade Vest gives everybody in the raid the unbreakable talent.

Ex: The Chameleon basically allows crit-hit AR builds to shred if they stay on target.

**5) Unique Gear Locked Behind Content:**

There's a reason why that gear is good, but whoever said it was going to be easy to obtain it? People are going to have to refine their gameplay and builds if they want a chance at obtaining the uniques. Also, completion of this difficult content definitely shows you have what it takes to wield that juicy gear.

Considering the damage glitches that were recently abused by a significant portion of the playerbase, these exotics are basically useless in their hands, because many of them simply don't have the skill to use them properly. If you didn't do the raid properly or can't handle a legendary mission, what makes you think you have what it takes to wield the EB properly?

**6) The Devs:**

Guys, relax. The devs are trying their best to apply what you want to the game, but the problem is the REAL issues keep getting drowned out by the thousands of whiners on these forums. That being said, it does not AT ALL EXCUSE management from the fact that they focused on the damage glitch first over the other longtime issues due to it making farming the harder content easier. Allow the people who are more well-versed at the game to be heard, because we've taken the time to find and EVEN SOLVE the problems in the game; we know the ins-and-outs of the game having suffered through the BS because a lot of us do love the game. Sadly, many of us quit, because the devs continue to prioritize the whiners over us. If the devs do listen to our suggestions, the game would be universally loved for sure.

\*\*\*If anything, my friend suggested an easy temporary fix to the current damage glitches... just disable the use of turrets lmfao, plain and simple.",16,1585251199,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fphz5n/the_community_and_the_game/,thedivision,1

Feels like everybody else has giant health bars and mine is flimsy and weak, but when I check out other people's loadouts they aren't that different which confuses me so much.

Not sure if I should roll extra crit chance instead of health or just leave one blue and roll 15% WD instead. I'm at 40.8% chc for m1a and 45.8 for lmg without the coyotes procs. More times than not you'll get the middle proc for 10% crit chance taking me up to 50.8% for m1a and 55.8% for lmg, so don't know what's more beneficial to me, extra 5% WD or 6% Crit chance. All of my gear pieces stacked into WD, all mods stacked to crit damage. Total CD at 118% atm. So I see three options

1. Roll crit chance instead of health,
2. Roll higher WD,

It should not feel that easy. It’s called challenging; there should be at least some resistance happening there.

Heroics should be the step up when you are ready to push your skills(s) and build(s). And Legendary should be the ultimate difficulty for the most seasoned and min-maxed of players

fpfvem,waktivist,"The terribad console casual's build to make the game playable again. Or, how I learned to stop throwing controllers across the room and love tank builds.","**What is this build?**

* Spec: Gunner (alternatives: Survivalist, Demo)
* Gear: True Patriot (4), Golan / Gila (2)
* Rolls: All Blue (favor Hazard Protection where available)
* Mods: Protection from Elites
* Weapons: LMG + Steady Handed / Rifle + Lucky Shot
* Skills: Bulwark Shield / Banshee Pulse

**Why should I run a tank build?**

I won't discuss the many, many things going on the game right now that brought me around to this build, because they all have been covered by others already in many other threads. Suffice to say, if you are reading this it's probably because the game feels more frustrating than fun for you right now, and you're looking for a build that can make it good again.

This is the build that I wind up going back to whenever I run up against stuff that just pisses me off, and I'm tired of being frustrated and annoyed. I won't promise that it will make the game feel fun again. It won't. It can be mind-numbingly slow and tedious to play. But it will save you from throwing the controller across the room after your fifth respawn just trying to clear a stupid CP3.

**What gear do I need to run this?**

None of this needs to be ""optimized"" for the build to work. The minimum you need are six blue pieces, four of which are True Patriot. Beyond that, getting the chest and back for the TP set are the highest priorities, and, second to those, the Steady Handed (LMG) and Lucky Shot (rifle) talents are not mandatory, but are very helpful. The rest you can adjust and reroll as you are able, once you have the basic setup going.

The basic build is simple: Gunner spec, True Patriot 4-set, other pieces Golan / Gila, an LMG with Steady Handed, a rifle with Lucky Shot, Bulwark Shield, and Banshee Pulse. I like the Stoner LAMG, but the M249 also is nice. They are not the current meta LMGs like the Negev, but I find that one too hard to control with my shitty aim, especially with a controller. You can use any sidearm, whatever hits the hardest. I just use the Gunner class pistol and it's fine.

If you don't have Gunner spec filled out yet, you also could roll with Survivalist for a little extra protection from elites, a decent pistol, and not much else. You get Survivalist maxed for free on a boosted character. You also could roll Demo for the 20% fire protection. When you can get it, Gunner brings more synergy with the ammo bag and mag size buffs and armor on kill. Little extra weapon handling when parked also helps, I guess.

Everything is rolled blue on all pieces, and wherever I rerolled I took Hazard Protection. Mods all are Protection from Elites. Guns I fit the Large Pouch and +stability mods all around. That gives me capped stability bars on both weapons (a huge help for poor aim), 50% protection against all hazards, and 33% protection from elites. I have around 1.4 million armor and 13 million shield HP.

You can get all of these numbers higher with better rolls, but it works well even with low stats and lousy rolls. I got all of my gear from playing solo on normal and hard with some occasional challenging missions and bounties through random matchmaking.

**What about exotics or named pieces?**

If you happen to have them, people seem to like Pestilence for LMG based tank / support builds, and the Liberty Pistol is amazing for the shield heal, but I don't have either yet. If you do have them, you're probably not someone who needs this guide anyway.

Bullet King is another obvious choice; the Stoner + Large Pouch + Steady Hands is just a bargain bin knock off version of the BK.

The Coyote Mask (from Season One at level 35) probably would be the best single piece swap out if you feel that you're in no danger of dying and want to trade for more damage. It's also easy to get even for casual players right now since you just have to level up the season pass.

Also in the season track (level 57?) is Baker's Dozen, which is the named M1A with Perfect Lucky Shot; probably the ideal rifle for this setup once you get it.

If there is a good named LMG out there with Perfect Steady Hands, I haven't run across it yet.

EDIT: As suggested by /u/NotOneOfThoseFurries, the Tardigrade exotic chest is excellent, and Pointman (named Gila Chest with Perfect Vanguard) may be more useful with the team armor share and brief shield invuln than the faster debuff stacking from the TP chest.

**What is so great about this build?**

First, full disclosure: You will take an idiotically long time to kill anything with this build when solo on account of the low damage. That is what is not great about it.

However, it has a few unstoppable advantages that can get you through almost any situation. And it is the nearest thing I've found to getting back the TTBK we had in TU7 and letting you face most enemies on your own terms and react to problem spawns with fewer surprise one-hit kills.

The first big advantage is the gigantic mag on the Stoner (325 rounds, more if it rolled with +mag size), which combined with Steady Handed means you can just hold down the trigger forever and as long as you hit at least 1/3 of shots you will literally never run out of ammo. This is because (and maybe this is bugged, I'm not sure), when Steady Handed ""refills"" the mag, it doesn't consume ammo from your store. It just magically gives you ammo for free, as long as you hit enough shots so that you never need to reload.

This ""free ammo"" perk, along with the ammo bag buff from TP, is a life saver whenever you happen to random into a mission or bounty with someone who has the otherwise annoying ammo hoarder directive on. Ammo is a non-issue with this setup because you hardly consume any and rarely need to reload. Lucky Shot doesn't give you endless ammo, but at least misses are free when spamming with poor aim, which is something I do a lot when I can't figure out what else to do.

The second is the constant armor heal from the TP White buff. This sadly is bugged at the moment and doesn't heal allies who shoot your targets, but it does heal you, and it will let you face tank quite a bit of damage as long as you can sustain fire and hit at least some shots.

Finally, you have the massive shield which can can hold up even against the idiotic fire axe shield rushers and cleaner flame tanks. You can still go down under sustained fire from a whole room full of elites or heavies, but most times when shit goes sideways, just popping the shield and spamming pistol shots will at least give you enough time to get things back under control.

With the volume of grenade / drone / melee / heavy / rusher / suicider spamming in the game right now, this is the one build I have found that I always can rely on to give me a chance of surviving anything that the game throws out. It won't save you from dipping your toe in poison or fire. But it will give you a chance to react, most of the time.

It's also not the worst build to bring to groups since you can draw fire and pour out continuous debuffs and suppressing fire, which can help to pull through with a group that is struggling. The pulse also is helpful and easy to aim wide area CC that usually actually works. I also don't see other tank builds often in random groups, since so many have flown to the all red meta.

Other builds will kill things hella faster. But my experience has been that my nicely tweaked (and sometimes fun) red / yellow builds really only work when you can dictate range and position, which in the state of the game right now is not possible in most fights, most of the time.

It doesn't bring back the lower pre-expansion TTK; in fact your low damage makes that part feel even worse. But it's the least worst build I have found that can take on any encounter out there and (probably) live to tell about it.

It can be super boring to play especially solo, but at least it lowers the stress enough that you can still play, and feel like you're getting somewhere. Slowly.

fpeo3o,KaufmannGhost,"Make game fun, not hard","**Make game fun, not hard**

Like me, a lots of other agents are looking to have fun playing the game. When i come home after the job or the school, i want to relax. I deal with a lots of problems all day, i don’t want to feel weak and have hard time. I want to feel strong and in control. I’m not looking for a challenge when i play the game. The life is already a challenge. I play the game for the unique ambiance and the exploration.

Here is a list of what i think is the most frustrating for me in the game at the moment.

**The damage** 

The NPC do too much damage in all difficulty. I think the difficulty as to be taken in globality. It's the sum of everything. Not only the damage of NPCs. It’s the grenade, the drone, the wardog, the bleed, the fire, the explosion, the poison, all this thing happen too often and happen at the same time.

Solution : Lower everything that make damage. Less grenade, drone, wardog, bleed, fire, explosion, poison.

**The exotics**

Most of the time, they are bad and the drop are too random.

Solution : They have to be always godroll or give us a way to reroll them. Increase the drop rate or make quests to get them.

**The NPC armor** 

In some case and at some difficulty, NPCs are too long to kill. 

**Activities**

I like to have more quick and easy activities/projects in the game. For example, take 3 controls point or kill 50 Black Tusk. This small activities can be a part of a big project to get a unique reward.

Otherwise I like the game, but for the moment the damage of the NPCs really cause lot of frustration for me. It’s not fun.

I have very exotic that was previously offered and I did them doing things I really didn't enjoy, like raids, (hard for lone players, some dude felt pity for so they invited me to their group) If any thing the stealing of those rewards from us will break this game.  MAKING PEOPLE GRIND MISSION AFTER MISSION TO GET SOMETHING IS STUPID!!!!  All it does it burn people out on the missions.  Get the gun then never return to the mission you actually needed it for but now, nah,  its boring.  Are you telling me you folks can't figure this out.

Give us our blueprints to upgrade our exotics. TODAY, then maybe we can just play,  PLAY!!!

fpdrvc,SgtHondo,Comprehensive Guide to completing Global Event: Polarity,"Below are some tips and tricks to easily completing the Polarity Global Event. I'm having a lot of fun with the event and you can basically speed run everything with the 2x damage modifier from the max polarity stacks. I will update with day 4 tips tomorrow.  
  
**General tips: Gameplay**  
  
Don't be afraid to drop the difficulty if you want. I did this all on solo heroic with little issue but yeah do whatever works for you. I also did this almost all at either the Ivy Tunnel control point, which you can now RESET AT WILL in the manhunt screen, and the DCD HQ mission. You can also smoke your previous records for the League with the double damage active almost constantly.    
  
**General Tips: Loadouts (DPS, Skill and Tank options):**  

DPS: I find it easiest to use two of the same/similar weapons and just switch between the two. It's best to use something that's all around solid (like LMGs or Rifles, for example) rather than, say, one long/one short range weapon like you usually would. I've been running double M1A for the entire event. Basically one or two shotting every single enemy at solo heroic difficulty with x5 polarity, and just switching weapons and/or reloading depending on polarity.  
  
Skill: If you have a solid skill damage build, that's great because you don't get shocked for damaging the opposite polarity with skills! I have a perfectly optimized chem launcher/fire sticky build that made things pretty easy and never had to worry about getting shocked. Also a CC build (BLINDER FIREFLY IS RIDICULOUSLY POWERFUL EVERYONE WAKE UP AND USE THIS) is nice because you can take your time making sure you're matching the polarity when you're shooting. 
  
Tank: Hazard Protection!! I have a max hazard protection build and I am completely immune to shock. This is the easiest status effect to gain immunity for as you only need 84% protection. My tank build is 4PC patriot, Badger Zero F's (Gila Pointman when in a group) and Yaahl Knees (10% Hazard as the brand set bonus). All 6 pieces have 10% hazard, which that plus Yaahl is 70%, plus 10% from the watch is 80%. One Shock Resistance mod puts you over 84%. I also run one Burn resist mod so i'm immune to burn (great vs outcasts). More info on Hazard Protection sources and thresholds can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fkzvlz/tu8_changes_to_hazard_protection_and_status/  
  
 **Day 1**  
https://imgur.com/a/sJuLrlt  
  
Eliminate Positive Polarity Hostiles: Pretty straightforward, kill the dudes with yellow marks on their heads.  
  
Eliminate Negative Polarity Hostiles with headshot kills: Shoot the dudes with blue marks on their heads, in the head.  
  
Eliminate negative polarity hostiles with the polarity damage buff active: I don't remember if you had to get to x5 for this, but yeah get to x5 and kill dudes with blue marks on their heads. I did this (and most of my challenges) between either DCD Headquarters mission or by completing and resetting heroic checkpoints in the manhunt areas (mostly Ivy Tunnel for me personally with the long straight sightlines and very few places for random patrols to stumble across you, but any of them will work).   
  
Change the polarity of hostile fireteams: You change the polarity by meleeing enemies. Throw on a full blue set (can be completely random), bulwark shield and melee a dude over and over until it's done. Pretty straightforward.  
  
Eliminate positive polarity hostiles while they are on fire: Throw together a decent skill build (i can provide exact details if needed) stacking skill damage and status effect, Acosta's go bag, incendiary grenades, fire chem launcher, fire sticky. Doing this with Outcasts and shooting the yellow rushers in the chests and grenadier's pouches will get this done very quickly.  
  
Complete any main mission on hard or above: Once again, I just did DCD so i could do this and progress all the other steps at once.  
  
**Day 2**  
https://imgur.com/a/y15gbOi  
  
Eliminate Negative Polarity Hostiles: Opposite of Day 1, kill the dudes with blue marks on their heads.    
  
Eliminate Positive Polarity Hostiles with headshot kills: You get the point  
  
Eliminate positive polarity hostiles with the polarity damage buff active: polarity x5 and one shot everyone! I know y'all are running Baker's Dozen already anyway.  
  
Achieve the highest polarity damage buff multiplier: Reach polarity x5, shoot the wrong enemy to shock yourself, rinse and repeat.  
  
Eliminate hostiles of the opposite polarity: Whip out that crusader/striker shield (or a blinder firefly, i'm telling you) and Sweet Dreams and punch the opposite color. You can use a level 30 SD or even the level 1 Lullaby, it doesn't matter.    
  
Take a photo of positive and negative polarity hostiles together: Easy, just find literally any patrol and take a picture.  
  
**Day 3**  
https://imgur.com/a/6QFhPij
  
Eliminate Negative polarity hostiles with weak point kills: As i said before, DCD Headquarters (when you download the DCD data in the library at the end, several waves of rushers come. Shoot their chests. And if you kill the flamethrower chick with her tank explosion that also counts. Wipe and repeat until bored or complete) and Outcasts control points (Ivy Tunnel and reset your manhunt over and over. A lot of rushers come in the second phase when you're defending the CP, on heroic at least. Once again, can also blow up the flamethrower ladies with their own tank, just get them weak first).  
  
Shock three hostiles of the same polarity at the same time: Either find a shock ammo box and shoot three matching enemies in quick succession, or use a skill tier 6 build and throw a shock trap at a patrol (that has 3 of the same polarity obviously). Only have to do it once. Easy.  
  
Take a control point without being shocked or leaving the capture radius: Take your time with the polarities, or run a skill build and don't shoot anything so you don't even take the chance. Also if you have a max hazard protection build it's possible that since you can't get shocked, that will work? Honestly didn't think of it until now. Call your allies immediately so they can take some pressure off you.   
  
Complete any main mission on challenging or above: Once again, i did DCD but yeah whatever you want.   
  
Eliminate Positive Polarity Hostiles with a Specialization Weapon: I used a Tip of the Spear build with Sharpshooter. Pretty straightforward. Probably the easiest to do it since you can one shot pretty much anything below named enemies. Gunner might be good as well. TOTS is nice because it generates ammo for you. Pair with Tardigrade and it's a good time as well.   
  
Eliminate polarized hostiles with a melee attack: Same as before, Sweet dreams/lullaby plus shield or blinder CC.

fpdrcz,Ceerial,Sound issues with Division 2 (PS4),"Sorry if this has been discussed a million times.

I just upgraded to The Division 2 from the original. And despite it being out for some time, I wonder why the sound is poor in the game on PS4.

Generally there's missing a lot of sounds when I play, wether it's ambient sounds, reloading sounds or music that cuts out.

I've tried experimenting with the sounds settings, disabling dolby, buying a new HDMI 2.1 cable, but nothing helps.

Is it a general problem with the game? - or might be something with settings - if so - is there anything that can fix it?",7,1585237603,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpdrcz/sound_issues_with_division_2_ps4/,thedivision,2
fpdp8k,itsnotmeitsthedog,90h in and I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Help would be appreciated,"Hello all. So  I'm very new to the game. I'm very addicted but I've hit a plateau at 90h in.

It has become very real to me that I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been watching a lot of youtube vids trying to understand recalibration and builds ect. Alot of them seem to be boasting of 100k dps and high armour so I thought that's what I should be aiming for. 

I've got a lot of Aqua items and put them together as a set to get their buffs and I've recalibrated what I needed to as a DPS build. Maxed them out with Weapon damage, Crit damage and Crit chance. ( I prefer SMG and assault rifle running with sharpshooter spec).I've gotten to a point where I'm comfortable in world tier 5 taking on yellow bars, can down them pretty easily with no more than 2 mags. Gear score around 512

I went into the Dark Zone for the first time for a change and saw I had 120k DPS and around 200k armour so I engaged some enemy NPCs and was promptly given my arse handed to me on a plater. Over and over again. Mag after mag and I was barely chipping away at there armour ( normal yellow bars with no heavy armour). I'd hate to think how I'd fair against other players if  I can't even take on an NPC.

Can anybody think of anything that I may have done wrong? I honestly thought I had good gear. I'm repeating missions again and again on challenging and just getting the same stat weapons and armour again and again so I was hoping the DZ would have something better.",7,1585237399,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpdp8k/90h_in_and_i_dont_know_what_im_doing_wrong_help/,thedivision,3

fpdfdw,dvb215,Basilisk armor victory....finally!!,"Ok here is my experience with stripping the armor off of the Basilisk:

I play solo on my xbox so my targeting isn't outstanding.  I tried it once and just killed him and then went to watch some videos.  They were helpful but I couldn't replicate their outcomes.

1.  Tried with my lowest level pistol.  Worked ok and got some armor pieces off but then had random shots that did enough damage to eventually kill him.
2.  Tried with the grenade launcher a few times but my targeting wasn't the best and shot between his legs twice and then blew myself up by being too close.  oops.  yeah I know, I suck.
3. Tried with the oxidizer chem launcher which just plain didn't work.  It didn't do enough damage to the armor.
4. Tried to just use my AR but did too much damage on him and not just to the armor.
5. Finally I just used the seeker mine.  It took a bit longer but I just ran around the big loop in the area where you first engage Basilisk and waited for the cool down.  Then you send in another mine and it strips his armor off really well.  It does put a small bleed on him but by the time all of the armor was gone he was at about half health.  Each mine stripped off about 900k-1.1M armor with each mine.

I did this yesterday at Level 40 on Normal with the Demo spec. with all high end gear.  Good luck!",5,1585236492,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpdfdw/basilisk_armor_victoryfinally/,thedivision,3

I used to seriously struggle on heroic with full squad, but now, there seems to be around 2/3 of the enemies, and they are extremely easy to kill, even for me who's a full tank/supp build.  
Heavy armored guys goes down in seconds, combined with the fact that there seems to be less of them coming now.

I find that full squad Heroic to be easier than Challenging used to be, and this just took all of the fun the game had for me. What's even the point of the game if in the highest difficulty setting (apart from if you buy the ""expansion"", that now just seems to be the actual ""complete"" version of the game) you can just turn braindead and pratically spawn kill the enemies.

Invaded full squad Heroic used to be absourdly hard, and for me that's ok, it's the price you pay for better loot chance. And the only mental stimullus to actually make team based builds, actually think strategically and have to prioritize targets and shit. But it's all dead now.

Now before you run in, just north west of the mission is the US national archive building ( under the Navy Plaza control point ) head there and go inside, just past the first room on the left is a shock ammo box, loot it, and head back to the mission.

4 enemies will spawn right at the entrance, simply take a right and head up the stairs to get a height advantage, if 3 out of 4 are the same polarity, simply shoot all 3 in quick succession to get the shocks applied, and you're done.

If they spawn 2-2 simply run back out and reset the mission.

fpco64,VidicusMinion,Polarity event is making people quit the game.,"My friends have gotten pretty frustrated with how absurd the challenges are in the polarity event.  They have logged out after trying the event, given up on the event/game, or just moved on to other games.  Some of the challenges were ok.... but shock three guys of same polarity at once?  Kill negative polarity with weak points?  

These type of challenges make people find one spot to do them and get a few, die, and repeat.  That is tedious, not fun.  And some challenges make you play solo, like headshots.... which is harder in a group.

And it is not just the event, it is the decisions by the developers to do odd things like this that undermine the game's integrity.  I know some people enjoy the event.... and that is fine.  It is just frustrating to play a game with your buddies only to see them leave in frustration.",31,1585233851,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fpco64/polarity_event_is_making_people_quit_the_game/,thedivision,1

Hell, you could even go 1-5 of you wanted to make it go even faster.

Reward your players who play on harder difficulties. It's so annoying to have the most effective choice is to drop from heroic to normal and play an hour doing these challenges while getting terrible normal world loot drops. I could have been doing those challenges with a multiplier while also targetted loot farming on heroic.

Other than that, interesting event. Fun is about a 3 out of 10, but definitely made me change up my play style which I'm always down for. I dont hate it, but man am I glad when I can turn it back off. 

Also, event is terrible for team play since the challenges dont count as a team, its who ever gets the final kill. Puts even more emphasis on running an all red build or just running solo.

Yes, we completed it, but at every room, we felt like we had to use cheese strategies to win, that means almost every room would consist of us engaging with one enemy from afar, then running 2 or 3 rooms backwards just to kite enemies and kill them at a stupidly far distance, it didnt feel like we were even playing the game properly, but how else could we do it? The enemies are simply gods compared to the player.

2/ enemies without weak points but who are inflicted by a statut effect from enemies with a destroyed weak point **does count** for the challenge (ie killing by fire reds outcasts by grenadier's destroyed bag). Care for the right polarity ( Blue !)

The computer room (where we grinded 'set to fire outcast units') in FEB is a great place to do this challenge.

* Go to the computers room
* use Demolisher firefly, Yellow gear advised

Just some of my thoughts on things. I don't think anything I put down is overpowered, but I'm not a game dev. To me this seems fine.

The reason I added the change to the gear sets, was because I currently think taking a brand set over a gear set is better in nearly all circumstances. The only 2 gear sets I've used so far are striker's, and hard wired. I know they are bugged and need fixing, but I'm not sure how those fixes will pan out. With striker's i thought having a guaranteed boost of damage for a short window. Being able to time it with other talents, I thought, could be pretty interesting.",2,1585213337,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp8aro/ideas_for_future_updates/,thedivision,1

fp827o,mythipegs,PvP - post-patch thoughts,"I played a bit of conflict and DZ after the patch yesterday and my initial thoughts are that PvP feels a hell of a lot better. I had some actual gunfights with different phases, the TTK still felt quick enough where it wasn’t a chore - yeah, pretty good. 

Everyone still seems to be running the M1A though, not sure why? I definitely wasn’t getting one shot like before, but there were occasions when I’d get burst down super quick by one, but it certainly feels more fair - perhaps even balanced? Would like to hear other people’s thoughts on this. To be honest, I would have much preferred if they just nerfed the M1A singularly so guns like MK17 could compete but sadly not.

Another note would be that there were still a lot of people running M1As with shields which I think is the most boring and pathetic strategy and it really breaks my immersion (who carries a WWII rifle with a riot shield?). They weren’t that bad, just a nuisance really.

I tried a number of different builds both all-red and some hybrid armour builds and they all felt good in their own way. Would like to know other people’s thoughts!",4,1585211950,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp827o/pvp_postpatch_thoughts/,thedivision,1

So really apart from a single niche build, it kinda makes more sense to have our old holster talents on pistol's. 

I think we all miss stop, drop, roll or rooted or overlap and it would help mitigate some of the hazard issues we currently face.

fp77yx,justthewaylifeis,DARPA Labs frustrations," I’m a long time Xbox player of the division and I have been through the thick and thin of the series. I won’t say that I am the best player of the game (not a heroic completionist) I am semi-casual at the peak. Prior to TU7 every mission minus the raid I could solo on challenging though, with a little finesse and hard work, and that includes DARPA labs. With TU8, I couldn't even progress past the robot room fight.

The main frustration of the fight is the boss himself. I killed everything else in the room 3 different times through a combination of EMP jammer and the assault turret (tier 6 yellow with named China light backpack). But because of the numerous dogs and enemies, my 4 armor kits would be used up and I would have to swap the EMP for the chem healer to repair myself. But because the boss now uses the defender drone with a large health pool, he heals himself every time as I whittle down his drone. I did this no less than 6 times in a single fight, and eventually I accidentally vaulted and he melted my health through my healing pool.

I am never one to complain and have never gotten frustrated with this game until today. It doesn’t help that matchmaking at the pentagon is chancy at best, and for some reason the call for backup function doesn’t exist for some reason, so solo was 70% of my runs in DARPA. But 30 minutes and 6 high end pieces lost because the boss is a S.O.B and has stole all his platoons SAPI plates while I felt the hurt of going from 6 armor kits to 4. I don’t know if the enemy scaling for solo is still kinda lopsided or the mission just got to me, but for a highly tuned skill damage build it is aggravating to kill everything in the room and surviving all the near one shots , only to lose because I can’t DPS the boss enough before he heals and i have to sacrifice a skill slot to keep myself in the fight. 

TLDR: never ending armor kits, rogue SHD tech, the enemy amount and damage output taking all my kits finally got me to rage quit out of a un-winnable fight. The first time in 4 years. Tried other gear loadouts and nothing could get him down without suiciding myself.",10,1585207199,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp77yx/darpa_labs_frustrations/,thedivision,1

4. Run minigun loadout glitch from 1st loadout to 8th loadout. This will overlap the carefulness talent to the 1st weapon (shotgun).

5. Kill a named mob.

6. Shot the dead named mob with the shotgun

Let’s us begin with some of the challenges and the individuals most likely to snag victory.

1. 100M Sprint: Many have endured countless hours of training and hardship to claim the title of the fastest man alive. The crowd favorite is most likely, the Black Tusk assault rifleman. He is said to run faster than a bullet fired from an M1A fired by a SHD agent and can flank his opponent before they can even get through their halfway reload point. I am sure he is more than capable to take the first spot.

2. Trap Shooting: Steady hands are the mark of a hardened professional. What better an individual to claim this spot than the True Sons Shotgun Rusher. Popular tales place his accuracy to be so precise as to hit his mark (SHD Agent) from more than a 100 feet away, with all shells hitting their target. Laughable, I’m sure, is the aim of an agent who can hardly hold a candle to such legendary accuracy. No wooden ducks are safe I’m afraid.

3. Shot Put: Anyone can throw a few pounds of metal some feet away, as demonstrated so accurately by our strong division agents. But can you throw a fragmentation grenade all across the building block when you’re taking over a control point? I don’t think so. Behold, the    Hyena Thrower. Their ability to lob grenades over distances so vast is truly admirable. I’m sure many agents can attest to be blown up by a seemingly impossible throw coming at them from a great distance and seeing their own weak throw being dependent on their chest armor?? Don’t know what that means. Probably requires a special TALENT. Another contender worthy of competition is the Outcast Flame Thrower. Never have agents been more afraid to see a tiny bottle of alcohol rip through the air and also through 800k worth of armour. 

4. Javelin Throw: Similar to the above, but utilizing a leaner projectile. Contestants in shot put can be considered as favorites for this event as well. 

5. Pistol Shooting: This competition requires nerves of steel and razor sharp focus to be extremely accurate. The crowd favorite is the Hyena SmG rusher. A magazine? 10 rounds? No my friends. One bullet fired from an smg is all that is needed to make quick work of this hyena’s foes in the battlefield. It is no surprise that when such an individual can fire with both arms outstretched, 200 meters away, through fog, with laser accuracy, what is but a few 50 meters for a challenge? Nevertheless, our challenger will surely demonstrate their remarkable ability through a gas mask which pretty much makes them blind. 

6: Double Trap: Our interpretation of this sport is to utilize a heavy machine gun with a set number of rounds, laid at the farthest distance, at whichever firing position, and have the most rounds hit a target in the shape of a SHD agent. All heavy gunners are in favorable positions for this spot as their iron sight lmgs can pinpoint a target more than a mile away, obviously through fog and rain (day and night), and pump lead. 

These were just a few of the many disciplines that are to come. Please make sure to add your own and improve upon our current catalog. Some additional events are as follow:

Boxing: Hyena Rusher. Shred through 700k armour with nothing but a metal baton with a couple of batteries installed? No problem.

Judo: Hammer Guy and Minigun Chungus. Both capable of rising out massive damage in short spans. 

Golf: Why use clubs when drones can just do it better? Meet the Black Tusk Controller. No clubs, no problem. Let loose a few of these drones and agents....uhm...golf balls won’t know what hit them. 

Talk are ongoing about considering the best dressed teams, but in our opinion, wearing a yellow raincoat over a hunters vest, murica shorts and red sneakers with a black mask with suspiciously white drip marks, takes the first prize.

fp6nq6,TenableTarsier,Some feedback/thoughts from a casual,"Preface/background:

This isn't a ""change this or I quit!"" kind of post - I want that to be clear from the outset.

I didn't play Division 1; not once, not ever. I barely heard about it and honestly forgot about it until I heard about this game during the beta testing.

I'm not a super-strong FPS-style game player. I'm not total crap (my aim is okay, not great - please don't ask me to snipe during battle), and I sometimes make bad decisions.

This isn't a post meant to cry about game balance - it's more meant to kind of air out how I feel as a relatively new, and most definitely casual player. 

I'm sure a lot of responses will include statements about learning enemy spawns, enemy weak points (most of which I think I have a handle on), lowering the difficulty, joining a group, and, most assuredly, ""I did it with may hands behind my back, blind-folded, while being thrown off a cliff - git gud!""

That's fine - but I'm not you and maybe I'll never be as good. That's just how it is.

Some thoughts and observations from a know-nothing scrub agent:

I started playing from level 1 and got to 30 in the base game. The game felt okay on story mode and I learned a lot during that time, as one might expect. I knew from the beta that it's a move-and-shoot style game that uses cover to provide opportunities to do damage and keep yourself alive.

Skipping ahead: after getting to 30 and putting around a bit, I went ahead and bought Warlords and played through it to level 40. After hitting 40, I stayed on normal difficulty for a day or so, farmed up a bit, and got a few decent pieces of gear (Lady Death SMG, for example). It felt, at this point, that I was definitely ready for higher level and more challenging content, so I went ahead and started bumping the difficulty. To be clear, I did go normal to hard to challenging (which is where I left it for a bit). 

It was at this point that I started to learn that this game is very punishing for even the slightest mistakes in target priority, positioning, and, most poignantly, lack of high level gear.

Part of the what I learned during this time was that the game decided to begin abusing the fact that players must use the game's built-in mechanics.

*You should use cover*: Great! Have some grenade spam (from multiple enemies) that fire over it or do AoE damage around it. Or RC bombs...or grenade drones...or assault drones...or explosive drones. The list goes on.

*You should move often to avoid grenades*: Smart! Now you know that every faction is comprised of former spec ops sharp shooters who can gun you down with highly inaccurate weapons from ranges that make Chris Kyle sit up and say ""whoa!""

*You should fight where there is plenty of cover to move between to avoid being pinned*: Useful tactic! Enjoy these heavily-armored suicide bombers and melee combatants that will blindly rush you and not stop until killed.

*Use those tech skills, agent*: So sophisticated and complex! Too bad that most of these skills have little or no effect on most enemies, except to buy a fraction of an inch of space that only feels like it delays your inevitable death. Repair drones are nice, though...except that without the proper sacrifice in gear load out, the healing they provide is minuscule compared to the damage a single enemy round will deal, regardless of where it hits you.

*Target enemy weak points:* You got it! Works great on lower difficulties, but on the higher difficulties even the weak points feel like they have armor. Worse yet, some weak points are protected on enemies (guys with the blink/blinding ability come to mind) and require flanking due to large pieces of armor and/or shields. Can't flank them? Dang. Good thing I have 900 rounds of ammo for this SMG and another 144 rounds for my shotgun.

This is likely bordering on whinging/whining at this point, but I promise it isn't (or isn't trying to be, at least).

It's difficult (ha!) to put concisely into words how I feel about the game because this is a decidedly complex and multi-layered creation. This is about my gut reaction to what the game does, or perhaps resorts to, for added ""difficulty"".

I stopped playing Div 2 for a bit because, apart from the rampant enemy spawn bugs that prevented me from completing various missions that totally destroyed my resolve to continue, I saw that increasing the difficulty didn't actually increase the difficulty - it just added more cheese to my cheese sandwich. It meant I needed to spend more time, doing substantially more damage, to more targets while trying not to die from a few seconds of exposure to enemy fire.

Today I decided to stop in after hearing about a patch. Specifically, it mentioned that enemy damage and armor was being decreased to increase accessibility. *Score!* Right up my alley!

Not.

I lowered the difficulty to hard from challenging. I could survive on challenging, but it's an investment in time that I don't typically have toward the late evenings. I figured I'd flip the switch, raid a few CPs and call it night.

Imagine my shock when, even on hard now, I was being absolutely melted and swarmed by enemies at a level 2 CP. For context, I've successfully done level 4s with some effort, but no deaths. Tonight I wiped twice for all the reasons outlined above and called it quits for the evening. It is clear that my definition of ""small damage increase"" is much different than Ubi's.

I wish I had an answer to the problems I'm facing other than more gear, more armor, more hp, and more DPS. It's not a problem unique to this game and probably not unique to me, but it is how it is.

Perhaps the best way to summarize my feeling about the game is this:

To win, I must prepare all of my equipment and skills, then in battle do many, many things quickly and correctly. The enemies? Not so much.

fp6mtg,cphillips148,"New to endgame, solo player, also need a clan","Hey, I was a huge fan of division one and me and my friends all got division 2 to grind over the COVID break.  They stopped playing around level 20 but I got into world tier one today and have messed around for a little bit.  Still kinda confused on how the game works now but I just had a few questions.  Is basically everyone max gear score? Is war lords of New York neccesary?  I know it let’s you become level 40 but is that really a big deal?  Since DZ is world tier 1-5 is it even worth it to go if I’m tier 1?  I’m also a solo player so does that make the DZ impossible?

fp68rt,Menellaus,Simply Some FEEDBACK.......,"First and foremost hope everyone at Massive is well and my thoughts and prayers go out to all Family ,Developers,and Players....

Stay safe remember to enjoy yourself and practice Social Distancing as much as possible.....

Ok.....Back to what we Agents in The Division do best rant and complain..

There is Some Good but we are here for the Bad....

➖Revive Hive is Bugged

(Now you can't res someone after they go down unless a revive Hive is placed) and the old BUG of it just not working is still there....

➖Sound BUG .

The Most Notorious Villan in the Division (Undefeated) is still here (Now you get a Chain Gun sound throughout the length of a Mission with the volume on 8) 

➖Difficulty is Not the Issue...

The main problem is The LOOT that Drops on Heroic and Legendary is just not worth the Time..

IMO Best Farming difficulty is on Challenging since Missions are doable in 10 - 15 minutes...
Unless you can run Heroics in the same time....

Having random rolls on Exotics is the Right Call but their Source Location and Drop Chance MUST be Higher...

We don't need to be showered with exotics,What we need is a Higher Drop Rate With the possibility of a GOD ROLL having a 2 to 5 % Chance depending on difficulty  but the weapon itself Must drop more often. 

I have gotten 6 Exotics and none of them can replace Any of my Hi-End Weapons. 

The Thrill should be getting that GOD ROLL Exotic Not Getting an Exotic...

Ex...Lady Death

Wait 30 to Spawn a Random Boss.
RNG #1 Pray that you spawn a Boss
RNG #2 Pray that said BOSS drops the weapon
RNG #3 Pray that the weapon  has any good stats..

I have All Cards from NYC and have NEVER had it Drop...

Would be nice to have a Boss Kill Count 

Don't get the Dedicate drop grinding,on the 20th ,50th whatever kill the Weapon is a Guaranteed Drop..(Not a Guaranteed GOD Roll)

At least you know what you are working Towards...

➖Matchmaking...

This might be on my End but it has been very inconsistent,.
Some missions you wait 15 minutes, some you just don't get Matched at all...

➖Enemy Status Effect....

POISON and FIRE are a Certain Death regardless of ARMOR,Hazard Protection or Health
(You and anyone in proximity even enemies die INSTANTLY)

Enemies must have longer cool downs on skills on Heroic or Legendary 
Black Tusk just Spam Their Skills Non Stop...
Bombardier Drones,Missiles, Seeker Mines,Etc....

➖Blueprints Do Not drop after a Certain Point from CP4

I am missing 6 attachments with the 5.56 Mag being one and just can't get it..

Is weird to play a game for a year and not have a simple way to get the attachments for our weapons.

fp5ttp,imstealingacorns,Bring back the turret glitch Massive,"You know what the turret glitch did for me? It allowed me to play the game like the PvE grind it should be. 

I glitched  2mil damage on a Rifle last night and then solo and in groups of 2, played a bunch of Challenge missions for like 5 hours. I got 1 piece of gear I might use eventually in a skill build and my gear ain't all that good.  But the pace was nice and it was fun. It was DZ pace for the light world. 

Know what happens today? I can't get the glitch to work, so I hop in the DZ and see rogue after rogue and manhunt after the manhunt and get nothing even extracted.  Instead, I got bullied and ganked and shit talked at. I'm 40 years old, I don't need this shit. I don't need to get bullied around b/c that's the only power leveling loot environment you set up. A place where I'm forced to play against people SD levels 300 and up and I'm not even 100. A place that encourages other people to wait until you're not looking and cheapshot you. I don't even want to kill other people, I want to team up with them.

You know, fuck it: if I can't get loot or a pace that's fun, without having to be in an environment that promotes bullying, fine, you can't have my money.

Assholes.

fp5jj7,Handlaxp,CC Build in Legendary Strongholds?,"First I off, I’m on console/PS4, so there’s that. 
I’ve been running a blinder/banshee/jammer build that’s made challenging and heroic missions pretty easy (assuming I don’t crash my firefly). I thought I’d try legendaries - and we get absolutely crushed. The enemy AI rushing and constant drone explosions totally overwhelm the group. 

It’s also like the status effects last half as long, and even when they’re blinded they’re still barreling forward, or in the case of the Minigun heavies, firing blindly and killing us anyway in the DU Stronghold. 

I’m optimized for status effect and skill haste. My banshee cooldown is 10.5s with 13.4 status effect, and blinder like 24/23 respectively.

Acosta’s go bag, 3 piece wyvern, Hana u chest, and one other I can’t remember, but it’s either SH or SE or skill duration bonus

I’m wondering if this kind of CC has a place in Legendary, or if there’s a better set of skills that I could be more useful to the group with? Or is it that the DPS folks just aren’t holding up their end of the bargain?

In Battery Park, travel to Rector St., between Washington St. and West St. At the ground floor, beneath some scaffolding, go into the Kerman Coffee. Run to the rear door and go upstairs to the 2nd floor and go through the doorway. Run to the end of the hall and repel down the elevator shaft. Behind the front desk, you'll see a computer terminal that shows ""Use Keyboard"". When you do this, the ceiling lights will turn orange, showing that the pre-condition for the following events needed to be triggered to spawn the last Hunter has started (the way you did at the Washington Monument in DC). 

Unfortunately, this is all I have found, but hopefully this leads to the discovery of the final Hunter. Good luck guys!

fp4dr4,FeyReddit,"Stage 4 Technician, The Raven","How are you finding this? I keep failing it even though I’m destroying the ammo boxes before he dies.

The mission text says, “Head to Manning National Zoo on Normal or higher and kill ""The Raven"" but destroy his ammo pack first.” 

Fair enough but I’ve done that three times now, once using a gun to target the boxes and twice last night with the Firefly, Demolisher (after reading that suggestion here on a year old thread). Neither works.

Some say it needs to be done on Hard or above, but the text says, Normal or higher, so that can’t be right.

My last run, I let the ammo cook off after using the Firefly, and then tried the Firefly again to see if it picked up an unexplored pack on Raven, and it didn’t. So, I let Raven run around for about another 20 odd seconds, and then killed him...

fp49e7,generally-speaking,"There's no reason to complain about Polarity Switch, it give you round about a 75% damage boost when at max stacks. If you can't complete missions with it, you need to adapt your build and learn the mechanics a bit better!","Polarity Switch is an event which rewards accuracy over anything else, it's very confusing and hard to play with at first. But in return, when you're at full stacks you're dealing more than 75% additional damage.

That means if you hit 3m initially, you'll be hitting over 5,5 million with the same shot and max polarity stacks. This makes some missions more difficult, especially those where you get overrun with enemies in close quarters, while others, where there is a lot of space in between you and the enemies, get easier. 

An example of a mission well suited to this event is Jefferson Trade Center, where most of the enemies spawn right in front of you and far away allowing you the time to pick them off easily. 

Screenshot example, 11 minutes 43 second JTF completion on Heroic, with all directives active (Ammo Hoarder, Cool Skills, Fog of War, No Regen, Special Ammo). 

I'm really stumped at how people get served an event which allows you to deal 75% additional damage, yet they complain that it's a bit hard keeping track of a couple of colors.",26,1585192750,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp49e7/theres_no_reason_to_complain_about_polarity/,thedivision,1

Should I swap out this 42k armor Stat for a 9.9 weapon dmg increase? Or keep the armor?

fp3cnz,ZeroRequi3m,I honestly don't think Massive are going to be capable of fixing DIV2. There seems to be no vision or concept of FUN.,"I genuinely think Massive are trying to make a good game. I honestly do. I KNOW there's a lot of really talented and creative and awesome people over there working on this game. 

I also genuinely don't think it matters and this game will never truly be fixed. 

I've lost count of the number of times Massive have overhauled or ""fixed"" the two games in the Division series. Honestly. Every few months you see some pretty big change or rework as Massive go from one extreme to the other without ever seeming to play or understand their own game. Let's look at some examples of what's wrong with Div 2 currently:

- The entire skill mod system is worthless. They are a needless pain to sort through, are for some reason locked so you can't run the same mods on one skill and make truly focused skill builds, far too many, and do next to nothing (+4% duration, are you kidding me??) and honestly can't justify their existence right now. Like jesus at worst just make a mod style recalibration library??? 

- Game balance is quite literally all over the map. Seriously. You can play a tank and have a great time doing CDC headquarters, having some close calls but genuinely feel pretty useful, then you can play Federal Emergency Bunker and want to blow your brains out when you go down for the 11th time from sticking your foot in poison or fire. While FULL SHIELD AND ARMOR. 

- CP's have been broken for weeks now. And why? They were working perfectly fine before? Why roll out a change to them until you'd tested it? This isn't a bug that you could only find with lots of players, the entire system behind them is quite literally broken and there's no excuse that made it through testing. 

- Weapon balance is also all over the universe. The entire red meta right now is literally just run two M1A's. That's it. Shotguns are garbage, and marksmen rifles are pretty garbage and slow and every other rifle is worthless. Even most Assault rifles are passed over because a crit SMG or LMG build is vastly preferred especially thanks to the large ammo pools. 

- These ""events"" so far are very clearly quickly slapped together. Or else not a single person at Massive plays anything other than DPS. How are support/CC/Healer/Tank players supposed to do the event? TU8 was supposed to encourage build diversity yet you make it so everyone needs to play a DPS to do the league and Polarity events??? Do you have two completely separate teams making this game? 

- MOST exotics are pretty pointless. I don't care much exotics myself honestly but the whole point of exotics are supposed to be these cool powerful pieces of gear that fit a specific playstyle or roll that further encourages build diversity. Right now though? The old exotics are just trash and the new ones are incredibly bland. The mask is literally just a crit piece and the tarigrade chest is just ""here have armor whenever yours breaks oof so interesting"". SURELY there's some people at massive with more creativity than that. 

- There are FARRRRR too many things to matchmake for in this game and FARRRR too few players for it all. Unless you're doing the flavour of the week good luck trying to find any players in this CO-OP MULTIPLAYER game outside of a 20 minute wait, if you're lucky. Why can't you just add a fill queue that gives decent rewards and puts players into any random mission party? Furthermore why isn't there an option to have your world space be public like areas in Destiny are for example? Why is this co-op multiplayer game so anti social?? 

- Why weren't dedicated roles a focus from the very beginning? Shit we don't even have something as basic as role icons so when I join a party I can tell right away what everyone is whether thats DPS, healing or tank or a hybrid? I've seen a full red rifle player with two healing skills so unless I go check his gear (which is a pain and I have to stop to do) how am I supposed to know if hes a dedicated healer or not??? Just base the role icon off of the players highest attributes?? If you have high repair skill obviously you're a healer??

- Why was all the progress from Div 1 thrown out??? Seriously I know it's a dead horse but Div 1 WAS in a pretty good place with 1.8. Why did you take that success and throw it out the window and just relaunch Div 1 1.0 again?? And where is Survival and even the Underground??

- There are FAR too many bugs for what should have just been an expansion to a game. 

I think that covers some of the big stuff. Honestly in general Massive just doesn't seem to understand why people love the division or whats actually fun about their game. All you have to do is PLAY IT and think to yourself ""is getting a 7th +4% duration skill mod that you can't even stack and makes 0.0001% of difference FUN""???? Is that ENJOYABLE? Does it give you a feel of satisfaction or excitement? 

Spoiler: No of course it doesn't. 

Make the game FUN while still CHALLENGING. Cheap deaths or almost unavoidable high damage such as poison or fire is not challenging. Make the game actually co-op/multiplayer. If you want to have such an absurd amount of things to have matchmaking for you need a way to push players into them. Or at least make it cross platform jesus. Make the game feel REWARDING and not ""oh shit this is my 8th time dropping an exotic that barely does anything anyways and the stat rolls are garbage...yay?"" the game is desperately in need of something exciting. 

Thanks for joining me on my Ted Talk, again I have a huge respect for Massive devs and I hope everyones staying safe out there but, it's just really frustrating to see SO MUCH POTENTIAL in the Division 2 that for some reason, Massive either has no idea what to do with it or doesn't even see it.",357,1585188959,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp3cnz/i_honestly_dont_think_massive_are_going_to_be/,thedivision,1

fp2zxe,GingerGerald,"If you could add new talents to The Division 2, what would they be be?","After TU8 there were a bunch of new talents added and modified allowing for entirely new builds. Personally, I'd like to see more of them and I'm curious what kind of talents other players would like to see.

For ease of reading and clarity, please list the name of the talent, what it goes on, the effect, and why you think it'd be an interesting addition.

To get us started, here are a couple of talents I think could be interesting as concepts:

* Fiberoptic Sensors (Gear, Backpack)
   * Enemies affected by your skills are pulsed for 15s.
   * Cooldown: 30 seconds.
   * This skill is for people who want to take advantage of the Spotter talent but don't use Pulse, or have the Technician Laser. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Charged Rounds (Gear, Chest)
   * Skill kills have a X (25%) chance your Turret and Drone to apply status effects (shock, fire, bleed) for X (10?) seconds.
   * One of the things I've always envied about enemy engineers is the fact that their turrets can apply status effects. Turret and Drone builds also feel a bit lacking, except for the Sniper turret and I feel this could help alleviate that issue by giving them brief moments of extra damage and CC.

&amp;#x200B;

* Carbon Plating (Gear, ?)
   * Deployed skills are indestructible for X (10?) seconds after being deployed
   * On higher difficulties player skill proxies are often destroyed by enemies within 5 seconds of being deployed, leaving skill players high and dry until their skills come off cooldown.

&amp;#x200B;

* Stun Gun (Weapon, Pistol)
   * Deal 20% weapon damage to shocked enemies + Switching to this weapon causes the next round that hits to shock enemies for 3s.
   * Cooldown: 20 seconds (skill kills reduce the cooldown of this effect by 5 seconds)
   * Unless you're running a dedicated shield/pistol build, pistols and their talents are lackluster. I feel like this could give people who don't use 

With those out of the way, what do you folks think could be some interesting talents?",21,1585187540,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp2zxe/if_you_could_add_new_talents_to_the_division_2/,thedivision,1

fp2xgc,Kandicainerides,Crusader shield build help please,"Hello. I'm trying to make a tank build with the crusader shield but running into some issues.

I am aware that it has significantly less health than other shields but I am unsure that this is what is causing the problem I'm having. 

When running this shield, compared to other shields, I am finding it is taking significantly more damage compared to the deflector shield in the specific instance of explosions. 

An explosion that would only knock off 1/4 of the deflector shield is completely destroying my crusader shield. Is the crusader shield more susceptible to explosions?

My second question is this. I am running into instances of this shield becoming disabled and put away. Is there some kind of disrupt that is causing this but not with other shields?

Overall should I be modding disrupt and or explosive resist?

My final question is about the artifice hive. If I mod skill power, will the stowed hive repair more of the shield? I do not understand the skill tier effects that the hive is showing in relation to refreshing the shield.

fp2s0x,Brokeng3ars,Can we maybe tone down fire/poison/bleed damage yeah? Whats the point of trying to tank when this shit kills you in half a second THROUGH your armor and shield? @Massive,"Seriously WHY does enemy status effects (fire/bleed/poison) have to do SO MUCH DAMAGE???

There's nothing ""challenging"" about having a poison cloud shot at you (which you can BARELY SEE) in cover which then drops you to downed before you can even move. That's not good game design or even truly difficult it's just aggravating and frankly unfair. It's cheap. 

I primarily main tank and it feels awful to have a full shield and armor and then suddenly wind up on the floor just because I put one toe in a cloud of poison or someone hit me with fire from the other continent. And yes I have A LOT of hazard protection too and honestly I think it's bugged because it makes NO DIFFERENCE. 

Oh and for the love of god, Massive wants this game to be ""realistic"" and yet rolling around on the floor doesn't help you being on fire at all??? Cmon guys. 

If you want to make the game CHALLENGING then make it CHALLENGING. 

Improve the AI, add more enemy variety thats difficult to deal with, add more mechanics to the game SOMETHING just don't add in cheap basically unavoidable deaths. It feels like shit.

fp1x0c,hey_its_drew,You know what actually bothers me about The Division? It understates the darkness of its subject matter a lot and has some real horror legs that it just won’t use.,"I don’t mind that we are often portrayed as the good guys, but the bad guys have some really dark notes that aren’t really part of the experience and this is an adult game. I understand wanting accessibility and to not bum your players out, but the suggestion alone invites some commitment to that thematic scope. That darkness is just side dressing as it is. Modern Warfare wasn’t just successful because it plays well. It was also successful for delivering an immersive experience where gameplay and drama intersected. The coercive methods a lot of them use should have a lot of hard moments where we see human suffering. We often find dark implications throughout environments, but it’s always just a view of the aftermath. I think if The Division committed more to that aspect of its intrigue they’d find a much greater connection with motivation outside of just the grind. I don’t see this fanbase roleplay and stick to this game near as much as others because the disconnect between gameplay and context is the goal seemingly. 

There’s also a lot of instances where it shows some real potential for horror flavored encounters in its atmosphere, and it would definitely break up the vibe of encounters more to steer into that some more.

fp1p0q,pnelrd,Target training bug (?) glitch (?) where if you fail at certain points it still gives you about 1/3 exp and you can try again,"So, I was doing a target practice, on challenging, since I was farming for control point and this was where the target loot was for petrov and I wanted the named petrov gloves. The first time I tried to do it, I failed on round 2 having hit all the target but one, I couldn't see the last one since I seem to be blind, and I saw that it still gave me 30k exp. I decided to do some testing and it seems to work up to 3 times, after the third time the trainer leaves and you can't try again on that target practice. 

First time: hit round 2, hit all the targets but one, and let the timer go, it will say that you failed but still reward you with some crafting resources, the targeted loot, and 30k exp

Second time: get to round 3,hit all the targets but one, and let the timer go, same thing, resources, loot, and 30k exp

Third time:finish it, it gives me 110k exp, the loot, and the resources.

I tried to do some testing, and if you try to fail the first time on round 4 you still only get 30k exp, and the second time you try to fail at that stage it doesn't give exp or anything else. Tried failing round 1, it gave me nothing. I tried failing on round 3 and then round 2, the first time I got the exp and the second time I didn't. I tried using another weapon and fail first time on round 2, then round 3, and then finish the practice, I get exp all 3 times, 30k, 30k, 110k.

I don't know if this was a known thing, but seeing as target practice is the easiest way to farm exp right now, since it can be easily done on heroic and with all the modifiers active for extra exp, I thought about sharing with you. Also, if you want to do further testing, please do and share it here, just out of curiosity if this wasn't a known thing",11,1585182533,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp1p0q/target_training_bug_glitch_where_if_you_fail_at/,thedivision,1

Year 4 would take our agents to 4 new Locations: (Random choices) Michigan, Wyoming, Kansas and Colorado

\---

Plot: The Black Tusks have occupied Yellowstone National Park and other key cities and towns in Wyoming and are setting up missile launch sites to strike key SHD nodes in Austin, L.A, Seattle and Atlanta. We have to kick them out.

Black Tusks have also occupied small towns throughout Kansas and Colorado in order to secure key locations of the Interstate Highway and control the land supply routes.

As well, A distress call came from a JTF Laboratory in Ann Arbor. The Black Tusks have Doctor Jessica Kandell and several staff members hostage in order to produce more Broad Spectrum Anti-virals and other bio-enhancements in order to improve their combat effectiveness.

\---

For this expansion, in order to avoid raising the level cap AGAIN, a minimum SHD level would be required, as enemies would now be able to reach up to level 45. This expansion could also see the re-introduction of the original Tactical Links, but only for PvE use, as it would break PvP activities.(This one may not be very popular, i can feel it)

As well, a third skill slot would be introduced in order to give the players even more build flexibility. (This one won't be popular either and may be criticized by everyone with stuff like ""Then everyone will be running 6-tier Mortar + Attack Drone + Cluster Seeker builds and game will be hell. Ur an idiot xd"")

Alright, that's the whole idea, bye

\---

P.S: Yeah, I know that making new locations isn't easy and this will obviously see backlash in the form of ""tf u thinking about. devs are also people, u don't know nothing about game dev, ur stupid, go die"" and stuff that is in those same lines, but hey, we all have the right to imagine ideal worlds. see ya",4,1585182458,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fp1ob3/possible_expansion_ideas_for_year_3_i_just_want/,thedivision,1

fp1ltj,Corralis,What a difference a good build makes,"So previously to my latest build I had a good AR build (not perfect but it was good) but man I struggled to complete Roosevelt Island on Heroic in under 50 minutes. Then I got a godrolled Bakers Dozen, swapped out my Kneepads for Fox's Prayer and switched specialisation over to the Sharpshooter and just now managed to complete Roosevelt Island in 22:55.
That mission went from being insanely difficult to seriously easy in one quick move.
I should point out that this time was in a 4-man randomly matched group and not solo.
I also managed to complete the Federal Emergency Bunker in just over 16 minutes when my previous best time was over 22:30.
Im absolutely loving this build so Agents, if something seems too difficult for you, don't give up. Try a different build and see how you do.

fp0tpj,swat532,Fellow agents.. let's recap the rules of engagement,"Given how this community is growing, I think it might be a good time to review some of the rules of engagement when playing.

Just for the sake of maintaining a better gaming experience and keeping our community to a higher standard. 

These are only my thoughts and I welcome everyone to share theirs as well :)   


1. **Don't call for backup unless you actually need it.**   
Agents.. unless you actually want people to join your game and play, don't just call for backup. Don't sit idle in your base of operations for an hour. I understand there are exceptions but generally speaking, I think it's a good rule to follow.  

2. **If you are down, don't respawn if you see other agents coming to help you**  
This is another important one, I've had many instances of risking my health running to save someone, only to have them respawn just as I get to them. Please be patient as your fellow team mates fight their way to save you!   

3. **Don't rearrange your inventory in the middle of the game**  
I understand you wanna look at all your new god rolls ..cough.. min rolls..in the middle of the game, but resist this urge until the mission is completed. Having your team wait for you for 45 minutes whilst you sort your gear is not ideal   

4. **Don't YOLO in! This is a cover based game!**   
This is an important one, I've seen too many people just run in, or get too worked up in the middle of the battle and run in, just to get swamped by enemies and die. If you do this, you put everyone else at risk , because now someone has to rush to save you. Let's take it nice and steady ladies and gentlemen!   

5. **Provide fire cover if someone is helping a downed agent!**  
I think this is another good combat rule, if it's possible, provider cover when someone is trying to revive another team member. They are both vulnerable and enemies take advantage of them! Distracting enemies is also another good strategy. I've died many times whilst trying to revive someone as the rest of the team went on with their business.   

6. **Follow the group leader!**   
I've joined many teams where the lead either completely ignored other members (especially when free roaming) or the rest of the team just ignored the lead. If you are the lead, please select the next activity as promptly as you can when free roaming. This way we can all enjoy ""the flow"". By the same token, If you are in someone's group, don't run around doing other activities if a new activity has been selected by the group leader..   

7. **Share your fixer drones!**  
If you're in full armor and notice a team member low on health, direct your drone to provide them with extra protection (if you can obviously). Remember, your livelihood depends on theirs as well! Same goes for other skills obviously.

Also meta:   
Why does everyone immediately leave after the mission is completed?   
I often stick around in random groups as much as I can. Having to constantly match make is a bit annoying. It's not that big of a deal though.  
Finally, I think we should still give ourselves a huge pat on the back.   
I'm really impressed by the level of maturity in most threads on reddit. Yes sometimes things get heated and conversations degrade, but generally I find the division community much healthier to be around with. 

Over &amp; out.

fp0neg,racingsoldier,MASSIVE: Agents Will Always Complain,"Massive, keep doing what you are doing.  Agents will complain no matter what you do.  

I am a 19 year Army careerist turned agent.  I was involved with the invasion of Iraq in 2003. While I wasn’t with 3rd ID spearhead, we were combat support setting up the immediate holding areas for detainees that the front was kicking back.  We were living in an extremely austere environment.  We were out on 24 hour patrols eating only prepackaged meals ready to eat (MRE) for 6 months.  Finally our contractors caught up with us and they built a real chow hall on our FOB.  On opening day they served surf and turf (steak, fried shrimp, crab legs, and lobster).  Soldiers were lined up for a mile for their first real meal in so many months.  After hours of waiting in line we finally got to the front and were about to go inside.  As we approached the door a group of enlisted exited complaining that the steak was too tough, the shrimp were too small, and the lobster was rubbery.  This is when I learned that people will beg for something to complain about, and they will ALWAYS complain, even if you fly lobster into a combat zone from halfway around the world just to make their day a little less shitty.

fozs6n,Drakne-,Creating a better RPG The division,"Hello everyone! my name a Drakne. ive played both the devision 1 and 2 for ...Alot of hours. and ive come up with some suggestions that i think will make the game a better RPG.

Since massive has moved more twords a trinity style of class system i think thiese fixes will help make some of the skills/builds intresting

\-FIXING SKILLS

\--Skills Should be broken down into 3 different sections.

when there in these sections they will scale wtih REDS and yellows.(more on yellows down the post)

\---DPS / TANK(CONTROL) / SKILL/HEALER

\----Decoy/pulse drone/traps/riot foam (DPS SKILLS) obviously some of the skills could be put into the Tank(CONTROL) section. but dps needs some reliable ways to CC a target or just escape 

\--TANK(control)

\---Most games when you play a tank, you want to control the battlefield deny the enemy from your squishes. 

\---Shields/ALL CC skills will now scale with blues and yellows

\---Shields need to have a taunt or just some inate way to gain aggro. having enemies run around you to kill you teammates is awful feeling i would really like melee to act as a taunt for the shield

&amp;#x200B;

\---I would like to see maybe healer drone or just chem heal here aswell. i know alot of people like to play a ""paladin"" and a heal even if it isnt one of the best ones could be here.

&amp;#x200B;

\--Skill/healer

\---So we get to it. skill builds. obviously skill builds should have access to all skills. healers as well. without splitting to many hairs. yellows will continue to scale with all skills

\---Healers,  Repair skills at 100% or more threshold should receive a Cleanse type feature with there heals. further reinforcing the fact that your a medic. as such you should be different from a Damage Yellow build.

\-Cleanse. remove status effects from ally, 2 second immunity, 5 second CD. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\--Mechanics/ how skills should be treated in game.

\--Skills are at this moment a hinderence. now. hold your pitchforks just a second. let me explain.

Skill builds are for lack of a better term divisions version of a wizard. as such wizards forgo armor and weapon damage in order to do damage via skills. However, at no point in anyother video game can you lock a wizard out of there skills for 15-30 seconds. right now. you can.

\--Heavys should NOT target skills. right now a heavy will RUN across a level just to kick you skill. this is ABSURD considering they DO NOT run across a level to target a RIFLE user. OR A SHIELD USER.

\--When a skill breaks from being shot and or destroyed BEFORE the cool down period(you destroying it doesn't count) THAT should be treated as an interupt. like in other RPG'S and the skill should cycle back to being used. AGAIN your a skill build. at no point does a rifle user get locked out of shooting something for 15-30 seconds.  (obviously mines should not have a 1 second cooldown unless they were destroyed BEFORE doing any damage)

&amp;#x200B;

\-- seeker mine is a great example of a really powerful skill. But unfortunately there not all great skills.

\-Airburst seeker mine. is awkward and frustrating to use. should work just like the bleed mine. i know it has the mortar turret reticle, but right now enemies know its coming before you even lock a target.

&amp;#x200B;

\--ALL turrets. currently ALL turrets can basicly be one shot. thats not great. either increase there HP or make them untargetable in PVE content. 

&amp;#x200B;

\--Adressing the reviver hive. should only have max charges for skill/healer builds. wouldnt scale with reds or blues.

&amp;#x200B;

So. in conclusion i feel that skills should be treated more like a wizards fireball considering there giving up weapon damage and tankiness for there roll. 

Tanks Should be able to control or LOCKDOWN a battlefield. 

DPS(REDS) should have some skills that help them either get agro off of them or shift attention back to the tank. and i feel some skills should scale with reds, like decoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

fozmu9,Favure,"So after testing Hard-Wired just now, as the devs have claimed to have fixed it, the backpack talent still DOES NOT work.","After testing it, everything seems to work: The bonus damage from feedback loop (10%) now works, and the chest price talent (increasing feedback loop damage from 10% -&gt; 25%) also now works.

Sadly, the backpack talent (lower the feedback loop cooldown to 10 seconds), which sounds incredibly potent still does NOT work. On the HUD, where our buffs appear, the HW symbol for feedback loop does indeed come off cooldown on 10 seconds, however it does not allow you to activate feedback loop again until the entire 20 second default duration is up. 

So, can you guys at Massive... **PLEASE** fix this already. I understand you are working from home and what not, but if you claim that you fixed something, wouldn’t you guys simply just test it to make sure that it’s fixed, and if it’s not fixed actually fix it before stating that it is? 

**And lastly, Stick Bomb still *does not* work with Hard-Wired**: As it goes on some weird double cooldown on the HUD, and it will proc feedback loop by itself without even using another skill, but will not reset it’s cooldown, and trying to reset the sticky bomb cooldown with Feedback Loop with another skill still won’t work. The Jammer/EMP pulse works in a very similar manner with HW, except it actually resets it’s own cooldown.",11,1585175126,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fozmu9/so_after_testing_hardwired_just_now_as_the_devs/,thedivision,1
fozktn,rubenalamina,"Contractor's gloves, Fox's Prayers and Hollow Man with their unique attributes have a bigger impact to gear, weapon and build diversity than DTE on masks previously had.","I will try to make my points as brief as I can and I would like to have a discussion about this and the negative impact it has on the gear and build system.

\### **Damage to Elites on masks before WoNY**

Any mask on any build that didn't have DTE was totally useless and forced a stat to always be present on that slot no matter what. So all the possible attribute combinations suffered a lot because 99% of the builds would have DTE and one other attribute. Not even skill builds could avoid not having it because it increased their skill dmg as well.

**### Damage to Armor, Damage to Targets Out of Cover and Damage to Health**

These are the equivalent of DTE and you are basically forced to run at least two if don't want to purposely gimp your build. DTH is less important so the Hollow Man is not a must equip item. However, Contractor's gloves and Fox's Prayer are a must equip item given how important DTA and OOC are for the vast majority of builds.

In WoNY we have more diversity of roles in group compositions so maybe healer and some tank builds can trade these off for other brand set or gear combinations for these builds.

If you want to make a DPS, hybrid, damage oriented CC or other kind of build that will deal damage with their weapons, you have to have these items. The problem is not that these two items are a must, it's the attributes themselves.

Why would you want to use other combination of attributes on your gloves or kneepads when you can have 11% DTA and 15% OOC. Weapons can roll 6% DTA and up to 12% OOC and both of these attributes are a multiplicative source of damage. It's obvious you want them on all our builds that are weapon or skill damage oriented.

**### Contractor's, Fox's Prayer and Hollow Man**

Having these items roll these unique attributes on gear (they can roll in weapons) makes builds that don't even use LMGs or Rifles use them. That means we are forced to have one, or in the majority of cases, two pieces with weapon damage we don't even use on a particular build.

This has the consequence of making LMGs and Rifles the more prevalent weapons at the moment when we finally have really good weapon diversity after all this time. Why would we use other weapon if we already need to have one item that gives use LMG Damage and one that gives us Rifle Damage.

The Hollow Man impact is smaller because DTH is a more niche damage stat and health not being a concern on armored NPCs doesn't force us to use this mask like the other two.

\### **Suggestions or solutions**

The most obvious solution to me is to remove these attributes from gear to not force them into our builds. I have thought about named items from brands having a unique damage bonus. Like Sokolov or Badger having a named item that rolls Damage to Targets in Close Range, for example.

The problem with trying to find alternatives and not removing these stats is that new or existing items that could potentially roll similar unique attributes will just force us to equip those pieces because the damage increases would be as significant as DTA and OOC. This also applies to any future named items that could potentially roll unique attributes oriented to other kind of builds. Like the Motherly Gloves giving you 20% Skill Health at the moment, which is probably an omission. If you want your shield to be the tankiest it can be, why would you ever want to run any other pair of gloves.

I can't honestly think of other solution that could solve this problem in a simple manner other than removing the attributes from gear. Maybe change some brand bonuses to be more powerful to compete against these items/attributes in our build making process?

If someone has any other suggestions or solutions, please discuss them here. I think we have a more healthier build and weapon diversity than ever before but having 2 slots out of 6 essentially locked to two specific items hurts the diversity a lot in weapon and skill damage oriented builds.",91,1585174934,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fozktn/contractors_gloves_foxs_prayers_and_hollow_man/,thedivision,1

My question: Is there any reason it would make sense to not make these and wait for them to possibly buff exotics? They don't seem very responsive to gear complaints, so maybe it would never happen. OTOH, I can only make these ""predictably"" one time, right? So maybe I should wait.

I've done the suggested trouble shooting steps from Ubisoft support forums and have the proper ports forwarded so just wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing this.

I don't know if it's weapons with a really high rate of fire AND reload speed, or some combination there of, but I'm noticing I'm getting shocked while attacking the same enemy with the same weapon \*before\* a reload.

 My Chatterbox seems to be a big culprit. I'll be laying into someone of the same polarity then suddenly I'm getting shocked, look down at the polarity of the weapon and it's different and I'm reloading. I notice that polarity shifts at the beginning of the reload, so it's like the polarity shifts AS the last round before the reload is hitting the enemy.

I suppose they chose to do it at the beginning to avoid being able to keep the same polarity by interrupting the reload...

foxdep,MagierMo,DPS Glitch - Why is there so much [.....] ?,"I have read and seen so much about DPS Glitch the last week. And again and again I had to ask myself the question: Where are the arguments?

All you hear/see is that bans are demanded and/or a reset of the leaderboard. But unfortunately the reason for these demands does not reveal itself to me. But let's try to clarify if these demands would change something and if all these claims are true.

&amp;#x200B;

**""The DPS glitch is ruining the game for everyone.""**

What exactly is he ruining it for you personally? Personally I haven't experienced a situation where I thought: ""This guy is taking all the fun out of playing DPS Glitch"". I can understand when someone signs up for a Legendary Mission in Matchmaking because they want to experience it. The thrill and sweaty hands in the hardest challenge in the game. But then suddenly everything goes super easy because 1 or 2 players in his matchmaking group are using the DPS Glitch. Now he could then leave the group and sign up again. But here I can already hear the calls: ""This is every matchmaking group."" Well, this is not true. In my test, in 30 matchmaking groups, there was one group where 2 people had the DPS glitch. But now I could also say: ""Who the hell signs up for the hardest challenge in matchmaking? I can understand that there are still players who want to play a multiplayer online game solo. No friends who play the same game or no clan that is active. All valid reasons. I think we all know how it went in the raid when the matchmaking for the ""Story"" mode was done. Only the fewest groups that were thrown together made it to the end. And the story mode for the raid is not really a challenge. Quite the opposite to Legendary Missions. They are a real challenge and without Voice practically not feasible.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Leaderboards""**

Yeah, the good old Leaderboards. Are now all filled with times that are incredible. Times that are shorter than I need to go to the bathroom to pee. But hey... aren't we forgetting something? The Leaderboards were already full of times that are unbelievable at TU6. In under four minutes through Lincoln Memorial on Challenging is not possible. And certainly not solo. It takes longer to just walk through the mission (without enemies). But has anyone complained? Was there a riot going on like this? Was there a loud call for bans? No. Nobody cared. Even the speedrunners said that you can't give anything to the leaderboards. If you really want to do speedruns that are also recognized you have to switch to other leaderboards. An example for such an alternative would be [https://www.speedrun.com/the\_division\_2](https://www.speedrun.com/the_division_2)

&amp;#x200B;

**""PvP""**

Yeah, that's a topic for discussion. Or maybe not? Before I heard about the DPS glitch I was in the DZ (Exotic Kneepads farm). My group was farming. We stood at the helicopter to fly our prey. Then suddenly another group showed up and attacked us. 3 of my group were immediately taken out and one player from the other group was also immediately on the ground. Then this happened incredibly. I had my rifle build on, but no rifle on but a SMG (1200 RPM). And what happened? With only one reload I took out the other three players. 45 bullets from the first mag and 10 more bullets from the second mag were enough to put three players on the ground. The whole thing did not take 10 seconds. Let's convert that to the DPS glitch.

3 players in 10 seconds without a DPS glitch

3 players in 5 seconds with DPS GLitch

You see for yourselves, don't you? The TTK in the DZ is abnormally small. No matter if with DPS Glitch or without.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Loot""**

Many people come with the argument that people can get better loot faster with DPS Glitch. I wanted to check it out myself, so I ""got"" the glitch and started farming Solo District Union Arena and I kept farming until I collected 100 items. And then I evaluated all the items. And what did you come up with? Well, from the 100 items there were exactly 3 items with higher Rolls than I already had in the database. This means that I was able to farm exactly three items with the DPS glitch. But don't worry. Since I knew that I was going to be blamed for getting 3 items, I destroyed those items. Just like the other 97 items from all the runs with the DPS glitch. I couldn't destroy the fun I had and for that I want to apologize to all players. I accept the punishment.

&amp;#x200B;

**""The End""**

Perhaps a factual discussion is possible here and I hope that some of the arguments here will give more weight to the whole uprising. Just to say that you are destroying the game for everyone is just not right. Nobody ruined the game for me. If then the users of the DPS Glitch destroy themselves the game if they have all the good stuff in 1 week and then have no motivation to continue because they already have it all.",41,1585167426,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/foxdep/dps_glitch_why_is_there_so_much/,thedivision,1

fox5bv,Treyshaun,[Suggestion] PvE damage reduction for blue primary attributes,"As the title states, I think it would be beneficial for blue builds to receive a small PvE damage reduction going forward. 

With the newest update, blue builds are STILL under performing. Given the current state of the game and enemies ability to shred player armor in a matter of a seconds (regardless of player armor values), I believe adding a 3-5% PvE damage reduction per primary blue attribute would allow blue build to viably resurface. 

A flat 15-25% flat damage reduction is not at all ridiculous. Combined with the primary armor attribute already granted by blues (and subsequently, the loss in damage/utility by not wearing a red or yellow piece), blue builds would be able to do as they're intended - get in the face of the enemy of not give a single fuck.

Now, this is just an idea, and a poorly extrapolated one at that, but I think it has some decent potential. What are your opinions?",14,1585166699,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fox5bv/suggestion_pve_damage_reduction_for_blue_primary/,thedivision,1

This is my first post here so be gentle. 

A buddy in my clan was using the Sniper Turret with his DPS build so I decided to give it a go with a proper skill build and it is so much fun! Challenging is easily solo-able and Heroic is doable if you're very careful. 

I'm not an elite player or anything but I tried my hand at making a video to showcase stuff.

The rundown:

* 4 Pieces of Hardwired
* Acosta's Go-Bag (overcharge!)
* The Send-Off shotgun (Technician Field Research recipe for Perfectly Rooted)

Secondary skill I usually swap between Hive and Assault drone for area control or drive targets out of cover.

Does anyone know if the contractor's gloves will allow the skills to receive the damage to armor or is it limited to your firearms?

fovpjo,decker12,Div 2 still consistently Crashes. tried everything. Looking for something I missed.,"Hey everyone, I know the content in /r/thedivision isn't usually filled bug or tech support issues, but I'm quite literally out of ideas and wondering if anyone else has seen this crash.

Pretty much every game session, after about 45 minutes to an hour, my game will freeze for about 4 seconds, then drop out of full screen to a frozen Windowed mode (showing the same thing I saw when it froze in Full Screen), and then crash to the Ubisoft launcher, with uPlay asking for a crash report. I can reload the game, play for another 45 minutes to an hour, and have the same thing.

It usually happens during periods of movement, but not always. Doesn’t matter if playing solo or with friends. I’ll be walking around, shooting enemies, following my friends, and clunk, freeze, drop to windowed mode, crash.

This has been happening since last year when the game was released. It has persisted between title updates, between patches, between everything. It happened again only last night, and it happened twice in two hours. None of my friends or clan mates have this crash – hell, none of them ever seem to crash, period.

My gut tells me that it crashes during periods of resource loading or graphical effects, but I can’t be 100% sure. It seems like it happens mostly during firefights, but it also happens while just walking around. I don’t recall it ever happening at the shooting range or while screwing with my inventory.

Now I know what you’re thinking, oh it could be any one of these 10 simple things for me to try to fix the crashing! Hey Decker12, try updating your drivers! Try reinstalling the game! Oh, let me tell you what I’ve tried. First, here’s my rig:

* I7 / 6700k (no OC)
* 1080ti (no OC) running at 144p @144hz (averaging about 80 – 90 fps on High/Ultra settings with DX12)
* 32GB of Memory
* Samsung Evo SSDs
* Water cooled CPU

From March 2019 to January 2020, the game was crashing the same way even though I had tried the usual driver updates (I always stay up to date on Nvidia drivers) and reinstalling the game, without success.

Not a GPU temperature issue, I’ve graphed GPU temps many times while playing and no correlation. Not a CPU temperature issue either. Also took off DX12 mode and still, same crash.

Downgraded Nvidia drivers several times over the past 12 months, to various versions, to see if that was the problem. It wasn’t.

As a last resort, in Feb 2020 I completely reinstalled Windows 10 from a freshly created Windows 10 v1909 UBS stick. I didn’t upgrade, didn’t keep any settings, and I erased the drive entirely and started over from scratch. All latest drivers, all latest updates. I re-downloaded Div 2 fresh, as well.
Even with this 100% fresh and new and clean system, Div 2 still crashed the same way.

My system is 100% rock solid on every other game and program I own. Literally, out of all my games on Steam, uPlay, Epic, everything - Division 2 is the only game that crashes. And it crashes the exact same way, every time, every play session. The only game I own that crashes before and after a full W10 reinstall.

I’m genuinely out of ideas on what to try. I’m an IT guy and have been building systems for 20 years so I’m not going in completely dark to whatever this could be. If a completely fresh, clean, new Windows 10 can’t run Division 2 on my high-ish-end but not exactly rare system without crashing, what else can it be?",9,1585161949,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fovpjo/div_2_still_consistently_crashes_tried_everything/,thedivision,1

fov3c9,mjsheehan0611,Deflector Shield Broken,"Before the expansion I ran the Deflector Shield skill a couple times for fun. I also specifically remember standing with two random mobs in front of me testing how the targeting worked for it and how I would need to aim at enemies for the deflected bullets to target properly and land. With enemies in front of me, every bullet impacted the shield and it seemed to work as intended.

Now, I just spent time farming a build to try out the shield again. But it now only works intermittently. So guys will start shooting at me, I’ll hear the bullets deflect and see them take damage, but now the skill seems to randomly shut off. The shield will remain out, but as I get shot nothing deflects and I take the damage directly. I’ve tested this at different elevations and with different factions and enemies; it doesn’t matter. The skill just randomly stops working for moments at a time making it often lethal to rely on it.

But then enemies in say, any street in federal triangle are nowhere near this difficult.

fotld2,da3strikes,PSA: Hard Wired Backpack Talent Still Doesn't Work,"There's a lot of misinformation about Hard Wired talents working now.  This is incorrect, at least with regard to the backpack talent.  You know, the important one...  The skill CD refresh is not reduced to 10 seconds with the backpack and the actual CD is still 20 seconds.  

This is super easy to test.

Run cluster seekers as Skill 1. Run hive as Skill 2.  Run 4-piece HW and backpack (purportedly reduces 4-piece CD to 10 seconds).

Cast Skill 1 --&gt; Cast Skill 2 --&gt; Skill 1 CD resets --&gt; a damage buff icon now appears (20 second duration) and a CD icon now appears (10 second duration) --&gt; Cast Skill 1 again to put it on CD.

When the 10 second CD icon expires, cast Skill 2 again (the buff icon is still up).  Skill 1 does not refresh and the buff icon does not refresh. Wait for damage buff icon to expire, then cast Skill 2 again. Skill 1 will then refresh and damage buff icon will refresh.

**Conclusion:**  The tooltips are correct and last the correct time.  However, skill CDs cannot be refreshed until the damage buff expires (20 seconds). Which means the backpack is still doing nothing at all and the actual CD on skill CD refresh is still 20 seconds.",5,1585154864,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fotld2/psa_hard_wired_backpack_talent_still_doesnt_work/,thedivision,1

foshuh,Exobian,I hope heroic is not nerfed too much!,"I still haven’t had the chance of trying the new update but I’m worried that heroic is now super easy which will make me lose interest in the game. 

Yes i will admit, on 4 players, enemies were a bit on the spongy side and their damage output was high but it was by no means game breaking. 

After optimizing my builds, i was able to change my world to heroic 10 days ago and now all I do is heroic missions and strongholds. 
I matchmake with randos and always play 4 man team ( max scaling) and the difficulty varies from normal to challenging in my opinion. 
Everything non black tusk is kind of easy tbh. 
All the wony missions on 4 man heroic are easy. 
Black tusk missions vary from ok to challenging (tidal and manning)
I’m not in a position to play legendary yet. It’s seems way too hard and requires a coordinated team however i mostly play with randos.

fosey9,CHAOGamer,"So how is the PvP balanced? Is it ""normalized"" at all?","Was playing DZ and Conflict for some time, and I've noticed several things. First of all, all and every single player I encounter has the double amount of armor that I have, so I have no chance of not going down before they do. Second of all, if anyone uses their gadgets on me (which means seeker mine only), this destroys all of my armor. Not to mention the fact that every single player except me now owns WONY, so they have 50% higher possible skills on their gear at the very least.

The players I encounter have \~ the same gear score level than I do, so what am I doing wrong? Would be cool if anyone could suggest me a somewhat OP build, so I can have a small chance.

fosa6l,RodTheModStewart,When to start Warlords and what to potentially finish before I head to NY,"Picked up the expansion when I found out it takes place in my old neighborhood but knew I wanted to finish the base game before I lept in.  Almost entirely a solo player btw.  Now I think I know the answer to this, but after finishing the main campaign and triggering endgame, this would be the ""ideal"" time to hop into the expansion right?  Few other questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* I largely neglected the gear donation part of the Projects.  Almost all of them remain unfinished.   
 Should I finish these before heading over or did i miss the boat by triggering the endgame?  Prob should for access to the mods or does that not matter?
* Should I collect the new SHD caches that spawned when the endgame started or prioritize finding the few that were annoying and I skipped?  Anything else to finish before heading over?  I have a ton of unused SHD points because I sort of settled into the flying turrent drone and rolling ball grenade thing (certainly open to suggestions there for better solo skills).
* I never bothered to go into the DZ because it seemed like a waste of time now that level is 40.  Did I miss out on anything there or should I hold off?
* When should I do Coney Island?  Any other content?  
* Once in NY, besides building my 30+ library of those unique skill things off gear, any other suggestions/priorities you might suggest?  I've heard the streets are ROUGH (7 flamethrower heavies??).  
* Specializations are entirely new to me and have not really been touched so far.  How much will this hamstring me?  I just got that grenade launcher thing.  Seems...useful?

&amp;#x200B;

forylv,pkpzp228,I think the Polarity Event is Great!,"I just came back to the game after around a year or so off for WONY.  I thought that was tons of fun.  

This polarity event though, it's exactly what I want out of a seasonal event.  It reminds me of a Diablo 3 season, it forces me to play in a different play style than I'm used to.  I noticed right away that it was going to force me to get more comfortable with my second primary weapon.  Since coming back, I've been running primarily a rifle with an LMG in the second slot for dealing with armor.  Now I have to be much more strategic about which enemy I prioritize and get much more comfortable with using that LMG at different ranges.

Anywho, I saw a lot criticism of it yesterday but I think the event is spot on.

PSA: I like to run with fog of war on for the sake being less coddled and the challenge.  The directives fog of war and the limited ammo one lend themselves really well to this event.  fog of war is basically free 25% experience right now, normally you'd need to run pulse to survive without the minimap but since enemies are tagged with polarity you get it for free, you just have to deal with no directional indicators for enemy fire.  The management of polarity is basically the same strategy as the ammo directive, run your guns before reloading and prioritize those that your current gun is most effective against.  

I don't know if those directive dynamics were intentional, if they were I think the whole thing is pretty well thought out.",7,1585149259,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/forylv/i_think_the_polarity_event_is_great/,thedivision,1

for76s,erickiceboyxxp,Taking a break or leave of permanent absence,"I’m a diehard division fan and have been since the launch of division 1. I just feel like right now the game is in a miserable state. The builds don’t feel as diverse as division 1, such as D3 or even strikers classified. There was sustainability with dps builds back then and even in the update before this one (TU7? I believe). I honestly feel like gear 2.0 ruined this game’s build diversity. 

Before this update, you could pump out crazy damage and have extreme survivability. For example, hitting extremely hard with an lmg with patience to keep you alive. The dps builds don’t have enough sustainability and only work well in groups. I’m just unhappy with this game’s overall state right now. It’s just not fun anymore for me. Skill builds are pretty decent but tanks and dps builds are in a weird position for me. They don’t have enough sustainability and each one is lacking what the other should have. 

The tank is lacking damage and the dps is lacking proper survivability. I’ve tried to do a hybrid between the two but it’s just not to the same level of TU7. I’m fine with them forming a new structure, but builds just feel linear now. There was an immense amount of build diversity in TU7 and exotic weapons felt powerful. The only exotic weapon worth getting is the eagle bearer and pestilence. The only content worth playing for me right now is the raid and legendary missions. Those two require communication, synergy and absolute potent builds. The dps build works for the raid because you have supportive players running tardigrade and other helpful items. Again, dps only works well in groups. As for legendary missions, I utilize my healer or sniper turret skill builds. Solo play is miserable because dps builds are heavily punished and I have to utilize tank shield builds for proper success. Yes, I have farmed like crazy and constructed all types of builds.. I’m definitely not new to the experience. I have a bunch of max rolled items with dps and armor. I’ve tried making a bunch of builds work but they all struggle with sustainability.  I may just hop on every week to play the raid with my group or do some legendaries every once in a while. 

Gear 2.0 may have made things less confusing, but boy did it remove so much potential for builds by killing off multiple talents, changing mods and etc.. patience is now armor regen but it makes you sacrifice damage attributes and there is not much of a hybrid approach. There’s too much of a sacrifice with my tank and dps builds. Idk man.. I love this game so much but I’m just unhappy with its current state.

foqx4a,Terribly_indecent,More stupid new player questions,"Ok, I got to 30.  It took me 48 hours or so give or take, and for the most part was super fun.  Was thrust into world tier 1 with a few side missions and control points left to clear once the last stronghold was cleared.  Now I'm in a spot where I'm scratching my head about some things.

1. Does the game nerf clothing drops once you get out of base game?  I was picking up 2-4 items per session before I progressed to world tier 1 and now I haven't gotten any in at least 2 days (progressed on sunday, I've spent monday and tuesday in tier1).  Clothing is legit my favorite thing about this game so far.
2. Is there a blueprint for the classic m1a, and if so is it a mission reward or some kind of rando drop?  I saw that theres a 1911 blueprint but it looks to be a random reward.
3. I picked demolitionist as my first spec.  I tried sharpshooter but I really don't like sniping in this game. I get that there's a reward of 5 points for doing invaded missions, but there is a finite amount of those.  to get to 160 points are you looking at a whole lot of grinding after doing the invaded missions? How do you make up enough points to max out all of the other specs beyond your first, or can you?
4. Once you're into wt1 it seems like theres constant conflict in the control points.  That makes sense, having to fight over them like that.  But what about the campus?  Those black tusk bastards won't leave the place alone.  Do you ever get to stop retaking that signal jammer or whatever it is?  I need to be able to fast travel to the campus to check vendor for blueprints.
5. Speaking of vendors, currently  I have white house, clan, crafting table, theater and campus vendors.  Am I missing any?
6. Why on earth is the lever action rifle so compelling?  Its like in this fantasy world where you can find machine guns in boxes littered all over the streets of washington dc suddenly the game gives you some cowboy shit and you're running around like its red dead redemption.  Might as well give people crossbows.....
7. lastly, I did my first world tier 1 stronghold and got sent to world tier 2.  I don't think I was ready to go to wt2 yet.  Can I go back?

I went to use [https://divisionbuilder.com/](https://divisionbuilder.com/) yesterday to find it was extremely outdated. I am wondering what resources you are using now to design your builds.

Some reading on the discord associated with the tool, it seems the developer has gone rogue, not responding to commutations and not sharing access to the codebase. I saw some people may or may not be working on a replacement, however very little information was available.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering building a new version of this site if this is something people would want, however I am also a student for the next month or so, so it will not be my top priority. If I do this, I will be hosting it on Github and allow people to work with me on it.

After that I was pretty quick able to set my world setting on hard, and shortly after that to challenging.
Now I do have a build that I'm pretty happy with. 
I can run CP4's without problems and can run all the missions on challenging as well without struggling.
I also can do heroic, but I just prefer running challenging...

I just can't understand why people would start to begin whining 3 days after WONY was released that they are struggeling in heroic mode...or that the drops are too bad...
What are these people expecting?
Finish the story mode, play for one or two hours and then start to run heroic mode as a single agent, clear everything without problems and loot god rolls and exotics all the time?
If that would be the case there would be absolutely nothing left in the game that these agents could possibly do...

Now with the new update this morning most people just keep on all the whining...
For 90% of these agents I simply can't understand why...
Ubisoft was listening to almost all of your complaints and they were coming towards you making changes.
Yes, of course there is still lots of stuff broken that has to be patched (set bonuses, and many more), but at least they are reacting! Plus imo they are reacting pretty fast.

So for closing I have to say:
Please stop complaining every day about the same topics. 
If you can't run missions on heroic, just play on challenging...
If there is no exotic dropping for you - stop the farming and do something else...
Don't just copy and paste that there is no build diversity, try to create your own build! There are several that are working and pretty fun to play also!
If you don't have a god-rolled item, just go and farm targeted loot...One day it will drop!
And maybe you also try to create a good team with different builds to play that endgame stuff with difficult contents.

Give us back the exotics as they were pre WoNY, they were good, they were fun! - all you had to do was add more loot, more exotics, not change them all to be completely useless and boring!?

Seriously, Yellow gear items with the standard talents are now far more useful and more fun to use than the old (and most new) exotics are now... what's the point? why did you even bother giving us new exotics if they were going to be this rubbish?

Does anyone actually play the game after these changes? how have you, as a studio full of developers, not noticed that the exotics are absolutely no longer any fun to use anymore? it baffles the mind how you can be so blind.

foq3n4,feck1t,so what are people looking for challenging content but rely on MM are supposed to do now with the nerfs to heroic?,"Hi all,

I've seen it coming and now here we are.

Heroics -with decent builds - have been fairly easy by now already, while still providing some challenge and it was good fun.

As someone that strictly is using ingame MM and is not interested in using 3rd party tools like discord to look for and run missions I pretty much have nothing to do anymore.

I'm not really interested in running Legendaries since you need communication and decent groups for them. 

So not only you need 3rd party tools to find groups, but you also have to hang in discord and then communicate with people which I have no interest in at all.

So now, I only can chose between something I have no interest in and something that potentially won't provide a challenge anymore (and hence no incentive to play, the same way it was prior to WONY).

fooxzh,FL1NTZ,Massive: Can We Have A Way to Increase Level On Exotics?,"Hi Massive!

I was wondering, can we have the ability upgrade our older exotics to level cap?  I know it probably won't happen during this season, but I think it would be awesome to consider this for the next one.

The reason why I'm making this request/suggestion is because of how rare exotics are. When I get one, it feels pretty damn cool.  But when the level cap raises, I feel that invalidates the effort and doesn't respect a player's time put into getting them. There was this ability in The Division 1, but it was available to ALL loot and to me, that was a mistake. I actually enjoy the grind for gear to make builds. But for exotics, it just isn't the same because of the rarity.

I know there will be some that disagree and that's fine.  This is for my personal experience and it may match others who feel the same.  Either way, please take this into consideration.

fooe35,AnOuterHaven,Ruru's Percentage-Based Healing Build (CC/Revive),"Hello, I am Ruru/FatesForetold, I'm a skill and tank player that runs Legendaries and Heroics (usually) without a hitch. Now for your consideration, I would like to introduce the concept of percentage-based healing. As of writing, I run no Chem Launcher or Restorer Hive on any of my builds. Why's that? Because neither of these skills offer any utility to my pubs when they go down, a common occurrence in public matchmaking. I always assume that my pubs will do something incredibly dumb and utilizing proactive, preventative means of healing (Chem Launcher) or a means of healing that doesn't have 100% uptime (Restorer Hive) isn't the way to save your Heroic runs when your allies are doing everything possible to throw it. Enter the Reviver Hive.

Why the Reviver Hive? Because it's a reactive means of healing that, with this build, is constantly up. With six skill tier and one revived armor mod, I am accomplishing 93% revived armor. You don't have to peek and aim with Chem Launcher, you don't have to wait on your Restorer Hive to build charges, all you have to do is throw a reviver hive when someone goes down or instruct your pubs to wipe so they can come back with full health.

For my build, I've chosen to use a Hard Wired four piece, Acosta's Go-Bag and Hana-U Kneepads, all rolled for Status Effect (60%). I am running Status Effect because Skill Healing seems to have zero effect on the amount of armor someone is revived with. Even if it did, 93% is close enough to 100% anyways. Optimally, you'd want to run a Hana-U Chest with the mod slot rerolled for Utility (Skill Haste) and run Overwatch on it, but it's not necessary for base functionality. With this set, every 20 seconds, when you use one skill, your other skill will come off cooldown. You will use this functionality to refresh your Reviver Hive, so whichever CC skill you want to utilize, you will need to get the cooldown as close to 20 seconds as possible.

My preferred choice is the Banshee Pulse because of its low CD and ease of use. With minimal Skill Haste, I'm able to get Banshee Pulse to a 20.3 second CD on a 12.8 second duration. This mitigates basically all the damage (Heavies may still shoot and Warhounds are unaffected). While not as strong as a full CC build, this is normally enough for most content and I've done Legendaries without either a dedicated healer or CC player, since I can accomplish both to a reasonable degree. 

The playstyle is very simple, CC enemies, chill in the back. If someone dies, revive them with the hive and pick it up. If, for some reason, the ally you need to revive is far away from you, you can map-wide CC enemies with an overcharged Banshee, run across the map and throw the hive at them. Your allies will quickly understand that every 20 seconds, they will have 13 seconds to deal as much damage as possible, and seven seconds where if they die, they will be full health in under two seconds.

Now the cons of the build are that you do not heal a tank's shield, it's wacky to explain to pubs (""Kill yourselves lmao"") and for Legendary Missions, White Tusk will actually run INTO cover while CC'd with Banshee Pulse. There's also the issue where if you die, you lose all your hive charges, but the tradeoff is that you at least revive. Probably the most annoying is that DPS players tend to run Banshee as well, so your pulse will have reduced effectiveness on enemies that are closer to the front.",10,1585134031,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fooe35/rurus_percentagebased_healing_build_ccrevive/,thedivision,1

fonsql,MojokojoXD,Factions strengths and weaknesses,"Ok I usually don't post on much on here but I was thinking the other day that almost every faction based game I've played usually have some pretty noticeable strengths and weaknesses by virtue of their lore. For example, for those of you familiar with the Warhammer universe, orcs and Tyranids are known to use numbers to overwhelm the enemy but back to the division 2 I don't really notice any of that. Aside from the tech they use, there isn't any strategy behind them. They all seem to only rush and flank your position.

I short I'd like to see more defined roles based in their lore. I don't expect the hyenas to be on par marksman wise with the true sons or black tusks. Maybe they could use less cover, be less accurate with conventional weapons, use more melee weapons or home made weapons. I don't know where a group of gang members would find an engineer to join them. I think the outcasts and true sons are well designed. I don't know if I'm making any sense but these were my midnight division thoughts.",7,1585130755,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fonsql/factions_strengths_and_weaknesses/,thedivision,1

fomwxx,kestononline,Skill Mod values need re-adjustment (auto-conversions had funky results),"I think they did a lot of auto-conversions of the mod and values, but many of them are near pointless.

Example:
- Booster Hive value at Tier 6 is 16%. The mod that adds 9% stim efficiency adds around 0.9% for a total of 16.9%. A boost that minor on a number that is small to begin with makes no sense.
- Gunner’s special/free mod is Radius... which seemingly has no effect on Banshee pulse.  Cone Size is what affects it the range and angle.

There are many more nonsensical results from the mass auto-converting of the mods. It’s obvious much of this was not tested/validated.

So I think Massive needs to re-visit the skill mod values and adjust so that they are somewhat useful to even equip. I understand they would like the majority of the enhancement to come from skill-tier, which is fine... but there should be some POINT to equipping a mod.",5,1585125640,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fomwxx/skill_mod_values_need_readjustment/,thedivision,1

Yesterday, I was playing with 3 other people, and we were all using proper GS510-515 equipment/builds.

Nevertheless, even when ALL 4 of us were emptying a full magazine on a single elite enemy, the guy had still armor left, and was able to almost one shot 2 of us.

On top of that, there seems to be a huge increase in medics. At the certain point, we encountered a group of elite, including 2 Elite medics and 2 Veteran medics, all spamming AOE healing skills, running around like FLASH on steroids (superhero) and reviving their comrades like no tomorrow....
Obviously, we focussed on the medics, but killing a group like this takes ages.

Experienced the same in several other missions over the last couple of days.

fom3tj,onframe,Global Event structure feels underwhelming.,"Right off the bat got to say I still love the expansion, but I want to launch some criticism regarding this event, to maybe help shape futures ones.

So I'm moving to obvious comparison, TD1 Global Events. They allowed players to choose how severe effects would be, also gave players more points if they run it at the hardest GE mode, here there is only 1 mode and it's annoying. I ground the first day challenges on Normal difficulty quickly and I don't want to touch it again, because what's the point? In TD1 I could grind GE points to earn all the rewards and grind my gear that way, here playing GE rules without Challenges is annoying, counterproductive and pointless.

Instead of the global modifier, add directives for missions and open world, each directive increases the severity of the mechanics player has to deal with but rewards them with more currency they can exchange for good gear in a GE shop, just like you did in TD1.

Please Massive in some cases there is no need to remake something that wasn't broken, imagine a GE shop which sells exotic cache for a good sum of points, even with meh rolls people would grind that shit nonstop.

The GE mechanic itself is fine, but there is literally 0 point on doing it outside challenges and it's kinda sad. Not a global event, but an optional event for sure, seems like another League with a different meme tbh.",11,1585120966,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fom3tj/global_event_structure_feels_underwhelming/,thedivision,1

To combat any problem of deafening other players, a VOIP volume cap would be required if there isn't one already.

3. Attempt at Navy Hill. I reach the place, engage the first enemy and get rushed by two shield rushers while a thrower dumps one of those explosive smoke grenades right on top of me that detonates instantly.  
4. Attempt at Navy Hill. I run into a patrol on the way and a yellow shield rusher runs at me and forces me out of cover giving his two machine gunners an opportunity to burst me down in half a second.

I logged out after that. On every attempt I got killed earlier until I could not even reach the place anymore. I was scared that, if I respawn, the cleaners are going to storm the safehouse.

A Tank can:

1. Attract enemy fire, hence granting opportunities for DPS to deal damage safely.

2. Push enemies out of cover.

3. Give team bonus armour.


A CC can:

1. Disable enemies and their gadgets for a long time

2. Force enemies out of cover, due to status effects like Blind, Burning, etc.

3. Protect team from being rushed/suppressed.

I’ve recently gotten into this game and am having a blast, but I have a question I can’t seem to lock down the answer to.

So if I farm the targeted area anything I do that drops targeted LMG has a chance to drop pestilence?

So if I’m just running around doing target practices, hostages, control points, etc... I’ll eventually get it in that LMG targeted loot area. Is this correct?

foga81,JokerUnique,The Division 2 - Title Update 8.4 – Balancing Feedback,"#Title Update 8.4 – Balancing Feedback

The difficulty has been a constant discussion since Title Update 8 dropped. 

&amp;nbsp;

With Title Update 8.4 the difficulties and the scaling of the NPCs got a rebalance. On top of that, the new Black Tusk units were changed and the PVP also got an adjustment. 

This should have a significant impact on all difficulties and if you play solo or in a group. 

&amp;nbsp;

##Incremental Changes

As the developers have stated, they plan to add these balancing changes incrementally to see how things develop and have also highlighted, that things still can change depending on the feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

##Please Provide Feedback
So let us look at the different difficulties, solo and group play and collect the different experiences. 

&amp;nbsp;

***
##**Balancing changes:**  
  
**Developer Note:**  
The game was tuned in a way that playing the exact same enemy composition at higher difficulties and higher player counts would match to the expected gear of that difficulty and extra players added. However, since the game also adds more Elites and Veterans to accommodate higher difficulty and player counts, this caused tuning to overcompensate health and damage higher than intended.  We are thus lowering many of these values.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

*   Reduce NPC Damage output for all difficulties.
*   This applies to all NPCs and activities and enemies will do less damage to players compared to their current damage output.
*   Reduce NPC Health and Amor for group scaling.
*   Enemy Health and Armor scaling for 2-, 3- and 4-player groups based on Veterancy.
*   This means Red, Veteran, Elite and Named enemies will have their Health and Armor reduced compared to their current values.
*   Additionally, we are adjusting Health and Armor based on activity difficulty.
*   This applies to Hard and Challenging difficulties where enemies will have lower Health and Armor compared to their current values.
*   An exception are Heroic and Legendary difficulty enemies which will have their Health and Armor increased to compensate for the group scaling reductions to their values.

&amp;nbsp;

**Developer Note:** We still intend Heroic and Legendary to be very challenging. Therefore, we are increasing the base difficulty to account for the health reductions for co-op scaling. Compared to now this means Heroic and Legendary will be a bit harder for solo players and 2-player groups, 3-player difficulty will stay roughly the same, and 4-player difficulty will be easier.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

###Black Tusk Changes
*   Black Tusk specific adjustments which went live earlier last week
*   Reduced the health of Warhounds.
*   Reduced damage of Warhound Sniper.
*   Reduced the damage of the 360 spin of Warhound minigun.
*   Increased the intention icon duration of the 360 spin from Warhound Minigun to give players more time to react.
*   Reduced weak point health of Warhound Grenadier’s Control Unit.
*   Support Station
*   Reduced Base Health of Support Station.
*   Adjusted health scaling of Support Station with Veterancies.
*   Increased likelihood of Support Stations being deployed in the open (away from cover).
*   EMP effects will now damage the Support Station.

&amp;nbsp;
  
###Lvl 30 WT1-WT5 Content  
*   NPC Damage, Health and Armor will receive additional reductions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Developer Note:** Pre-Warlords of New York content has lower maximum values to weapon damage, skill damage, and armor (etc.) than level 31+ content so difficulty is now tuned separately for pre-expansion world tier content.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
###PvP Balance Changes:  
*   All PvP weapon damage: - 20%
*   PvP Rifles: an additional -10%
*   PvP MMRs: an additional -10%

&amp;nbsp;

###Skills  
*   Cluster Seeker Mine:
*   Reduced distance to bull charge from 12m to 10m.
*   Reduced distance from end to explode from 6m to 4m.

&amp;nbsp;

**Developer Note:** These changes should make the Cluster Seeker Mine feel a bit more responsive.

fog1i0,AGoodGeek,Targeted Loot Farming,"Hello Agents

I’ve been reading a lot of posts lately regarding Control Points, resetting them, farming them, etc.
A common complaint I see is that if CP’s don’t reset then farming targeted loot is difficult.  I have yet to experience this difficulty, and I actually like the idea of CPs that stay in friendly control, however I’ve never captured 100% of CPs so perhaps I’m missing something.

For folks that have “controlled the board,” do open world events like public executions, hostage rescues, propaganda broadcasts, territory controls, Elite patrols, target practices just disappear when all CP’s are green?  Is that the reason for the complaint?  I’ve controlled maybe 75% at a single time, but even then, open world activities were still plentiful and they’ve provided me with a lot of targeted loot I’ve actually wanted.",6,1585093781,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fog1i0/targeted_loot_farming/,thedivision,1

Maybe all of a sudden I'm just bad, but my exact build from last night can't seem to hold up to these NPCs now even with the Global Event-- I can certainly tell they have more armor/health, but it also feels like they have more damage, too. I haven't done a mission in a group of 4 yet, so I don't know if that's better than it was, but I honestly didn't have much of a problem pre-8.4 with group scaling on Heroic, either.

Unless this is part of the Global Event? If that's the case, the damage buff for attacking same-polarity enemies needs to be increased dramatically. Didn't Trick say something about it being very rewarding, but also very punishing? I'm certainly feeling the punish; I don't know about the rewarding, though.

foffa7,Acromaton,A discussion on Difficulty.,"So we all know that we hate sponge's running around and taking us down, but how do we increase the difficulty rating without artificially scaling it up with health and armor changes? One mission came to my mind on just the sheer difficulty of it, since it's near impossible for me to complete it on Hard by myself right now even with finishing other missions at Challenging. 

DARPA Labs to me was a good step in the difficulty rating. While there are a lot of instances of bullet-sponges making the mission harder, there are other nuisances within the mission that increase the difficulty. Forcing me to constantly reposition, being EMP'd, suppressed, or flanked. It constantly challenged me into changing my playstyle since I couldn't just mindlessly mow down enemies and finish the mission. 

The last part of the mission especially, regardless of the absurd amount of damage Petris dishes out, the encounter constantly forced me into new cover, and I was constantly vigilant about my flanks due to the number of enemies produced throughout the encounter. There are many things that make the mission ridiculously difficult that is prevalent throughout the rest of the game and deeply permeated into this mission. 

What I'm seeing through the mission, and what a lot of players are echoing as well, is the difficulty can be there without the health advantages given to the enemies. Enemies flanking you to attack instead of running headfirst in your direction, mechanics to force you out of cover, being suppressed and being careful not to just throw caution to the wind and fire into enemies. All of these things come down to the AI being as smart as they say they are, and actually doing what they're supposed to. Seems to me Black Tusk and True Sons are the only two that actually attempt to flank me, Outcasts/Cleaners/Rikers/Hyenas all just try to either sit in the back and pop shots, or run head first at me without me being able to counter their play.",4,1585091606,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/foffa7/a_discussion_on_difficulty/,thedivision,1

We are still evaluating several changes that are coming in on the server-side and will update this post to reflect any changes.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
***
##**Gameplay changes**  
  

*   Seasonal Manhunt is changed to allow progress at Normal difficulty and above. This will make playing together easier as all players will gain progress no matter what difficulty was set by the group leader.
*   Seasonal Manhunt is receiving a button in the Manhunt UI that allows players to reset the Manhunt to replay it. This allows players to reset the progress specifically and without changing the Global Difficulty.
*   This also means changing the Global Difficulty will not reset the Seasonal Manhunt and players are required to reset it via the Seasonal Manhunt UI.
*   Coyote’s Mask will drop from Coyote with an increased drop chance on higher difficulties.
*   We are also looking into providing the Mask for players that have not received them even though they reached Season Rank 35.
*   Increasing the reward quality for the following Open World Activities to be in line with other activities: Public Execution, Settlement Blockade and Propaganda Broadcast.
*   Reward caches from Conflict matches at maximum level are now of High-End quality.

&amp;nbsp;

*   Reduce NPC Damage output for all difficulties.
*   This applies to all NPCs and activities and enemies will do less damage to players compared to their current damage output.
*   Reduce NPC Health and Amor for group scaling.
*   Enemy Health and Armor scaling for 2-, 3- and 4-player groups based on Veterancy.
*   This means Red, Veteran, Elite and Named enemies will have their Health and Armor reduced compared to their current values.
*   Additionally, we are adjusting Health and Armor based on activity difficulty.
*   This applies to Hard and Challenging difficulties where enemies will have lower Health and Armor compared to their current values.
*   An exception are Heroic and Legendary difficulty enemies which will have their Health and Armor increased to compensate for the group scaling reductions to their values.

  
**Developer Note:** We still intend Heroic and Legendary to be very challenging. Therefore, we are increasing the base difficulty to account for the health reductions for co-op scaling. Compared to now this means Heroic and Legendary will be a bit harder for solo players and 2-player groups, 3-player difficulty will stay roughly the same, and 4-player difficulty will be easier.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

###Black Tusk Changes
*   Black Tusk specific adjustments which went live earlier last week
*   Reduced the health of Warhounds.
*   Reduced damage of Warhound Sniper.
*   Reduced the damage of the 360 spin of Warhound minigun.
*   Increased the intention icon duration of the 360 spin from Warhound Minigun to give players more time to react.
*   Reduced weak point health of Warhound Grenadier’s Control Unit.
*   Support Station
*   Reduced Base Health of Support Station.
*   Adjusted health scaling of Support Station with Veterancies.
*   Increased likelihood of Support Stations being deployed in the open (away from cover).
*   EMP effects will now damage the Support Station.

&amp;nbsp;
  
###Lvl 30 WT1-WT5 Content  
*   NPC Damage, Health and Armor will receive additional reductions.

**Developer Note:** Pre-Warlords of New York content has lower maximum values to weapon damage, skill damage, and armor (etc.) than level 31+ content so difficulty is now tuned separately for pre-expansion world tier content.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
###PvP Balance Changes:  
*   All PvP weapon damage: - 20%
*   PvP Rifles: an additional -10%
*   PvP MMRs: an additional -10%

&amp;nbsp;

###Skills  
*   Cluster Seeker Mine:
*   Reduced distance to bull charge from 12m to 10m.
*   Reduced distance from end to explode from 6m to 4m.

**Developer Note:** These changes should make the Cluster Seeker Mine feel a bit more responsive.

I put hundreds of rounds into him, blast him at point blank with a shotgun and nothing has gotten close to killing him. Add this together with his skill spawn rate of roughly every 5-10 seconds and his heal instantly putting him to full armor I just can find a way to kill him.

fodzwm,Dngu136,Questions about WoNY DLC,"So I bought Division 2 a little over a month ago and have put in nearly 100 hours. Enjoyed the game a lot, and have considered buying the DLC but I do have some questions.  


1. What exactly is the new stuff that is getting added? The end game currently, as a primarily solo player, of the base game is pretty lackluster. Just kind of looking for new stuff to do. I enjoy PvP, so on that note.
2. Is PvP normalized between people who don't have the expansion and those that do? I've noticed that most of the people in conflicts with me are level 40. Does everyone's gear get normalized? I had always wondered how much of a disadvantage I was at.
3. Is the Dark zone split up between those with the expansion and those without? I've never seen a level 40 player in any of my dark zones so I assumed this to be true. If so how populous are the dark zones in WoNY. I find that a lot of the time my dark zone feels extremely empty and is unenjoyable because of that.
4. Does the world difficulty get harder? As it currently stands in WT5 I feel little to no challenge. I've seen a ton of youtube videos where people complain about the difficulty, but on my end in WT5 it felt fairly easy, with the exception of lvl 4CPs and the frustration of dying in a heroic mission towards the end. I would imagine that getting gear at level 40 which is often times 4-5x stronger than gear at 515, the world MUST scale.
5. If the world scales how does that impact my friends that will not be getting the expansion? If I join their world will it just be a stomp? How does the game balance itself for a mixed DLC and non DLC group?
6. Are the bugs more rampant in WoNY than in base game? I've seen countless posts about various bugs, but on my end I haven't really seen a lot of these ""game-breaking"" bugs.

fodt5j,Alb4tr0s,I'm angry and need to vent about the game.,"Hello fellow agents.  TLDR at the further down.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I normally try to keep my piece untill I get better or improve my build. This time around I couldn't hold myself but to think after the last week I've never felt this much frustrated playing a game in my life. Not even this much even when 1.3 in The Division 1 was released. Did anyone at massive has gotten an encounter of rogues and won a fight during polarity switch with the current HP, DPS and Armor scalling? I really really really really really... REALLY think that the answer is NO.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If so, please I would like a video proof of them playing it and wining the rogue encounter, or the names of the guys that playtested this before the released it, so I just feel stupid and keep my mouth shut.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I know tomorrow they will deploy a different scalling during the maintenance and change some good things, but HOLY MOTHER OF BRUCE WILLIS. Let me vent adn detail the events of the last 5 hours.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This happened in 3 different ocassions on 3 different missions, 2 on Challenging and 1 in Heroic. NON STOP and exactly the same. THIS IS NOT ENJOYABLE.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*On challenging:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Blind firing shotgun 1-tapped from 70 feet and have to deal with 2 defender drones, 2 or 3 assault drones chewing you so fast, 2 mortar turrets shooting non-stop, foam launchers in an absurd amount, hive stingers with the bleed that ticks for 450k+ health every nanosecond, healing hives that tick the NPC Rogues for and upto 2 armor bars at a time, grenade SPAM, for the love of god, 4 agents throwing non-stop grenades through a door way that only can take so many grenades. OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again. We as agents have 7 grenades and they get 600 of them.

&amp;#x200B;

And above all of that, you can't even shoot one of them that a different polarity npc will get infront of him at the speed of light. Shocked again. and Shocked-1tapped shotty. And again. Move to cover, res a friend- grenades. And then they push you while you are lighting up his face with an LMG wihtout flinching elbows you from NYC to DC so fast you arrive at DC with diapers, a pacifier and  your mother rocking you on a crib.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*On Heroic:\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

What you read onm challenging and multiply that x5. ABSURD.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

RINSE REPEAT EVERY ENCOUNTER. NON STOP. This is agravatting, frustrating and not enjoyable. (at least I speak for myself)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

/rant.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: If you encounter a rogue squad in any mission or difficulty with the polarity active, just wipe and try to finish the mission without losing brain cells in the procces.

You keep working at it and I'll keep paying you. Do I care about the bugs and breaks, yes. Keep working on them and I'll keep paying you and playing.

I don't care that I have to PLAY MORE DIVISION to get an EXOTIC that I want. I also don't care that I have to PLAY MORE DIVISION to get a second one with better rolls.

I don't care that I have to craft the same weapon 100 times to get a god roll, because I have to PLAY MORE DIVISION to grind mats.

I don't care that Challenging mode can be challenging, I actually like it. I also don't like that I can solo a Heroic with a decent build and patience, because that's not the Division we first wavers fell in love with, so I'm glad that's being worked on.

fod4p0,ThePersianRaptor,Transitioning from Doom Eternal back to Division 2...Some build adjustments needed to be made...,"[""Rip and tear until it is done!""](https://streamable.com/8yqbr)

I wanted a PvE build that had a similar tempo (stretching a little bit but...yeah lol), but didn't have me running scared for my life at the damage output of enemy NPCs (I know, it's being adjusted tomorrow). So I tinker'd around from my stash and came up with a skirmisher build featuring the Lady Death exotic. A little tanky, a great amount of damage, and a little extra momentum from the speed buff, and a fun build came out of it. 

Until the damage adjustments tomorrow go through, It's currently not meant for 4 man scale challenging and above, but its a good solo/2 man scale build. You can get away with 4 man scale by using a HE SMG instead of Lady Death, but it's not as silly fun. If you wanna try and build it for yourself, the key pieces are:

* Lady Death/Any preference of a HE SMG
* The Contractor's Gloves (Petrov) and Forge (R&amp;K) named items. These named items aren't necessarily required, but they increase your damage and shield tankiness significantly. Just swap both out for a set bonus piece of choice if you don't have them.
* Intimidate and Bloodsucker on the chest piece and backpack respectively.
* Any gear variation of 3 skill tier cores and 3 weapon damage cores featuring the named items listed above, 1 Solokov,1 Grupo Sombra, 1 Hana-U (can be traded out for something else, I just wanted more utility from skill haste), 1 Ceska. All red attributes recommended, just as long as the core attributes are 3 skill tier/3 weapon damage.

* For skills: Crusader shield or Striker shield (I'm a bigger fan of the Gunner spec), and Banshee Pulse/Decoy for Crowd Control.",3,1585083773,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fod4p0/transitioning_from_doom_eternal_back_to_division/,thedivision,1

focque,Neon_Red_Nights,BUG: Bleed damage caused by Special Ammo Directive True Sons/Rikers is possibly bugged and stacking in damage.,"Was testing status effect related stuff today with my shield using Special Ammo Directive since it gives each faction a specific special ammo type to test against; when I went to test bleed vs True Sons/Rikers I was ANNIHILATED through my shield by bleed damage. I tested the special ammo burn caused by Cleaners/Outcasts to check their damage and let the special ammo users just wail on my shield and the burn damage was totally fine on my character's armor.

For the Rikers I also tested being hit by the bleed caused by the nailbomb and heavy's nailgun, both were totally normal in damage.

I think what's happening is each bullet from the special ammo carrier is stacking the bleed damage repeatedly because I also ran into and tested vs one that was using a shotgun, and the damage didn't spiral out of control because of the slower firerate on a shotgun. It also makes sense because when I was testing the Riker bleed in the Wall Street mission, one jumped onto that mini-gun at the start and I RAPIDLY started taking massive amounts of bleed after the shield took multiple hits from it.

I tested this in Heroic missions and Heroic Light Zone with Special Ammo Directive on; if people could double check this too and report back their findings that'd be helpful. Shield was a good way to test because the status damage will not hurt the shield and goes straight to character armor/health allowing for more controlled testing.",2,1585082510,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/focque/bug_bleed_damage_caused_by_special_ammo_directive/,thedivision,1

Look at your metrics and see if the player based increased during the time in which the “glitch” set was in the game.  And now that the “glitch” set has been removed, what do your metrics tell you? If they say what I think they say (that the player based loved feeling powerful) then maybe the glitch could return as a four piece gear set, moderately more difficult to attain, however once attained gives the division agent all the power we need to smash multiple yellow bars in less than a single clip.  

The set would only work on PVE, and if you feel like the set makes you too powerful while navigating your personal PVE experience then take it off, run something else, play how you like. But give the player base something that makes us feel like the grind is worth it. Give us something that after hundreds of hours of grinding content, we feel powerful, Godly!!

I don’t know about everyone else but if I grind this game for so many hours, I want to eventually be the most powerful entity on the map.  Massive give us the God mode set!

foc2me,CrazySeb16,BUG: Missing Dodge City Gunslinger's Holster exotic part,"Need Help!

Details and screenshots here:  [https://imgur.com/a/WI8plAB](https://imgur.com/a/WI8plAB) 

I had previously completed the project and crafted the holster at level 30. I am now doing it again at level 40 in TU8. The only remaining exotic part I need at this point is the ORNATE LEATHER HOLSTER, that drops from a level 4 Hyena CP.

The bug is that no matter how many level 4 Hyena CP I do, or any other faction CP, either I get no exotic part at all or I get a duplicate of the FAST LEATHER BELT that we get from the first CP on the West side of the map. So it goes like this:

\-Hyena CP = Sometimes nothing, sometimes a BELT duplicate (at the moment it is 50/50)

\-Outcast, True Sons or Cleaner CP = Nothing

We can see in this picture that I already have the BELT and everything else, but still this is the only thing that drops from Hyena CP.

The ORNATE LEATHER HOLSTER just won't drop. I'm stuck and can't get the holster.

Am I missing something here? Did anybody encounter a similar situation? Any possible solution?

foby9p,WhiteWulph,When did this game come out? I bought this last week and used the boost (mainly cause I am a vet of TD1 so wanted to jump in.... why am I asking... the amount of bugs and lack of apparel customisations. **ALSO SPOILERS**,"So I’m into season ranks now and although that last boss fight on the warlords of New York was rock solid to complete.... until we all realised we needed to equipment ourselves with EMP Pulse. I seemed to of flown through the game’s campaign (separate character for DC Campaign) even on normal. But now all of a sudden the most basic AI enemies are stripping me of my armour within seconds... I died at least 5 times trying to get to cover at a control point, until I sat at the end of the boundary with a turret, Chem repair and my trusty sniper. 

Wtf is going on? Also what’s with:
1. Enemies not loading in but able to down me.
2. Audio not being in sync so I’ll be firing away and my enemies have no audio whatsoever. 
3. Enemies spawning within buildings that have no entrances so unable to complete activities.
4. Enemies that run away from the activity so I have to chase them a few blocks away from the activity, resulting in abandoned activities sometimes.
5. Random deaths... for example I completed a mission and was about to access a laptop and my heath, not shield went down to zero and I died instantly. 
6. Invincible black tusk mini gunners.
7. Bad mission markers. 

Also what’s with the apparel keys? Have we seriously been entered into a pay for clothing gear loot box issue? What happened to finding or buying clothes with in game currency? And the amount of stuff we had in TD1 why did they not import them into the game? The raincoats where good and there was so much variety. Feel like they’ve released a broken game because they had no money and are relying on us to purchase content that should be free to pay devs to fix and create what they should have already fixed and created.

fo9ul9,desertedgoat,Dark Souls or Division 2?,"I'm curious if the whole point of turning Ghost Recon: Wildlands into a terrible half-baked shooter looter was to also change the Division 2 into Dark Souls? Massive, you do realize you are making a shooter looter (where the point of the mode is to grind content for loot not spend 5 hours doing one activity) correct? Hmm this game needs content, I know what to do, let's add a mode only 5% of the community will be able to complete and a weapon (it's not very good right now but wait until they buff it) from that mode specifically that isn't even a guaranteed item so you have to grind this ridiculous mode for it. Worried about damage glitches but people are still getting one tapped by the M1A without it. Then the damage glitch gets fixed and with everyone complaining about scaling and sponginess of enemies your take away isn't the fact that players were saying the dps glitch made the game more bearable, it was ""lets buff the scaling and tankiness of enemies in heroic"" so it's back to Agents firearms being BB guns. Finally you people at Massive need to actually play and test your game, buggiest game I own and I own Sellout 76 and for the experience of the ridiculous missions you have created, Black Tusk just spamming 1000 drones and noob tubes at you at the same time as a dog spin to win one shotting everything. That's not difficulty, that's just drug fiend lazy mission design (It's like someone's kid made the missions and before they started plotting npc enemies they ate enough sugar to instantly give you diabetes and also huffed a bunch of paint, possibly 200 cups of coffee as well). The main issue with doing this type of difficulty is there is no skill gap expect aim in a game like this, build is what matters and nobody wants to build because the grind for any good loot is still ridiculous, you either deal with super tank npcs (which on a side not less people would be activily trying to find dps, etc. glitches if you fixed this) or get one shotted to the body by an M1A in the Dark Zone not to mention pepega defender done/shield spam still in the game. Revive hive glitched again/still glitched, re-pawns are still glitched and you can only res with a revive hive, day one console players still seem to get a dps reduction when compared to PC (copy Widdz exact build for LMG and you can't get the dps he gets with you getting all headshots), etc. (literally like we are back to day 1 Division 2).

Now everyone can see why the game only cost $3.00. I love this game but holy cow people can only take so much trash, and once again fix the freaking PvP, that is the end game, not the raid, not legendaries it's PvP and the PvP (especially conflict) is still brokenly bad. Thanks for reading the rant, and let's hope Massive get's their poop together. Finally I know supporters of this game will be like ""it's only been a couple of weeks, give them time"" no, this has been things plaguing the game since day 1 and they just keep repeating the process. Also sorry for run on sentences/grammar, I feel like being like Massive and too lazy to check/edit my work.",2,1585073278,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo9ul9/dark_souls_or_division_2/,thedivision,1

fo9rws,BLCKART,Bullet Sponges - A good solution for both sides,"Hey Agents,

as we all have seen the discussion going here regarding the bulletsponginess of enemies in TU8. Many say its too spongy - many others seem to like it.

I tried heroic content, missions &amp; cps - I completed them all. But it wasn’t fun - at least for me - and many others here. Since you‘re fighting bulletsponges. Even with a nicely optimized full red build you need like 2 Mags to kill them - and they run around like U.Bolt on steroids while having a deadly tourette seizure...and then 3 of them decide to rush you at once from 100m away - walking around your cover hitting with 100% acc - It‘s cheesy and frustrating. Many will agree - many wont - and thats why I‘m posting this.

I think this community is devided regarding the bulletsponge topic. And here‘s why:

A big part comes from shooters like Ghost Recon (they like the faster TTK) - the other big part comes from MMO‘s where sponge enemies are common (and compared to the division, actually make sense - if you fight a dragon with a sword or shoot at some large armored aliens)

I think the devs should cater to their different customer groups playing this game instead of going further and trying to find a mediocre middleground solution.

An easy fix would be to let the damage output of the enemies as it is - but reduce the TTK drastically - then call it - 

- „Heroic - Hardcore“ 
and 
„Legendary - Hardcore“ 

add these difficulties to the ones we have now.

It would look like this:

Story
Normal
Hard
Challenging
Heroic
Heroic - Hardcore
Legendary
Legendary - Hardcore

So people who like bullet sponges can play the version as it is now (with reduced npc damage - as coming with the patch) and others can enjoy another flavour of the high difficulties - and also get good loot. (If RNG allows it)

Some may say that would make farming good gear to easy and fast. I dont think so.
We know the RNG in this game - drops are shit 99% of the time - even on the highest difficulties.

When your library is filled - it would still take ages to get a optimized build with only god rolled stats - especially on exotics. Nobody would be harmed.

fo9peh,PaulOaktree,"NYC Named items drop is terrible (and/or is bugged)! (""Devil's Due"" farming)","I've been grinding NYC open world, prety much every time there's Ceska as target loot on.

I've done hundreds of activities, and I actually got around 15 named drops, BUT, only ONE of those drops was the named Ceska backpack, with Perfect Clutch! 1 in 15 (or more then 15)!

In WDC, if I go to Providence area, when I get a named item, it's usually ""The Sacrifice"", if I go to an LMG area, it's usually a named... LMG! (9 in 10, I believe), and so on.

But farming for the ""Devil's Due"" has been one of the most disapointing things I have ever done in TD.

So, this drop rate is either intended, and it's stupid as fuck! 
Or, there's some kind of bug with the drops.

Now, my issue is not that I don't have named items drop, my issue is that they mostly drop items that are not from the target loot in that area.

How are the named items drop rate for you all? Noticed anything like this, farming for a piece, and getting a lot more drops from diferent items, then the one on target loot?",2,1585072848,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo9peh/nyc_named_items_drop_is_terrible_andor_is_bugged/,thedivision,1

I'm not here to bitch about the game or anything. I actually really like the game but..... The shit gets old after a while. Constantly getting nothing but trash and no exotic drops. For context I normally play solo on challenging difficulty. 

The glitch gave me a chance to farm heroics and legendaries with ease. Granted I still had shit drops but after farming checkpoints, bounties, and missions for about 25 hours total I have this to show for it.

98% was garbage
Zero exotic drops
Zero god roll pieces of gear
16 pieces of gear that had one max stat


Even with my God awful luck the game actually felt rewarding while using the glitch. Instead of doing a 30 min run of (insert challenging missing here) and getting garbage at the end. It now only took 6 mins. Garbage at the end was the same but atleast you didn't spend 30 mins doing it.

I could be wrong, but it seems like a good idea to save that stuff for my specializations, to streamline them, right? It's alot of EXP tied into easy activities. I just worry that the map could change so much that I'll miss content, or worse, things like gear, attachments, and blueprints. 

ALSO, importantly, I would like to know what I should be paying attention to before hitting NYC. I think I've only maxed like one or two projects, I haven't touched the workbench, nor have I talked to anyone at settlements save the people you recruit.

fo7e2p,iThots,"Massive, your build system is not deep enough."," If I can leave the game for 5 months, come back and still have  a build on par with people who never left, your build system is not deep enough. Staying in the game gives me no benefit, grinding for a perfectly rolled build is not worth it when a good enough build can achieve the same results. 

You have a game  with 5 difficulty levels and 4 of them are completely pointless. Your idea of doing normal to get gear for hard and do hard to get gear for challenging is exactly what needed to be. But the execution was poorly because all the gear are the same level. The best gear can be found in normal and jump straight to heroic, the gap between bad gear and good gear is not that big and even bad gear with a patient can do difficult content. 

With a good execution of this, even the most hardcore of players should still be stuck between hard and challenging not even dreaming of doing Legendaries yet. Lvl 40 gear should have been tiered. Normal should have given lvl 40 tier 1 gear and only a min maxed and optimized lvl 40 tier 1 build should be able to handle Hard difficulty, which would then give lvl 40 tier 2 gear. The greatest tier 1 build should be worse than the worse tier 2. And it keeps going on until you gain tier 5 gear on Heroic so you can handle a Legendary. And when I say only min maxed and optimized builds should handle the next difficulty I really mean it to the fullest extent. This prevents half assed tier 1 builds rushing to tier 2 and never putting any care to their tier one gear or caring at all about tier 1 loot, the same way we plow through lvl 31 -39 gear until we reach lvl 40 and only then start to care about the loot.

This gives me incentive to grind and not want to quit the game. This makes the small content in the game last for a long time without feeling boring or pointless because you are always progressing and upgrading your build. The tiers should also have unique stuff and something other than just higher numbers to have a reason for a min maxed tier 1 to want to jump to tier 2. 

The difference betwen a tier 1 build and a tier 5 build should be like the difference between a world tier 1 build and world tier 5 build. And I know that was probably what you had in mind when you made the world tiers. But the different tiers being in separate worlds where each had the 4 difficulties that were basically meaningless is what made it not work. People dont like being seprated by world and feel like they need to rush to the final one. But if you make it on the same world and base it on difficulty it might work. Right now I would consider my build a tier 3 and I can comfortably do Heroics. If I come back in 5 months the difference between this build and a full god rolled build would be negligible. And that makes me think: Why bother trying to make  god rolled build at all?",2,1585065189,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo7e2p/massive_your_build_system_is_not_deep_enough/,thedivision,1
fo7dus,EclipseGeckos,For anyone wanting some tank build ideas,"Personally all I run in this game are tank builds. Thought I might as well share some since I've had a few players I've matched with ask for them.

Pistol DPS Tank: 
This is one of my newer tank builds and is actually pretty fun to play. All current gear I own is nearly triple god roll so also take that into factor.

Total Stats
Armor - 2,016,020 |
Crit Chance -  60% |
Crit Damage - 112% |

Gear Breakdown: 
1 D&amp;H Mask - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg, red mod. Extra 20% pistol damage

1 Grupo Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 15% crit dmg

1 Ceska Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance crit dmg. Extra 10% crit chance

2 Badger preferably Chest &amp; Back for red mod - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 5% Armor

1 Gila Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 5% Armor

Talents Breakdown: 
Chest - Vanguard for 20s your entire team has an extra 900k bonus armor, 25s cooldown so for 5s there's no bonus armor this can be worked around with the second talent

Backpack - Protector for constant bonus armor to team. While your shield is being hit your team gains 15% of your armor as bonus armor with a 3s cooldown. So long as you're getting shot, your team will always have this buff up.

As for my pistol I either use the exotic Liberty for the extra shield survivability, or a 1911 with preservation for self healing.



Second Build - Tanky Medic
Total Stats:
Armor 2,100,021 |
Repair skill 177% (could be 180 but my repair mods are only 19% atm) |

Gear Breakdown:

3 Golan Mask/Chest/Backpack - Max Armor, max repair skill, 3 utility mod slots. Extra 5% Armor

2 Badger Hands/Holster/Knee - Max Armor, max repair skill. Extra 5% Armor

1 Gila Hands/Holster/Knee - Max Armor, max repair skill. Extra 5% Armor

Talents Breakdown:
Chest - Protector for constant bonus armor to team. While your shield is being hit your team gains 15% of your armor as bonus armor with a 3s cooldown. So long as you're getting shot, your team will always have this buff up.

Backpack - Safeguard if your shield gets hit it doesn't count as direct damage towards you. Taking advantage of this allows you to use the 100% bonus towards repair skill percentage.

With this build your chem launcher surpasses over a 500k heal (without a single skill tier) even more so while safeguard is active. As well as giving 4 shots which every 30s, even faster if you opt to get skill haste as your 3rd stat on gear. As well as constantly being able to provide your team with a nice and hefty 950k over shield every 25s.",10,1585065166,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo7dus/for_anyone_wanting_some_tank_build_ideas/,thedivision,1
fo799w,-other-barry,"Can some one explain ""diminishing returns""","Hey guys and gals hope every one is being safe . I have a question about diminishing returns regarding how some states work . So before the update my skill build would basically have seconds on my cool down because of all the skill cool down mods and what note i had . It didn't seem like there was any kind of cap on how quick you could get your skills back . Now since playing I've gotten new gear and some really good skill haste with my armor . I'm currently sitting at 107. Skill haste but I've noticed if I add any more skill haste my skills dont reduce in speed . Why is that? Is there a cap on how quickly skills can come back . Like for instance my sticky bomb is on a 14sec cool down how ever my cluster mines are on 24 sec. Before I had them down to 9 seconds .  

Im just curious at what point you'd want to stop investing in cool down and start investing in other things.  So yeah if some one is able to explain how this stuff works I've always been curious I've always heard the term but never truly understood what it ment .

fo6q8a,Drunk_General,What happened to this game - Is this still The Division?,"What happened to that game we were all presented at E3?

This hard core, open world, survival, cover based, shooter, with resource gathering, crafting, tech upgrade and build diversity.

Even though we have a lot more to do than in The Division 1, The Division 2 just feels like such a downgrade, empty and not rewarding...

1: The Gear Sets hardly work and the ones that are working are reduced to 2-3 sets.  
\-Have anyone seen other than Hard Wired, True Patriot and occasionally Striker, in PvE the last half year? What about the rest of the Gear Sets?  
Build diversity just feels so underwhelming!

2: And talking about build diversity. Why is health and armour so insignificant?  
It doesn't matter if you have 6 million or 6 thousand armour. You get one-shot by every NPC in the game. I know this is exaggerated, but this leaves every single player in open world Match Making to either equip a crit chance build or a skill build. If you are lucky, a healer or True Patriot. Some times the shield / rifle combo... until that get's nerfed. God forbid people have fun in this game.

3: And why are the Exotics so underwhelming? I get more excited when I see a P416 or a CTAR than any of the exotics. And when the exotics drop, even on Heroic or Legendary you can still get absolute crap rolls. This feels empty and not rewarding!

4: The level scaling (i know it's being balanced now) also feels so punishing. And I don't mean that as a challenge, but as a punishment. It's not fun to do solo and it's not fun to do in groups. It just takes too long, it's not hard, it's just too bullet spongy, emptying magazine after magazine. Just like it was early in The Division 1 and when you launched The Division 2. Why haven't Massive learned this lesson the third time?

5: And Finally the endgame... Why has it become so Arcade?  
The Seasons are such a downer...  
Manhunt: Clear the same Control Points, but in a dictated order.  
Leagues: A game mode where you run exactly the same content... but on time.  
People hated it so much that almost every player and their grandmother exploited the DMG glitch to get that painful experience over with.  
Polarity: A game mode where you run exactly the same content... but this time you are not allowed to be color blind. What does a flashing right arm and it changing color has to do with saving a post pandemic Washington!?!?!?!  
...and Legendary Missions: I dare everyone in here to join a Legendary Mission and make it clear to the rest of the team that you are not intending to use an exploit. They will kick you. Happened to mere several times the last couple of weeks.  


That's my rant. I'm disappointed. A little sad. The Division feels like it has gone full arcade shooter and have lost the last respect it had for the Tom Clancy franchise.  


Will this seriously get better? I doubt it...

fo6199,badger_sr,All these glitches... Massive needs to revert back to before WONY.,"This is just ridiculous now. The incompetence of the devs is just completely unacceptable. Massive, this is why you do a PTS for major updates. This is why you have a quality in-house testing department. This is why you should fire a lot of people at your company and hire people who actually know what they are doing. The state of this game, after over a whole year, is a complete shambles. The DPS glitch has been attempted to be fixed twice, and within an hour, people have found a way to do it again. After this next round of DPS glitch bullshit, people have found a way to transfer talents onto any gun. Yes that is right. You can stack as many talents as you want. Onto one gun. You can have a FAMAS, with the bulletking talent, the pestilence talent, the merciless talent, every other high end talent all at once. So... a FAMAS with infinite ammo as long as you hit target, that procs explosions, that stacks D.O.T with millions of DPS and spreads it.. along with every other high end talent. This is just stupid.

fo5ugt,drazilking,Massive : I Don't want to leave the game behind again,"Hello Massive ,

Division 2 was released and we were all over whelmed with the quality of the game. How much content it had however honeymoon period didn't went long. The issues existed on the game back then was really problematic and many of us including me leave the game behind and move to other games.

After following the development of the game from distance , i returned back 2 weeks before the last expansion. The game was in a good state , i could run different builds and have fun back again.

Expansion hit , content is again well designed. You found good mechanics to keep casual , semi-casual and hardcore players invested in the game. The expansion was well designed , story line is a good improvement. New york and missions are very well designed. 

But there are really important issues that hinders the game play experience. I like to deal with challenging activities but just to by pass the horrible scaling in the missions , i don't want to be forced dealing time trials solo. I know there are great players whom have perfect builds and can do anything they want. However i don't have enough time to farm legendary missions over and over again. I have a good build , can easily handle myself on heroic missions but :

1. Game doesn't allow me to improve my builds because loot even on heroic are usually not well designed.
2. Enemies are extremely bullet sponge and scaling is very badly designed
3. Game must always contain fun element. Yes , challenge is nice but there is nothing fun on getting hit by a grenade and die instantly because of burn damage. 
4. Enemy ability spamming is at absurd levels. Yes they have shorter cool downs but shorter shouldn't mean instant grenade , drone spamming. 
5. There are some missions which final boss have small fight area , the amount of enemy you have to deal with becomes absurd when you add status effects , ability spamming mentioned above.
6. Please include more Legendary missions where we can challenge ourselves when desired.
7. Please add a drop chance increase mechanism to Exotics. If you want challenge means something , add only drop chance increase to heroic version. But doing countless runs and not receiving BK is painful when i can only find some time to play daily. Please don't forget that Gaming is a hobby 
8. There are so many bugs in the game like revive bug , enemies being stuck in places ,etc.. needs to be priotorised to be fixed. Yesterday i was doing Heroic Wall Street and the just after cleaning the APC , the bus was stuck Nothing corrected it and the time we invested in the game is gone. I closed the game after this.
9. Please try to balance the game on PC vs Console separately. This desire is not only for Enemy scaling but for activity completion times/targets. The game feels very different on PC with little to no recoil. They can have constant head shots where it is not that easy when you use controller. 
10. Please add matchmaking for Raid. I really have no desire to go on third party websites to find a group to raid. I don't mind trying multiple times but if communication is key , please force Microphone usage on matchmaking. You have this great content there but there is nearly no easy way to attend this activity. I have over 250 raids on Destiny 2 and at least 150 on Destiny 1 but on Division i have 0 raid clears. 
11. Seeing a very rare exotic drop is nice however seeing the drop having bad stats take all the joy away. Either increase drop rates or at least define a 50% min stat criteria that can at least will not turn the drop into a complete junk. 
12. We have a useless currency as Textiles. Duplicate items turning into Textiles which can't be used any where at all. Please don't try to mimic Bungie on eververse , what they did turned down a lot of players. Try not making the same mistake please.

The game is just on the edge of being in a perfect state. I am going to try to endure at least one more month to wait see what type of improvements Massive is going to focus on. 

The list may look a lot and some may disagree with me. These are opinions from a 40+ year old gamer who has been gaming for 25+ years casually. 

Before hanging up this long essay let me also state some positive improvements i see with the last expansion. 

Store line is picking up nicely and finally Massive found a way to wonder about future expansions. Great improvement.

Man hunts , i really like them and i wish they were introduced every 2 weeks. 

Watch is very similar to Diablo paragon level. Keeps me very interested with the game. 

League's shall have an option to create 2 man matchmaking. Other then that good improvement to create different focus area's. 

Visually game gets better and better every expansion , great job.

So if you basically try to dedicate your focus on a Quality of Life focused update , the game can become extremely well and gather many Destiny deserters. 

If it is going to take longer to develop all these , just inform us with a road map planning . I am sure many players like me will patiently wait this game to become great.

And one final request Please learn from your mistakes and try Not to repeat them.",9,1585059492,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo5ugt/massive_i_dont_want_to_leave_the_game_behind_again/,thedivision,1

Half the time it doesn't work for me, seems to be bugged too).

I tend to be rather relaxed when gaming, but TD2 is becoming more and more frustrating, even borderline rage inducing lately. And why? Cause you guys can't get the difficulty scaling right and come up with excuses, thinking that everybody enjoys shooting at aimbot bulletsponges carrying railguns.

Pistol DPS Tank: 
This is one of my newer tank builds and is actually pretty fun to play. All current gear I own is nearly triple god roll so also take that into factor.

Total Stats
Armor - 2,016,020
Crit Chance -  60%
Crit Damage - 112%

Gear Breakdown: 
1 D&amp;H Mask - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg, red mod. Extra 20% pistol damage

1 Grupo Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 15% crit dmg

1 Ceska Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance crit dmg. Extra 10% crit chance

2 Badger preferably Chest &amp; Back for red mod - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 5% Armor

1 Gila Hands/Holster/Knee - Max armor, crit chance, crit dmg. Extra 5% Armor

Talents Breakdown: 
Chest - Vanguard for 20s your entire team has an extra 900k bonus armor, 25s cooldown so for 5s there's no bonus armor this can be worked around with the second talent

Backpack - Protector for constant bonus armor to team. While your shield is being hit your team gains 15% of your armor as bonus armor with a 3s cooldown. So long as you're getting shot, your team will always have this buff up.

As for my pistol I either use the exotic Liberty for the extra shield survivability, or a 1911 with preservation for self healing.



Second Build - Tanky Medic
Total Stats:
Armor 2,100,021
Repair skill 177% (could be 180 but my repair mods are only 19% atm)

Gear Breakdown

3 Golan Mask/Chest/Backpack - Max Armor, max repair skill, 3 utility mod slots. Extra 5% Armor

2 Badger Hands/Holster/Knee - Max Armor, max repair skill. Extra 5% Armor

1 Gila Hands/Holster/Knee - Max Armor, max repair skill. Extra 5% Armor

Talents Breakdown:
Chest - Protector for constant bonus armor to team. While your shield is being hit your team gains 15% of your armor as bonus armor with a 3s cooldown. So long as you're getting shot, your team will always have this buff up.

Backpack - Safeguard if your shield gets hit it doesn't count as direct damage towards you. Taking advantage of this allows you to use the 100% bonus towards repair skill percentage.

With this build your chem launcher surpasses over a 600k heal even more so while safeguard is active. As well as giving 4 shots which every 30s, even faster if you opt to get skill haste as your 3rd stat on gear. As well as constantly being able to provide your team with a nice and hefty 950k over shield every 25s.",0,1585058073,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo5hbz/my_personal_tank_builds/,thedivision,1

Even the last clutch meta and 3-11-7 meta, armor builds eventually rose to the top. (3-11-7 giving you high armor plus everything else).

Now armor means nothing, and the TTK is gone sky high. Rifle builds are the meta and are really pushing out other build types. 

Devs have addressed this and stated that the TTK is too high. 

I’ll keep playing PvE for now. But does anyone think that PvP in Div2 will ever get interesting?

I switched global difficulty a few times. Usually from Hard to Heroic. But there was also a Nomal and Challenging in there. And then after about half an hour a little red gun appeared and the True sons took back a control point. 

I just left it and nothing else happened for days despite switching difficulties again a few times. And then a new invasion started and after a day the Hyena's got the balls up to take an additional control point. 

Since then another three control points have fallen and one has changed hands.

I'm just leaving them to fall now until the map is properly red.

fo4tw0,reallyfatsparrow,"Finished, confused by what to do","Last night I finished off the Warlords story arc.

I hit 40 a few days ago, and cleared out all the side missions I could find I think, reviewed the new mission stuff, but I'm still confused.

What am I actually supposed to be doing? The game talked up seasons and leagues and stuff, but the 'explanations' didn't make much sense, especially since something already closed and I couldn't claim any rewards from it.

I'm also very confused on how to finish leveling up my grenade launcher specialization - I'm at 65 points or something. Or how to level the other ones as well.

If it helps, I played Division 1 and 2 at launch, but stopped shortly after finishing the core.",7,1585055339,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo4tw0/finished_confused_by_what_to_do/,thedivision,1

fo4knv,FL1NTZ,Massive: Please Consider Adding Another Attribute On Gear Sets,"Hey Massive!

I know you guys are busying with trying to fix the game, so I understand if this request gets parked until the time is right.  Is there any way you could consider adding another attribute gear sets at all? I feel like they get overlooked because of high end brand sets having that extra stat.

I would love to use some of the new gear sets because they do have very cool talents. Unfortunately, I overlook them because brand sets are just more powerful over all, plain and simple.  In my opinion, gear sets should be at parity with the formatting of high end brand sets.  I would LOVE to incorporate a lot of the brand set bonuses into my builds, but they seriously suffer big time with not having that extra stat.  From what I recall, The Division 1 gear sets were the same as high ends, so I don't quite understand what the issue is here.

I know sometimes you make decisions in the name of balance and I understand that fully. But I feel as though you are ""playing it too safe"" with gear sets. Add the extra attribute in there and see how creative players are when making builds.  In this case, throw the gloves off and let's see what happens!  Please take this into consideration when you have a moment.

Thanks!",21,1585054238,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo4knv/massive_please_consider_adding_another_attribute/,thedivision,1

I get that, but that is also self destructive for the game. Eventually, you will lose the ability to get new players because they will never be able to catch up.

Casual players will also drop.

Instead, maybe accelerate the rate to getting build completion and make the DZ about actual skill instead of how much time someone spent farming over and over again.

The DPS glitch was so much fun in PVE... but that’s because it gave a lot of us the ability to play harder difficulty missions (and the only reason to do that is for the increased drop rates).

But it’s still the equivalent of “I spent more time doing the glitch than you so I deserve to run harder content or kill you faster I’m PVP”.

The system reminds me of Diablo 3s paragon system which was useful to boosts the players core stats passively, however the big difference between the two was that the paragon system could be upgraded infinitely while the SHD system caps at 50 points in each category. My suggestion either increase or remove the cap on 1 of each of the 4 combat based categories, like weapon damage for offensive, max armor for defensive, skill damage for ultility, and Max ammo for weapon handling.

TL;DR:  Remove or increase SHD watch cap for weapon\skill damage, total armor, and Max ammo.",3,1585051041,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo3wm5/small_improvement_to_shd_watch_system_that_could/,thedivision,1

We are still evaluating several changes that are coming in on the server side and will update this post to reflect any changes.  


**Gameplay changes**  


* Seasonal Manhunt is changed to allow progress at Normal difficulty and above. This will make playing together easier as all players will gain progress no matter what difficulty was set by the group leader.
* Seasonal Manhunt is receiving a button in the Manhunt UI that allows players to reset the Manhunt to replay it. This allows players to reset the progress specifically and without changing the Global Difficulty.
* This also means changing the Global Difficulty will not reset the Seasonal Manhunt and players are required to reset it via the Seasonal Manhunt UI.
* Coyote’s Mask will drop from Coyote with an increased drop chance on higher difficulties.
* We are also looking into providing the Mask for players that have not received them even though they reached Season Rank 35.
* Increasing the reward quality for the following Open World Activities to be in line with other activities: Public Execution, Settlement Blockade and Propaganda Broadcast.
* Reward caches from Conflict matches at maximum level are now of High-End quality.

**Balancing changes:**  


**Developer Note:**  
The game was tuned in a way that playing the exact same enemy composition at higher difficulties and higher player counts would match to the expected gear of that difficulty and extra players added. However, since the game also adds more Elites and Veterans to accommodate higher difficulty and player counts, this caused tuning to overcompensate health and damage higher than intended.  We are thus lowering many of these values.  


* Reduce NPC Damage output for all difficulties.
* This applies to all NPCs and activities and enemies will do less damage to players compared to their current damage output.
* Reduce NPC Health and Amor for group scaling.
* Enemy Health and Armor scaling for 2-, 3- and 4-player groups based on Veterancy.
* This means Red, Veteran, Elite and Named enemies will have their Health and Armor reduced compared to their current values.
* Additionally, we are adjusting Health and Armor based on activity difficulty.
* This applies to Hard and Challenging difficulties where enemies will have lower Health and Armor compared to their current values.
* An exception are Heroic and Legendary difficulty enemies which will have their Health and Armor increased to compensate for the group scaling reductions to their values.

**Developer Note:** We still intend Heroic and Legendary to be very challenging. Therefore, we are increasing the base difficulty to account for the health reductions for co-op scaling. Compared to now this means Heroic and Legendary will be a bit harder for solo players and 2-player groups, 3-player difficulty will stay roughly the same, and 4-player difficulty will be easier.  


* Black Tusk specific adjustments which went live earlier last week
* Reduced the health of Warhounds.
* Reduced damage of Warhound Sniper.
* Reduced the damage of the 360 spin of Warhound minigun.
* Increased the intention icon duration of the 360 spin from Warhound Minigun to give players more time to react.
* Reduced weak point health of Warhound Grenadier’s Control Unit.
* Support Station
* Reduced Base Health of Support Station.
* Adjusted health scaling of Support Station with Veterancies.
* Increased likelihood of Support Stations being deployed in the open (away from cover).
* EMP effects will now damage the Support Station.

Lvl 30 WT1-WT5 Content  


* NPC Damage, Health and Armor will receive additional reductions.

**Developer Note:** Pre-Warlords of New York content has lower maximum values to weapon damage, skill damage, and armor (etc.) than level 31+ content so difficulty is now tuned separately for pre-expansion world tier content.  


PvP Balance Changes:  


* All PvP weapon damage: - 20%
* PvP Rifles: an additional -10%
* PvP MMRs: an additional -10%

Skills  


* Cluster Seeker Mine:
* Reduced distance to bull charge from 12m to 10m.
* Reduced distance from end to explode from 6m to 4m.

**Developer Note:** These changes should make the Cluster Seeker Mine feel a bit more responsive.  


**Bug fixes**  


* Fixed missing dialogue localization for Brazilian Portuguese on Stadia.
* Fixed an issue causing developer UI elements being visible in the Language and Settings menu.
* Implemented improvements for data streaming issues on PlayStation 4.
* Fixed an issue that could cause in-game settings to reset after a player respawns.
* Fixed an issue causing the Seasonal Manhunt progress to reset when changing Directives.
* Fixed an issue causing the Apparel Event Urban Jungle schedule to not show correctly in-game.
* Fixed an issue causing Target Intel to be delivered to the mailbox. This was now removed as Target Intel is no longer used in the game.
* Fixed an issue causing the Sticky Bomb to not do damage under certain circumstances.
* Fixed an issue causing the Shock Trap deploys to be very close together when launched.
* Fixed an issue causing Global Difficulty to affect the Operation Dark Hours raid.
* Fixed an issue causing Specializations to not unlock while owning the Ultimate Edition or having purchased the Year 1 Bundle.
* Fixed an issue causing Season rewards to be skipped and instead giving players duplicates when gaining multiple Season Levels.
* Fixed an issue causing the objective “Complete the Roosevelt Island Mission on Hard or Higher Difficulty” to not count towards the Daily Project Outcast Hunt.
* Fixed an issue that could cause the Level 35 Season reward to not be delivered.
* Fixed an issue causing unintended Health values on Shields.
* Fixed an issue causing Season Ranks to be reset.
* Fixed an issue that caused League Mission Timers to reset when a Rogue encounter wiped the group.",1,1585050051,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo3prx/title_update_84_patch_notes/,thedivision,1

fo3loa,CumanMightBoi,Joining other factions/Fully customizing your faction,"What if we had decided that every single faction in the game is incompetent to rule the DC and wanted to change it?

 Division's storyline is a linear one which, though has its pros, heavily stricts the potential of this game's RPG aspect and shows no flexibility to bend how things go to other way around. So, what I suggest is either being able to join an already existing faction in order to change it or creating our own with fully-customizable mechanics.

 What this entirely game changer addition would do is to let the player decided for his own world. Its quite natural to feel that division is not always the option, while considering that every other faction went through the same catastropic events as the division and have their own unique reasons to rival the division. 

 If the main reason why devs should add this mechanic to begin with is dealt with then we can go on to talk about how this could be implemented, another bad thing about the division factions was that every faction member is devoted to their faction fully and doesn't feel any need to change it or try to get to the top. What our agent would do is to support a leader in this particular faction to get to the top, essentially creating a civil war and gaining control of the faction. 

 Or going for a fundemental change and creating your own faction by starting from the start and designing your own units, basically deciding which strategy they want to go with. Way this could be done is taking control of strategical points across the map to provide your units with essential means.

This mechanic would not only change the game from its core but would also add hundreds of hours of gameplay and a seasons long content for players.

I'm sure I'm not the only smart here thought of this but hope that devs will see this and similar posts.",6,1585049451,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo3loa/joining_other_factionsfully_customizing_your/,thedivision,1

fo3inn,CalOfRivia,Solo Gotten Way Harder?,"Now I'm definitely just a casual Division player. I was enjoying playing solo and exploring the world. Basically treating it like a single player RPG. As such I'm not in the habit of keeping up to date with the news, updates etc.

However I just jumped back in after a month or so out and it feels like the game has gotten incredibly hard for solo players. I used to have very little trouble with regular mobs and could manage the more difficult sections if I was careful. But in the space of an hour I got downed 5 times. I don't think I died that many times in my previous 20 hours with the game combined.

Enemies seemed harder to kill, more seemed to spawn and every time I tried to assault a control point it felt like kicking a hornets nest with enemies spawning all around. Plus my skills seemed to be doing less damage/being destroyed faster.

I noticed the gear system seems to have changed, is it a case of the gear I had is no longer suitable and I need to pick up some new stuff?

I was enjoying the game in a casual fashion but if it's switched and gonna require me to grind then I'm done. I've got enough games in my backlog to get through without The Division kicking my ass because I had the audacity to take a break.",14,1585048973,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo3inn/solo_gotten_way_harder/,thedivision,1
fo3ibe,mercury_1967,What to do while Massive is fixing the game,"It's slow - they're rolling out patches little by little, incrementally. I won't get into who thinks what needs to be patched when - a ridiculous amount of other threads have been posted here about that stuff.

Personally, I've been having a blast since WoNY dropped. I'm a solo-only player, so admittedly a lot of the issues I don't even encounter. When WoNY launched I got my first character up to 40 and have been playing that one exclusively since. But they're still working on the game and the broken parts of the game pretty much exclusively affect just end-game activities, so I started my second character on the NY campaign last week. That'll take me a while - going through the NY campaign and then working on getting some decent builds set up for the character.

Then when that character is in a good place I'll take a look at the state of the game and if it looks like more fixing needs to be done or will be done I'll start a third character. That'll take quite a while, so I'm sure that by the time that one is up to 40 and has one or two decent builds the game should be in a good place.

All of that means that I still get to play the game I love and will for the most part be minimally affected by the stuff that needs to be fixed.",1,1585048926,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo3ibe/what_to_do_while_massive_is_fixing_the_game/,thedivision,1

If you don’t have any explosives or special ammo, those stations are impossible to take out if they’re out of your line of sight. The enemies then just sit there eating bullets for breakfast.

I started playing the Division 1 pretty late (Post 1.8 patch IIRC) and I absolutely loved it, got to world tier 5 in no time and was solo running everything I could. I still play sometimes, although not as often anymore. For someone that absolutely loved D1, how is D2 in comparison? Unfortunately I don't get much time to game (hence jumping on so late *again*) so I don't really want to waste money if the game isn't like the original. I've read a lot of the posts on here and **a lot** of them are complaints, is the general consensus that they've gone backwards? (Destiny 2 @ launch anyone?) or is it more just a significant amount of balance issues, but still a playable, enjoyable game?

fo1x5v,rubenalamina,The Division 2 Weekly Vendor Reset 24/03/2020,"Hi there fellow agents. Here's the latest vendor reset information for The Division 2.

# Notes
---

I finally was able to add the gear and skill mods after manually listing my mods and cross checking with a friend to update the names, attributes and values. I couldn't finish testing a new layout before reset but I will improve it tomorrow since we have less information to display on mods now. It will change automatically on the site.

I also added icons to the weapon attributes just to make them look better.

See you next Tuesday.

# Items on Sale
---

Here's the web page link for all the items available in the game. It will always be the same link. It's my personal website and I don't run any kind of ads.

https://rubenalamina.mx/the-division-weekly-vendor-reset/

I added a resources section with a map with 30+ locations to find the Snitch and a link to the datamined gear attribute sheet.

# Cassie
---

Cassie is a gunrunner vendor that moves location every couple of days. To find her, you need to talk to Jared ""The Snitch"" Nash in one of the locations I have listed on my map. His location is random but it usually takes 2 or 3 location visits for him to spawn. After you talk to him, he will give you a bounty and Cassie will appear on your map with a shopping cart icon. You can do the bounty or save it for later, it's not necessary to browse Cassie's inventory.

She will open for 24 hours and will close to relocate for 32 hours. These are her open times:

* **Sunday 7:00 PM EST**
* **Wednesday 3:00 AM EST**
* **Friday 11:00 AM EST**

# Thieves Den
---
 
The thieves den is a hidden location in each Dark Zone area. It is only revealed and accessible if you perform grey rogue actions, like hacking terminals or stealing landmark chests. Once you triangulate the location, it will be automatically shown on your map. You just need to go there and enter.

The thieves den vendor rotates between Dark Zones every day at 2am EST. You can see where he is located if you hover over your mouse or controller over each area. In the right side of the map screen you will see it at the bottom of the area's description.

# Resources
---

## Weapon Damage Calculator

I made a calculator to use it on my own and for the vendors. It can calculate the damage percentile of any weapon so you know if a roll is good or bad. To use it, just make a copy and input your weapon damage values from the character sheet in the first section or just the base damage value shown in game after enabling it in the weapons section of your inventory. The sheet has a short link in the instructions so you can share it or bookmark it more easily. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JRP7nhNVIs37ZquApIhKdjbM0QGv-R8EvjwC6aF7j8o/

## Timers Website

A couple of members of The Division Community Discord made a site that shows all the in game timers in your local time zone. It also has the open and close timers for Cassie so you can use it to check if she's open or not before you go find the snitch. The site can be accessed here: https://divisiontimers.com

## Wiki Page

The link for the current weekly thread and the vendor items list is always available in the [Vendor Reset Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/wiki/thedivision2/communityresources/vendors) in the community resources. You can find it in the top navigation menu of the subreddit. If you're on mobile, it will be on the sidebar.

# The Division 1 Reset
---

Some of the guys and girls in the vendors team are trying to keep The Division 1 vendor resets alive. The sheet will be automatically updated when they are done, even if they haven't posted their weekly thread. I will add an edit with the link to their weekly thread when they are ready. These reset happen on Friday nights at 7pm EST.

fo1mga,BravoeBello,Kind a rough rpg right now.,"Hi everyboody!


Yesterday with my team we tried in every way to make a legendary stronghold. So all my words here refeers to that difficulty.
Obviously we did not succeed and we made many attempts that stressed us a lot.

I'm making this post because I'm embittered by how tanks and doctors 's builds react in end game activities.

Tank: 
most tanks use a true patriot + yellow gear mixed build if i don't get wrong. 
My tanky friends use it and he have lot's of god rolls in it... 
Despite this, his shield does not bear more than 10 seconds of sustained damage.
I played a lot in division 1 and I remember d3 well. A d3 was able to stay and catch the fire of a minigun at high difficulty for quite a while.. THAT WAS REAL TANKING!
Feels like the Shield should be buffed a ""little"" in PVE.

Let's talk about Medic.
With my build as a doctor I have all god rolled on repair skills so the healing is pretty fine as quantity.

Unfortunately, however, the quantity is not enough. The hive is too slow to unlatch a cure and the chemical launcher is too risky to use most of the time. I tried to use the mine or the drone but are useless both.

So it seems that the medic has the numbers from his but not the support skills to face missions with high difficulties. He needs efficients healing skills and something to remove status. So i guess we will hope and wait for the Reclaimer's to return in game.

Oh i remembered something about status. DAMN GRANADES!

Enemies granades are OP as hell and there is no hand skill that could save you if you are a Dps or a full Technician.
Devs please give us a TROPHY SYSTEM or NERF GRANADES :)

thank you for reading it and tell me about your experience at high difficulties so i can get some tips about it!

fo142a,ImJustSlick,Specialization ideas?,"Was talking it over with people and I want to know what the community thinks for new specializations.

I'm thinking a good specialization could be a charge up shotgun, like nemesis. The damage is increased based on how close and how charged up the shotgun is. A low charge can be a close range attack and deal more damage up front and a charged up attack can have maximum damage from mid range. 

Long range wont have any applicable damage as so it isn't an all around weapon.

The skill for it can be like a mini warhound turret, so just a mobile turret that is weaker than the normal turret (of course) and also no debuff when destroyed.

Its main weapon type is of course shotguns. The attachment can increase crit hit damage by 15% and decrease crit hit chance by 10% and can be a barrel attachment.

When you use an armor kit all allies and your damage is increased by 10% for 10 seconds. And the armor kit can only repair itself to 90% armor until the 10 seconds is up which means you have 10% armor repir after the 10% damage buff is gone. (You are locked from full armor repair for 10 seconds).

And that's that. Feel free to criticize and apply your own specializations down below I would love to see your ideas agents!",3,1585035683,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo142a/specialization_ideas/,thedivision,1

fo0zct,iflod101,Leagues need to change in the future.,"I'm trying to solo Roosevelt Island sub 25 mins to get the backpack trophy, and in the process I've noticed some things that NEED to change about the way leagues are handled. 

  
1. Enemy compositions should be preset, not random. When I walk into the first squad of enemies, I will literally walk back and reset the mission if I see a bad enemy composition. It's completely unfair when the game decides I will randomly lose time by spawning a tank or elite heavy gunner. I can deal with them it's not that hard, but each one takes up extra time that I need. Even if each encounter was harder, I could learn each one and develop a strategy to deal with it. But I can't prepare for random squads. 

2. Bugs, bugs, and more run ruining bugs. I've lost count of how many times I've died because of the fake reload glitch. That or sometimes enemies get stuck behind a wall or door and I lose a good run. Absolutely infuriating. If these bugs can't or won't be fixed, then why does Massive think it's a good idea to add time trials into their game when these bugs will literally ruin runs for players?

3. Disable rouge agents. When rouges pop up I just sigh and let them kill me. They are an instant run ruiner which is, like the last 2 things, completely unfair. Not to mention my speed running build isn't set up to deal with rouges. 

4. Sniping cowards. You know that sniper right next to the final area? Almost EVERY run I attempt he just sits behind cover. He isn't difficult to kill, he's just a coward who wastes my time. Even when I switch to an MMR to kill him (which also wastes time) he just sits behind cover. I end up staring at his little tower screaming ""JUST SHOOT ME DAMMIT,"" but he just sits there and does nothing. And let's not even talk about the minigun dude who hides on his boat and refuses to attack. This isn't a big deal really, it's just extremely frustrating. I don't care if Massive turns up their aggression and makes them sniping aimbot gods, just for the love of god, PEAK! 

5. Scaling is ridiculous. There's a reason I only try this solo or duo. Anything past 2 players and it feels like it just isn't worth it. I would like to actually try this with a full squad but it doesn't seem worth it. Maybe if you have a fully optimized squad with complimentary builds, but even then I think solo or 2 man is just more efficient. 

Anyways these are just the things that are really frustrating to deal with. I know that my build is fully capable of getting a sub 25 run and I've gotten really close a few times. But sadly every time I get close I lose the run because of a fake reload, or an enemy gets stuck in a wall, or an extra tank spawns etc. It's annoying because it isn't a matter of skill, it's a matter of luck. Every little thing adds up. In this encounter, an enemy glitched behind a wall and I need to frag him out. - 20 seconds. In the next encounter, a tank spawns where he usually doesn't. - 10 seconds. At the end the goddamn sniper won't shoot. -5 seconds. And to top it all off I get a fake reload and die. I really like the idea of leagues and they have got me logging on every day, but it's also one of the most infuriating things I've encountered in all my years playing games. Some of you might say to just get a better build, but all of these points apply regardless of the build you're running. I'm not frustrated that I haven't been able to get a sub 25 run, I'm frustrated because when I don't it isn't because I messed up, it's because the game decided to screw me over.",23,1585034935,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo0zct/leagues_need_to_change_in_the_future/,thedivision,1

 However, I do not like running duos because the time to revive someone is time away from damage output on the enemy, and it allows the enemy to flank much easier. A third adds the ability to curtail some enemy advancement while keeping your team on their feet. 

Also, (I know it has been posted a million times and everyone complains about it) the scaling in this game is so broken. Trying to run the Federal Bunker with a squad of four is nye impossible.

fo09dg,CIA_Agent_99,Rogue Agents Spawned!!!,"Jump in to join 2 other Agents to the Taxi Graveyard CP at Level 4. Elites never stopped and after 10 or so minutes, finally, control point cleared. Right after that announcement, 4 Rogue Agents appeared. I ran out of ammo on the first one but that first agent went down. Changed to Stoner LMG and Sweet Dreams shotgun. One came around, took me down, had the hive and came back blasting, team mates assisted and got it down. The other 2 backed off and we chased them down one at a time. Finally they both came down. I can breath now, but No!!!! Black Tusk showed up assaulting the check point... I was like common!!!! Give me us a break!!! 

Bottom line, after a total intense fighting of 20+minutes to take a CP Lvl4, Elites that don't seem to run out, 4 Rogue Agents to deal with, a group of Black Tusk trying to take the CP, running out of ammo between fights and NO freaking Exotic or any other? Are you freaking serious? Really? There are high-end drops, purple and green ones, not a single attribute on any weapon or gear had a god-roll. Its like, WTF??????

I thought I did well with a DPS build and a t-shirt for armor. Went down only once and got up using my Hive. Got the other agents revived at least one each. 

And NO!!!! Exotic? NO!!! God-roll on anything? I level up 2 or 3 times on Seasons in this one CP and just turns my hair on fire!!!",23,1585030882,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fo09dg/rogue_agents_spawned/,thedivision,1

fnzr2n,IC4TACOS,"Division agents ( ya know, us ) are currently the weakest faction in the game"," ***This is just a rant on random things that have been aggravating me about the game recently, idk if my points are entirely correct, so I apologize if they aren't***

&amp;#x200B;

To give a rundown of all the things that are supposed to be unique to us

\- SHD tech, highly advanced technology that agents can use in battle to get the upper hand, as well as a wide array of weapons that are specific to only us, and a wide array of healing abilities that allow agents to sustain themselves on the battlefield

\- Extremely versatile armor that allows us to replace one leg piece, as well as the crotch piece and be fully repaired

\- Ability to adapt and use any form of weaponry which should theoretically give us a combat advantage on the field

\- Ability to know when enemies are peeking through the revolutionary use of our invisible shoulder-mounted camera

\- Face masks to block airborne contamination

\- Ability to augment our abilities by tinkering gear we work hard to ~~pilfer~~ gather from the surrounding area

With such a wide array of things, agents should be the most unique faction in the game, with them constantly bringing something new to every fight, but in the end it turns out none of this matters due to the fact that...

\- Literally anyone can use SHD tech now, it's been handed out like candy, on top of the fact that they use it infinitely better than we could ever hope to use. Enemies don't need unique weapons because they can sniper us from any distance, and burst us from close range with their weapons, they're even better at healing themselves ( at least Black Tusk are ) because they can't be kicked out of their healing, ***and*** it takes less time than us 

\- As mentioned they can heal faster than us, sustain themselves better, and their base armor provides them with complete bullet immunity until it is broken

\- No need to adapt for new weapons, any weapon they use can be turned into a weapon of mass destruction, even Hyenas with their SMG's have more effective range than our Rifles

\- Are constantly aware of when we are peeking and will stay undercover throughout the entire duration of us aiming at them, however the second we look away they will peek out to shoot us. 

\- Have immune systems capable of keeping them alive through any amount of poison unless their body has already been turned into swiss cheese

\- Still have a slight advantage here, but that doesn't matter when even the highest stats for tank and skill builds provide nothing for us. Enemy armor grants them invulnerability, enemy tanks run at us with glee knowing their armor can take far more shots than our pathetic paper mache armor.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I have to ask, why are Division agents suddenly a joking matter? We went from being some of the top dogs on the block to be reduced to nothing, and while I understand the reasoning behind Rouges, and other factions using our gear. The solid fact behind the matter is we went from being unique weapons of mass destruction to being bullet fodder for the most unorganized groups. 

We went from being the most technologically advanced, with only Black Tusk rivaling us, to being made to look like primitives. 

We went from being unstoppable tanks to getting ripped through regardless of stats. Hell, they're even stronger than every agent, able to completely destroy most agents armor in a single gun butt, and throw grenades further than we could ever dream. 

I guess one of my main questions, is why are we not allowed to adopt? It seems everyone else has grown to fight us, but we're stagnant. Black Tusk has gained new abilities, new tactics, and every faction has gained new things. But we only gained things that ***agents that gave up on The Division made themselves.*** Please, I doubt anyone will even bother reading down this far, but please give us the ability to feel unique and separated from the factions again. I want to feel like I'm supposed to be the top-dog on the block, even if a few shots of spice bullets turn me into a bumbling idiot that can't aim. I want to ***feel like the last hope like I have unique abilities that others hope to achieve one day, I don't want to feel like a washed-up has-been in a game where I'm supposed to be a highly-trained sleeper agent.***",103,1585028124,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnzr2n/division_agents_ya_know_us_are_currently_the/,thedivision,1
fnzqe7,snakedocs,My thoughts on the damage glitch,"I don’t think a single person would have an issue with the damage glitch if it was kept out of the dark zone. Who cares if we can 1 shot a gold bar in PVE, it’s not like it negatively affects anyone else’s experience, it only adds to yours. 

But the moment someone brings that shit into the darkzone it becomes a different story. I personally enjoy the PVP in the darkzone especially in this update. With so much build diversity it makes the PvP challenging. But it ruins the experience when you get some twat waffle who feels the need to go do a damage glitch so he can kill other players. Which results in people complaining about it which leads to the devs patching it. 

No complaining = easier farming in PVE. 


Tl:DR If you feel the need to go do the DPS glitch, stay out of the DZ. it ruins the experience for everyone and will make it get patched sooner because people will complain about it.",54,1585028018,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnzqe7/my_thoughts_on_the_damage_glitch/,thedivision,1

I know that sniper turret has had its fair share of bugs over the past year, but has anyone noticed it being even more temperamental than usual in the past couple weeks?

I switched to Sniper Turret from Clusters after the new xpac due to poor seeker pathing and low damage output; now when the turret works, it's super fun, but the challenge of the game shouldn't come from the skill not even working half the time.

This could be the premise of Div3 or an expansion where you join a different faction and go rouge. You would be allied with X faction and have to face roaming JTF, other factions, and the SHD AI agent.

Another idea may be that you we're put into a predicament like the first wave agents; your orders are to stay, fight, and die or to abandon your mission and go rouge. Instead of being hunted, you could explain to the Division Leader that you had no choice, and beg to be taken back in and made an agent again. Or you can roam and kill AI agents, JTF, and join another faction.

Game would be harder but it would make an interesting gameplay IMO.

I am really annoyed by all the bugs and glitches as most of the gamers. But please people, keep one thing in mind;

The world is currently not the same as it was a few weeks ago. The virus is spreading all over the world, killing people and changing the lives of almost everyone - and this includes the developers too, of course. 

I am sure that they have family and friends which they are worried about too, they must protect them and themselves too.

So please do currently not blame them for not fixing any bug, glitch or whatever. 

Don’t you think there are more important things at the time than fixing a game?!

I hope that all of you, the gamers and the developers are doing fine, are not getting sick and that we all get through this hard time unharmed.

I am lvl 25, I guess that's not pretty good but I am not playing it for like 10 hours everyday... I play it occasionally.

Tonight I entered Dark Zone, my god.... I am being killed every two steps I make... I killed one named guy and got a very good handgun and few other cool items, game told me to go to Extraction point.

Reached Extraction point and I was like ""Yey, got myself a beast of a handgun"", when my soldier shot a flare into sky a HORDE of enemies attacked me within seconds, I didn't even attacked them. I sneaked on them and then just escaped to other street lol. When I went back timer reached 0 seconds so I got close to the extraction point thinking that items are sent up to the heli but I got killed at that point but I didn't care about it...

When I respawned I saw that items are not in my inventory at all, they were located at my death location. I was very mad at that point so I tried to pick them up and extract them again but I had no success...

Tried it like 15 times. I just can't kill those bas**rds... I have 3500 DMG Assault rifle and 20000 DMG Sniper rifle. I can one shot one kill enemies outside DZ, about Assault rifle I know, it's sh*t but I can't even buy a better one. Vendors have no better weapons.

Any suggestions how I can kill enemies in DZ? Should I just play outside DZ until I finish all missions so I can finally enter DZ with better weapons?

My goal is to finish all Missions, Side missions and Encounters and I am close to achieve that. But I feel that soon I won't be able to even kill normal enemies. :(

I was thinking about maybe we could have some exotic mods, be it gear/weapon/skill mods. 
These exotics wouldn’t simply have better stats but add some flavor into the moded gear. 

Example of some exotic mods:

- sights for weapons: increases hit scan areas on enemies heads making headshots easier to land. 

- gear blue mod: makes you immune to first hit you take (first bullet only) with 30 secs cooldown 

- chem launcher heal mod: when your armor is below 25% automatically drops 1 heal at your feet without having to equip it. Cooldown 45 sec.

fnw9jp,DarkRogueHunter,Fanboying Here: Did I just matchmake into a group of unstoppable players?,"Evening Everyone,

Hope everyone is healthy and safe!

So last night I was farming Bullet King on Heroic (No directives), and saw that LMG TL fell on 'The Tombs' for the first time I have seen in a while. Didn't want to pass up this opportunity, so I began farming in matchmaking (I sometime group with a clan member now and then and occasional friendlist player, but mostly I'm a solo player). I grouped up with some different people; some who left after a single wipe, and some who wiped once or twice but we finished off Parnel in the end. Now about 12 time in or so I did Tombs I group up with 3 other players, and they seemed like normal players. Man was I wrong, because they were good, like scary good. I ran a high crit build when I hit 40 and did some impressive damage, but these guys were 1-3 hit killing everything. Examples of this were as such; the cafeteria section where even on Heroic you can wipe at least once if your not careful, nope took like a minute to clear. Then when taking on 'The Judge' he broke through the wall as usual, but died before hitting the ground. Lastly, that long stretch of road leading to Parnel where the end had two turrets, well I was hopping the scaffolding, they were pretty much at the end mowing down everyone and not stopping for cover. If I didn't see it for myself, I would have through it wasn't real.  

As I said when I hit 40 I tried a high DPS crit build with some god rolls in there, but even could never pull off the damage these guys were doing. I was running The Tombs heroics on my new Skills build, (not enough to get me through Legendary, but I could hold my own in Heroics), but running with these guys felt like I was a 5 year old trying to catch up and fight alongside trained Navy Seals. With every build I have been working on I can't melt bad guy armor fast enough and I loose mine slower, but partnering with these guys put doubts in my mind about the current scaling issues and bullet spongeness were experiencing.

Anyways, whoever you players are (sorry I didn't get your names, other then RuSirius), but you guys are wicked good players, hopefully I can group up with you again, I go by DarkUnity on Div2.

fnujxa,OrbitalShark,[PSA] NY and DC players can play together.,"Not sure if this has been posted before, but no results in Reddit search, so here I am.

Players who own the Warlords expansion can still join those who don't own the expansion.

**Simple rules that apply:**
**1**, the NY player has to join the DC player. It doesn't work the other way around.
**2**, you have to have finished Warlords story to be able to join. 
**3**, you can still earn level 40 gear,
**4**, no season XP will be earned while in the lower player's session (the season menu item is removed from the options screen).

3 of us joined another friend who was still on the fence about getting the DLC, but we still had a blast and got sh1t done as Agents do.

I've searched high &amp; low for information about this as it seemed silly to completely divide the player-base, and I'm glad to say I was wrong.

fnujvc,TheInternetJanitor,I think skill mods should work like the recal library,"You have zero reason to keep duplicate mods, since you can't put more than one for a certain slot in a certain skill. You can change what goes in the slot, but that means changing a different stat.

Having a skill mod library that works like the recal library would mean not having to dig through a pile of mods to find that one with 0.001% better stats.

If they ever decide to give mods some more variety or power they could still fit into a library system.

At the moment I am always sad to see skill mods drop. They mean so little and they are so annoying to organize in stash/inventory it demotivates players to even bother checking to see if a drop is a fraction of a percent increase. Even if the mods themselves are never changed, a library system would make inventory management much less painful.",47,1585006601,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnujvc/i_think_skill_mods_should_work_like_the_recal/,thedivision,1

I've hit max level and advanced to the final world tier - and I do have some decent equipment - but I'm not quite sure what the best route for finishing a build would be?

I know everyone says the Dark Zone gives high quality gear the most consistently, but when you're at this stage I feel like the Dark Zones aren't as viable as people think it is. When your loadout isn't quite maximized, it feels like a lot of activities in the DZ are sort of off-limits. I've only been successful with the normal difficulty areas so far, but if it's a supply drop or sometimes even just regular mobs it's game over.

Doesn't really help that I'm spec'ing a sniper build so I'm a little too squishy for solo play in such an area.

I, like many others, bought the DLC as a way to return to the game, and bought one of the Specializations with the intention of playing the DLC with a new specialization. I was immensely disappointed to discover that this bug prevents that. Though others have complained on the Ubisoft forums, there has been no resolution or timetable for a fix other than confirming it is indeed a bug and that “it will be passed along to the team”. 

Weeks have passed and I have filed for a charge-back with my bank as others on the forums have done. I hope that all affected do the same.

We were meant to progress our gear slowly over the next few months, and work up towards legendaries and min/maxed gear.  With 'Loot 2.0', acquiring god-roll gear is much easier, and gear itself has been fairly simplified.  With people speed running legendaries in 8-12 minutes, and acquiring all god-roll gear from those.... you basically have nothing to work towards for a few months.

Ouch.  The next few months are going to be rough.  They will fix the NPC scaling and maybe even give exotics the ability to be upgraded... but what then?  People will say there is nothing to do, and 'ded game' this...

fnphce,Datboibarloss,CONFIRMED CAMPUS SETTLEMENT BLOCKADE GLITCH,"So, long story short: DO NOT start World Tiers without visiting Campus Settlement.

Here’s the story. 

I’ve just started Division 2 about a week ago. I flew through the first part of the game (before World Tier 1) by mainly just doing missions, rarely ever visiting settlements, since the White House is so much better. I had a mission to talk to Henry Hayes, but I didn’t think it was all that important. *Boy was I wrong.* So I continue my journey to the next World Tier (1), and upon doing so I notice, of course, that Campus Settlement has been blockaded. I clear the blockade and am greeted with the message “blockade lifted” and a yellow “Campus” symbol.

However, as I travel to Campus Settlement, I notice it’s still blockaded. The gate wouldn’t lift no matter what and I was unable to fast travel to Campus Settlement. After a few days of posting here trying, to figure out what the HELL is going on, I decide to really go full investigator mode. I found out on some old post that if you roll into the container blocking the settlement, you can glitch inside.

*This is where I realized the severity of the glitch I encountered.*

Upon glitching into the Campus Settlement (the ONLY way I was able to get in) I was greeted with a cutscene showing off the settlement and as I checked the map.. I COULD NOW FAST TRAVEL!

Im telling this whole story so that it’s clear to everyone that the Settlement was glitched and inaccessible unless glitched into. 

*This was caused _directly_ by not visiting Campus Settlement before moving to World Tiers, I’m 99% certain*",4,1584989373,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnphce/confirmed_campus_settlement_blockade_glitch/,thedivision,1

fnmczh,IamEli247,"Hey Massive and Ubisoft, Hope you all are Ok During these times. With Sincerity embedded with this Post, I must talk to you about Some Things.","TL;DR Bottom.

So, I am , By no means Intelligent about Game development and all its aspects. With that said, I would like to address the SAME key issues and why It took a long time for me to personally (Finally) make a post regarding the AI, their Programming/Logic etc. 

\-Doing Legendary SHs, I just had to ask myself "" why cant I one shot them like they can to me?"" "" why Not have the Enemies armor scale with My armor, and a 2-4 Man scale should Average out their Armor to what is Optimally 'Fair' "" 

\-with the last point mentioned, I'd Say look how the Stock market works... wait no bad way.. better example would be I buy a share for $12 but it goes down to $9. So I buy 2 or 3 more shares of that $9 Price and now my Overall Position in that stock averages between the middle. thus BALANCING my Price position. Not quite the solution but the overall Idea of Averaging. 

\-The enemies feel like they have 500k-1mil Damage per Bullet. 

\- Now I remember some games, I believe this one and the first, always had a damage exploit that players abused due to the scaling and difficulty being bestowed upon them. I admit, I am one of those people that did. BUT HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED: it FINALLY felt Fair. I get 1 Shot, they get 1 shot. It all came down to skill. Yes you could steamroll a mission but the fact you could just get killed so quickly, and so can they, AND THAT'S ..... WHAT MADE THE GAMES FUN. that intensity of ANYONE can get Dropped quickly. Stacking a few Million on a weapon isn't at all to go for but if you give the enemies Damage numbers close to 1 mil, I can't see the reasoning of giving every gun a buff that boosts every number to be able to get 1 million. 1 million damage is still tickling the enemies at times. 

\-I recall a Exploit in Div 1 (correct me if wrong about this please) but you could Stack infinite damage. I usually just topped my weapons off to 1 million. then I ran high level missions and had the most fun I have had ever because it felt FAIR now. I told people in the group ""THIS Is what ENDGAME should feel like."" The Goal of Endgame should be to Max Level your stats, builds, to the point where Legendary Feels Like Hard but You know you can still get 1 tapped very quickly and you realize you do Millions of Damage but they don't get 1 tapped as Quickly as thought. With THAT REALIZATION, You've effectively have made heroic and legendary Still as scary as is before. 

\- God bless Shield Gating, But what about Cover Gating? IE: When i shoot a legendary Mini-gunner boy from cover, ya I get laser beamed, but when the Animation to crouch back to cover is going, I'm still  getting Shot. Consider Cover Gating or I-Framing that animation please. 

\- If you want the Players to have a power fantasy but yet want them to feel the increasing difficulty test their builds, Let us have our Hard Earned Damage Back please. we should have Guns that can go in the millions. Absurd? well so is a simple red Legendary doming me for 1 million BLIND FIRE .  If they 1 shot, So should I. Period. Giving a major boost to all guns across the board will give you what you want the players to practice: BUILD DIVERSITY. 

\-For IRL Example:  We are  on CV Lock down, no ones working. so Government is giving a financial Alleviation  (Kinda) for all so we DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COSTS while we handle our lives. You give us a major Flat damage Boost and that allows everyone to experiment with builds. Which is what you've been encouraging  all these Updates. 

\-About me: I have my Gear to where I deem it ""good enough"" but still had to struggle with thinking how to balance my Preference for Armor and skill across the board. I want to do damage.....but I also want to be not 1 shot by a blind fire. 

TL;DR: Give us Hard Grinding Agents the Damage we deserve Across the board and Heroic/ Legendary will still be as hard as it is still. Figure out how to Average out 2-4 man Scaling armor to where the Computed Outcome is 50/50 in terms of Fairness. Build diversity is suffering because the lack of Damage we Have Because many crave that power fantasy so they go all Reds. Give us the damage, We give you the Cool builds  you want to see.",0,1584979272,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnmczh/hey_massive_and_ubisoft_hope_you_all_are_ok/,thedivision,1

Its not that the open world isn't operating as intended.  I have seen factions roll up to CPs and fight them as intended.  But they never ever win. I saw this once randomly and then decided to just hang out and watch at other locations.  I did this in NY and DC.  I watched countless encounters and the JTF/Peace Keepers won every single time.  Its very clear that my world is all green CP's (with almost no activities in the area to farm as a result) because the factions can't win those battles.  

I know you have a gigantic list of items to tackle, and this wont likely be a priority given the game breaking DPS and invincibility glitches, but perhaps its an easy fix if you just have to tone down how strong they are at control points.  Just doing my part to help find solutions instead of complaining that the CPs are still broken.  I may be dead wrong, but I still wanted to throw this out there.

fnkurk,Igbriel,A chat about Loot (my experience)," Good Morning,  
 

let's chat about rewards  
 

I, personally, still think that the game loot is not very rewarding.   
 

Let me explain ... We always play, my bro and me, on the xbox. We both  work and we can't spend the whole day farming ... so, for us, who have  two hours a day (during the week) to try to get something good, it is  almost impossible to get something that builds up. This weekend SOLED --  I don't know if you have this slang but... I did alone --  3 (hard)  lvl3 control points and a lvl4 (challenging) and didn't drop anything  ... neither exotic nor anything that contributed to the build (which I  couldn't even assemble right after attualization).  
 

I think a level 4 should drop at least 1 exotic ( I refer to exotic as if they were... they should be... the apex of the game's loot)  or something really good  on the hard and up level. I would like to have the same feeling that I  had playing the Diablo 3's endgame for example ... where I knew that  I'll have to work hard, that I would die, but in the end it was sure  that something good would come in two hours (or whatever 3) of game ...  either during or at the end.

Again...   I refer to the exotic as if they were and they should be the peak of the game in the sense of drop ... I don't play just to get them ... in fact ... until today the only exotic I hunted was Nemesis ... that I broke after the att ... and another thing ... I do have fun with the game ... I think the season gave a new life ... but I wanted to have this feeling of progression, you know? to keep the same equipment when I knew I was at the top ... today I have a build that I think is good but that I know has to improve a lot...  and I feel stuck with it.

  
I would like to know if someone, who has little time to play, feels the  same ... and if anyone has any tips for people like us without enough  time.

fnktse,Brosthetic,The lady death skill build - almost infinite clusters.,"So, for thos who didnt know, the lady death ""breath free"" buff will work wonderfully with a sniper turret (so long as you dont switch weapon whilst its deployed) so thought I would share my build with you all:

4 piece hard wire:
Mask
Holster 
Gloves 
Knee pads 

All spec with skill damage. 

Wyvern wear chest piece with ""skilled"" talent 
(Skills have a 25% chance to refresh all skill cool downs) 

Acostas go bag (very important for double rate of fire on sniper turret with over charge)

How it works: 

Run around with lady death to build stacks, take cover, throw a grenade immediately followed by clusters (wait for cool down on clusters to pop) then throw up the sniper turret - feedback loop with give cluster back here so wizz them out again.. now the turret will have double rate of fire, with a 60% damage buff from lady death (do not switch weapons) and EVERY shot has a 25% chance to refresh cluster mines.

Ensure you wait for the go bag perk to refresh before trying again (30 second cool down roughly)

You could still farm them from CPs and buy the weekly ones from Inaya to move it along faster, but having BP grinding integrated into the seasons would be a nice way to help us fill out the crafting library over a season or two at a steady pace, regardless of what we're doing to level up the pass.

I leveled up to 20 and just realized that with the Warlords of new york extension there is a character boost to level 30.

For me it is not clear if I still get this when I buy the game now or if it was only for pre-order? any experiences? 

sucks that I leveled so far and basically that would go to waste since I might get a boost.",11,1584972043,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnkf45/question_is_the_level_30_boost_only_for_preorder/,thedivision,1
fnke9q,Sobtam96,Big game hunter trophy tips,"Description for this trophy is to complete a bounty from each safe house. However this is the most misleading description ever. What the game actually wants from you is to kill a boss from each district where a safe house is located. Those are Foggy Bottom, West End, Constitution Hall, Downtown East, Federal Triangle, East Mall, Judiciary Square, Southwest and West Potomac Park. You don't have to do anything from the safe house except unlocking it. Boss will spawn once you complete all projects for each districts. You can find out what those are by hovering your cursor over a safe house icon. Keep in mind that you have to kill all enemies and not just the boss. You will know that a mission is complete once a ""Bounty is completed"" note appears on your screen and Manny congratulates you on doing it. There are tons of guides on this, however I found them all a bit confusing and misleading, hope this helps someone who is having same troubles as I was this past days trying to get this trophy.",0,1584971947,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnke9q/big_game_hunter_trophy_tips/,thedivision,1

fnk2so,alaric83,Tempted to buy: How often do AI factions fight each other?,"I've been keeping an eye on Division 2, but ended up not buying it. Now with the new sales, I am seriously considering plunging into it.

However, I have a specific question: How often do we see AI factions fight against each other ? This can be two enemy factions fighting during a scripted mission or in the open world, or the player's allied faction helping the player out during firefights.

This really, really contributes to me to the atmosphere of the game, and to give the impression of a living, breathing world. 

To give an example of a direct competitor of The Division, there are many many places in Destiny and Destiny 2 where hostile AI factions are in all-out war against each other. The player needs to navigate this huge battlefield, and this is just huge fun for me.

Does this happen often in Division 2 ? If so, does it happen only in scripted missions or also in the open world ? And does it sometime include allied NPCs (i read something about ""JTF"" soldiers)

fnjxtt,unitool,"Finally ran into the bullet sponge enemies last night. Sure, I need to get good, but it was also no fun at all, which I think is supposed to be why we play games.","I’d only ever seen people complaining about the bullet sponge enemies u til last night when I encountered them myself, and they suck all the fun right out of the game. 

I answered a call for assistance and joined a group who were doing the event where the sledgehammer guy is in breaking down the metal door while you’re busy fighting off wave after wave of enemies in a small area. Sorry I can’t remember the name, but I remember playing it solo and having a lot of fun. 

It was pure bullshit last night. The room is hell ass small for 4 players and approximately a million enemies. The designers send an absolute flood of guys at you, including nearly bulletproof flamethrower women, and an endless supply of those guys who will just kick you in the face while you are busy unloading a magazine into their face. 

There’s almost no room to maneuver, and the area is so small and cover is so difficult and the enemies tank so much damage that the end result is that there is nowhere safe. If you tried to cover from one asshole, you ran into 4 more. Add in the superglue stickiness of the cover objects, and the whole thing was really fucking aggravating. 

4 of us tried for at least an hour to clear this one stupid room, including countless revives. We thought we came close to clearing the event so many times, but never did. I was laughing about how stupid it is, but one of the guys in the group I joined was RANTING!

The final straw for me was when we’d *finally* gotten everything whittled down to just the sledgehammer guy. We’re working on him while trying to avoid him in the small area, and the game spawns in ANOTHER wave of enemies, this time from all 4 sides at once, which was really unfair because the room only had enemy entrance spots on 3 sides. I looked at the compass, saw red all around us, and I knew I was done for the the night. 

I finally gave up because it wasn’t fun anymore. I don’t mind a challenge, but when a challenge turns into a slog because of bullet sponge enemies and poor event design, I lose interest pretty fast. 

This particular event would be easy to fix by just adjusting the flow of enemies into the room to be a little less ridiculous.

Yes, I need to get good, but I also think the game needs to get fun in certain regards.",143,1584970026,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnjxtt/finally_ran_into_the_bullet_sponge_enemies_last/,thedivision,1

So I recently started playing the divison2, big fan of division1. I'm still level 10, however it seems like i've joined just in time for the Gear 2.0 update.  


However from what I see at low levels RED (wpn dmg) items give me 1.0% - 1.2% weapon damage, which is ridiculous. Where as the YELLOW (skill tier), gives me +1 skill tier, which is an insane boost in skill dmg.  


My question is - is there any unwritten damage boost from RED's or its just the 1.0%, because that's really low...

fnjsz5,TheMasterofDome,"Some more bugs, feedback (including video)","I'm glad to see Massive is at least aware of most of the bugs and is working on fixing them. The sheer amount and impact of them is baffling, but I'll happily wait until everything is a bit more steady :)

I've collected and recorded some bugs, not all of which I saw on the latest update here, so hopefully you (Massive) can take this into account and look into fixing them. I've been trying to record bugs as I see them and uploaded them to YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMe\_1xzYTTPmP1X\_VM6gV-1lkD5RrrFaR](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMe_1xzYTTPmP1X_VM6gV-1lkD5RrrFaR)), but there's not many of them there at the moment: I stopped playing because the game is simply too frustrating at the moment :')

My list of bugs I've encountered so far, loosely ordered in terms of my priority:

* One enemy always (98% of the time) gets stuck in the spawn area. this happens for missions, CP's, activities, you name it. Sometimes you can kill them (because thank god cover is often broken as well) by shooting a grenade launcher at an invisible crack in the wall. Sometimes they disappear after some minutes. And sometimes you just have to restart whatever you were doing from scratch.
* Some enemies are quite often invisible: they will appear on the thread radar and shoot at you, but are otherwise completely invisible, even when standing right next to them (no name tag either).
* Sound bugs.. sound bugs EVERYWHERE! It was already bad before WoNY, where especially minigun and grenade sounds almost never worked, but now that that seems to be better you have no sound/freezing sound/disappearing sound/missing sound in every other place. I'm sorry, it's hard to make this more specific at the moment. I haven't found a reliable way yet of recording the in-game sound.
* Striker's talent triggers on shooting teammates/allies.
* You always have to load twice when playing with a partner. E.g. after teleporting home you load, and then immediately upon spawning you are thrown back into the loading screen to load *again* into exactly the same spot.
* Re-calibration: The first attribute seems to not be able to get selected. When you select the first attribute to be re-calibrated, it always loads up the core attribute instead. Seems to be a visual bug.
* iCUE integration crashes after the game closes: random (TD2-related) light effects keep happening in a very spastic manner.
* When you're standing close to Inaya you can only open the crafting bench instead of talking to her. 
* Inaya sound bug: She says she has nothing to sell, even when she definitely does.
* I can never revive my teammate. Literally never since TU8. It shows ""Reviving"" upon pressing F, with nothing happening.
* Last update corrupted my installation: missing/flickering textures everywhere. My buddy also had his installation corrupted, but he just had his entire PC frozen every time he Fast Traveled somewhere. Don't get me wrong: I like bug fixes! I just like bug fixes that don't introduces more bugs *even more*. A verify+fix solved the issue by the way.
* For some reason there is always a resource convoy coming to the CP I'm attacking or the activity I'm doing. This results in the enemy sending in wave after wave after wave of enemies with me having no idea what's going on, because the resource convoys do not show up on the current activity tracker. No kidding, I have had multiple times where I had to fight off 15 waves of enemies for a simple propaganda activity, only to see some resources on the ground when it was finally over.

Some gameplay remarks, most of which have been mentioned in this subreddit before, so let's not get into that discussion. I still wanted to mention them here quickly to show that there's one more player who does not agree at all with these design choices.

* Enemies are completely unphased at getting 200 rounds of LMG bullets shoved into their face.
* Still cannot skip the ""Stronghold unlocked"" animation
* Still cannot skip the Epilepsy warning and intro logos
* Still have to restart the game after new patch data.
* New enemy AI is ""suicide only"". They get away with it too due to the massive amounts of armor they have.
* Would be great to have a way to sort mods/gear.
* Ally (e.g. the CP Friendly reinforcements) NPC's deal exactly 0 damage. Ok maybe 1.
* Exotics like the Chatterbox, Diamondback, and others are near useless due to the removal of damage or talents.
* Exotics in general are completely unrewarding: they're too easy to get and too useless to be any fun.
* Instead of the super-long extract-timer in the re-calibration library, it would be better to have a (single) Undo option.

Some things I definitely do like since TU8:

* Overall visuals and graphics quality. This has never seized to amazed me and I'm very happy New York is living up to my expectations.
* New dialogue in the Camp White Oak mission.
* New re-calibration library.",1,1584969443,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnjsz5/some_more_bugs_feedback_including_video/,thedivision,1

Many new players joined our ranks in the recent past and with the ""new"" update, Questions arose, 
and the same one's keep on coming, even like posting Lz Boss maps. 
Even myself with lots of hours keep on learning new stuff now and then. 

We have so many Agents who Test Stuff , Report Bug's try new things etc. and post about it.
But those post Vanish and are not connected, not added together. 

Even though we criticize this game recently a lot , we do so , because we love it. And we want it to improve and get some old strength back. 

I used to love Guild Wars 2 for the Game itself but also for the Wiki. If you look at this Wiki , maybe you will see what i mean.

There are so many Information's and mechanism not linked together, 
About Skills , Talents , Mods, everything !
Even Like Weapon Handling what is actually does. 
Or the Repair/ Recovery Attributes in Blue and Yellow (Armor and skill Attributes)


Like one sorted connected Page, example:

3 Topics (Main Page):  Damage (Red) / Armor (Blue)  / Skill (Yellow)
You click on Yellow , a new Pages opens explaining the basics and introduce every skill shortly. 
You click on seekermines for example. New Page.
Now you see every effect including the Levels ( Overcharge)
And on the bottom of the Page how you could Boost it / what could affect it ( links to Pages of Weapon or Armor Attributes/ Talents who Buff the Dmg or links to Gear Pages ( Branded or Gear Sets)  who Buff or affect those Skills.

Overcharge is a hyperlink , click on it , Bam, new page explaining what it is and how to get it. Linked.

So that everyone, doesn't matter if old or new , who wants to test new stuff or who is just unsure of what something's did can look it easily up. 

Where to get which Exotic .... explained there 
where to farm Which Hunter ....Explained there 
Like everything you need to know .... Explained there. 

We have so many Agents who know a lot of stuff and are unsatisfied with the Game at the Moment.
Please use your energy and your knowledge to help others and make the future brighter.

--&gt; Tldr.: Everyone let's try our best to give this Game a good wiki , for everyone.

fnihro,Archimebass,Legendary Missions are a joke right now- with videoproof,"Original post on Ubi forums: https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2204831-Massive-play-your-own-game?p=14853836

So, yeah. 3 of my clanmates and me tackled the legendary strongholds. No exploits/glitches/cheats were used, we're definitely not this kind of noob players. Anyway. First we finished District Union Arena, it was hard, but doable. Took us a few wipes, a few hours, but managed to get to the checkpoint and then first try the last boss. Cool.
Then, today, confident we could actually do it, we ""breezed"" through Roosevelt Island. Sure, took us three or four wipes, but generally it was a really fun and challenging experience.

Then, even more confident, we went in Capitol Building. Knowing very well that the first part in the open space will be hard and so it was. Wiped a few times, but eventually we got over it, struggled a bit in the ""lecture room"" inside. Two or more healers with healing boxes that cannot be targeted with seeker mines/hives or just EMP'd is just a ridiculous pain in the bottom, but patience was still on our side. Then we got to the last boss.

I mean, seriously, Massive- WTactualF. The boss himself ran to us in the checkpoint area and we dropped him kinda quickly and then slowly took care of the oncoming enemies. But there were some left in the main area. Where like four of the boss's healing boxes overlapped each other. Boxes that haven't disappeared after the bosses death. No way for us (two DPS builds, one tank and one CC) to get even a sliver of the boxes health as they kept healing each other. In the end, there was a ""Lucy"" robodog and an elite sniper left. After like 15 minutes of chasing the dog and trying to EMP him at one precise spot where there were no healing boxes, we got him and the sniper and finally finished the mission. To what end?

One (subjectively) very unimpressive outfit and a bag trophy? No epic weapon skin, no cool mask, no vanity keys, nothing special at all that would REALLY reward us for completing the ludicrous and really hard end-game content? Also all of three mission were done by the same four people. You'd think there would be at least one exotic drop, well...hell nah. And crates dropping purple gear? Even faction crates? Are you for real?

One last thing- legendary mission ran by people under 10, 20...hell, even thirty minutes? And no bans? I understand you can't set a bad precedent, but PLEASE- these useless glitching/cheating ""players"" really just destroy all the otherwise fun competition.

Embedded video is from said mission to give everyone an idea how ridiculous this has gotten. I enjoy the challenge of heroic/legendary, but there's also a line. This definitely crosses it.

fnhfmh,AzuraMegara,Skill Build Questions,"I have a few questions around setting up a skill build which I'm not certain how this is intended by Massive. My goal is to ""contruct"" a solo skill build that gets me through challenging content and maybe heroic.  

* Skill Tier and Overcharge 

How do get the setup into overcharge? I mean what is the specific trigger? I know, if I run the Acostas backpack, a grenade triggers the overcharge. But how do I do that if I simply run 6 utility core attributes? And as a follow up on that one, if I run skill tier 6 plus the technician specialization, is this pushing the setup in a constant overcharge?

* limitations for skill haste and skill damage

I know there is a cap for crit hit chance around 60%. Is there a cap for skill hast /skill damage too? Or is it designed the way it way before TU8, that skill haste is getting less and less effective as more you stack it?  
Or, if I rephrase the question, where is the sweet spot for both values and at what point it is more effective to invest in damage instead of haste?

* useful skill talents

What useful talents are worth being used in a skill build? So far I've been thinking about the Force Multiplier backpack for the Perfect Combined Arms because that is an easy trigger for 30% skill damage. For the chest, I'm not so sure which talent is really supporting a skill build. Since I don't get anything better, at the moment I'm using Tamper Proof to protect my turret. If the game tends to drop it for me, I'd like to use Skilled or Spark.  Spotter could be useful too. Skilled, I don't know if this really does the trick. My turret is down to &lt;9s and the drone &lt;20s. Spark would be good, to get at least some weapon damage. Spotter in the same way, with the upside to increase skill and weapon damage and the downside of the need to spot enemies, like marking them with the technician laser. Other than that, is there anything useful?

* skills

I learned the sniper turret is pretty powerful and works quite good combined with Spotter, since I need to aim to assign a target, but what is the best company. So far I used the stinger hive and/or the striker drone. But both of them do not feel that powerful as I would expect that for tier 6 skills. Is there something more useful/powerful out there?

The weapons I use are the Send Off for the Perfect Rooted and a M4 with Spike.

I would really appreciate the help here a bit, since I really don't like the all red builds that much. I sadly remember the Tactitian times.....",21,1584957551,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnhfmh/skill_build_questions/,thedivision,1

Finally after grinding for so much time, luck rewarded me. I was beyond excited, but when I picked it up and saw the stats/rolls... My heart was crushed!

It was disappointing, a kick in the balls, a disastrous reminder of how broken this game is. It was so disheartening that I didn’t even want to  play the game. How many runs or how many hours had I put into finding this exotic? Countless. 

After all that work I was finally rewarded with my exquisite price, only to found out it wasn’t worth a dime. 

This has to change, NOW! The player base is putting unimaginable amounts of effort and time into finding the rarest of equipment, only for it to be complete trash! 

I’m not against the grind, the work or the LUCK but for the culmination of all of those factors to reward us with nothing, that’s outrageous. 

Exotics should all be god rolled. They’re supposed to be the rarest but best items to possess. 

This game has enough RNG. Everything is RNG. Can we possibly not have to worry about our exotics being straight garbage? 

There’s so many layers of RNG in the game now that it’s taking the fun out of it. I can deal with bad rolls on high-ends, purples etc. But not on exotics, please.

What I suggest is that they should be maxed out by default or at least they should drop with 1 or 2 maxed out attributes. In the worst case scenario, they should come with more than 70% of the attributes max stat. Imagine doing legendary missions over and over and over and when you finally drop the Big Horn, it's trash!

fng03w,RabbitKiller35,The real reason why bullet sponge only option + my semi-solution(Neva gun appen),"Yes, I hate it too. It boring as all hell. 

Perhaps it's been covered here before but I'll give my opinion nonetheless.

The NPCs are not varied enough to allow for creating difficulty through any other means outside of toughness and insta-kills.

Compare the NPCs in TD to NPCs in other looter-shooter type games. Dogos  aside, there is just no real variety. 

You fight all the NPCs the same way - headshots or weakpoint and then headshot. 

Massive painted themselves into a corner with their NPC design and its partly because of the real world setting of the game. The other part is down to them not being able to figure out how to vary NPC attacks and strategies within a real world setting, to increase difficulty, without concurrently increasing boredom/annoyance.

They also appear to be limited by hardware in terms of not being able to spawn more enemies on missions/maps in order to increase difficulty that way.

It seems that there is some consensus around people approving more of killing 20 enemies in one minute than 1 enemy in two minutes. And its potentially the current gen consoles which rule this out as an option.

So where to?

Well, my guess would be that they need to provide enemies with more creative attacks/abilities/defence, aimed at disrupting, slowing, disarming and generally making it difficult for you to kill them while not having ten billion armor.

In reality, they have, in the past, not been creative enough to do so and will likely not find that creativity any time soon.

There ""fix"" will be a case of simply adjusting global NPC values. 

My solution to the problem would have been to create 10-15 unique boss-like NPCs for each faction. Each with their own type of attacks and each requiring a different approach in order to down. Populate the world and missions with small groups of those and mix it in with a few complimentary NPCs. 

In that type of system you could draw out the value of different skills, weapons, synergies, etc. Fights would require more strategy and be more engaging. 

EGs 
-A tank type enemy that moves slowly but can only take damage to his back and from within 5m.  
-A CC/Sniper type enemy that will always stun the two closest agents and keep them frozen until he is downed. 
-An enemy that deflects all damage unless he is CCd.
-An assassin type enemy with no radar presence, name plate or healthbar which actively tries to sneak up on your team, rogues?
-A duo where only one be damage at a time and if you damage the wrong one it heals the other one. Once one is down you have limited time to kill the last one or else he revives his pal.
-An explosive runner that once you shoot him can be directed towards other NPCs if you shoot those NPCs within a second or two after shooting him. To kill him you need to direct him into a gas canister.
- An enemy that can only be killed using sidearms. 

Those are just some bad examples of ways to makes fights more interesting/satisfying and while requiring you to understand NPC mechanics in order to succeed. 

In my experience, players enjoy learning mechanics as their is a sense of accomplishment and progression involved. It sits outside of how good your gear is since your gear strength means nothing if you don't know what to do. 

As you run through the world you will constantly be faced with different challenges that require wildly varying approaches. 

Right now, a handful of encounters aside, the game entirely ignores this potentially very rich vein of progression.

Now, if I can come up with those, off the cuff, surely paid professionals should be able to do better.

No?

2pc Bonus: +15% Radius

3pc Bonus: +15% stim efficiency, +10% armor repair (for their respective variants)

4pc Bonus: the Hive may now use Booster and Restorer variants at the same time. Booster and Restorer will alternate every other charge

Backpack Talent, *Fight Forever*: Charges have a 5% chance of not being consumed. 

Chest Talent, *Overdrive*: each charge has a 7% chance of being both a Restorer and Booster charge. 

This 2.0 Gear Set, much like the first one, would revolve heavily around PvE teamplay. Each piece will roll with Skill Tier along with Defensive and/or skill minor attributes.

fnflqo,MLG_Taco_Trash,My thoughts on the current state of exotics.,"To be honest I don’t think the rolls or rates for exotics are the problem, it’s their utility. Look at the ninja bike knee pads, you reload your current weapon by vaulting, awesome sounds good for a run and gun play style but that style of play isn’t viable in this meta, pve or pvp. You will get nuked by a player with a bakers dozen before the animation is over or someone sitting in cover with a MG5 who will mow you down before the animation is over, and in PVE a hyena red bar wearing a tank top on challenging can easily hit you for a million damage with no trouble. Exotics were put into a category like gear sets, you have to build around them and their one talent otherwise they feel very weak. This system pigeonholes players into specific play types that don’t feel viable, the chameleon is another exotic that suffers from this. In order to use a chameleon you have to spec into pure crit hit chance and damage along with as much weapon damage as you can muster and even then it feels weaker then the Glory Daze until you get its crit buff and damage buff but that takes 90 shots to get their where the Glory Daze is already at that high damage ceiling from the jump with no recoil. Named Items are more viable then exotics and that fucking crazy, my Lady Death sits in my box or on my wall because I can’t take advantage of its buff without getting nuked even with intimidate and bloodsucker. Exotics should have been left where they were and the only weapons with 3 talents (2 in the case of the chameleon) now they feel so on par with named items that I think the devs balanced them in this way to not give the more hardcore players a advantage of over the more casual ones.",6,1584946681,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnflqo/my_thoughts_on_the_current_state_of_exotics/,thedivision,1

fnfh5y,Pizzamorg,Working on a Fire based CC build for PVE.,"I've seen some other people posting build threads in response to people thinking all you can make are red stacks, so here is my answer. I'd be interested to get your opinion on this. I'm not really sure how good this build actually is, it is certainly non meta and niche, but I've been focusing on crafting this and it is giving me a lot of enjoyment all the same.  

The objective with this build is crowd control, through setting everybody on fire, with as much of a focus of disabling enemies (due to the panic of being on fire) and also trying to do a good chunk of damage in the process, without necessarily stacking reds. 

Skills to use: you have a fair amount of options here, which is nice. I eventually settled on the Firestarter Chem Launcher and the incendiary sticky launcher. I was running the airburst seeker mine for a while, but I just seemed to miss over and over. 

Specialisation: You have two options here, you can go Firewall for the perk that allows fire to burn that much longer or Survivalist for the fire grenades and the perk that means everyone is doing more damage to your ignited enemies. Plus with Survivalist you get bleed on the signature weapon, which while not far, wraps into the focus of the build all the same.   

Gear: I would say focus on skill tiers and status effects, basically. I use a Golan Gear mask with plus 10% status effects as the brand bonus. I was running Firm Handshake with The Grudge for a while, I now have swapped out The Grudge for Pyromaniac but left the gloves on for that extra bit of status effect percentage. My exotic centrepiece is of course Imperial Dynasty. Everything else has just been tossed in due to having high status effect rolls on them and I've put four pieces with a skill tier core, to give yourself much stronger fire starting skills.   

For my chest talent I have thrown Unbreakable onto it, this doesn't really add into the build's focus I appreciate, but the build can be quite squishy and having those second chances on higher difficulties is just nice. Once the game is retuned, you could swap this for something more focused within the build itself. 

For backpack you can either go creeping death or wicked (or perfectly wicked if you can get the named backpack to drop). I eventually settled on creeping death, as it helps me save one of my skills or grenades if Dynasty procs as enemies are coming out of a spawn closet, setting them all on fire anyway. 

Weapons, again, are fairly open. You have that named rifle with offers perfect Perpetuation, you have The Grudge with Perfect Vindictive and then you have Pyromaniac. I eventually settled on Pyro as its an extra ignited enemy, plus you're dealing 25 percent more damage to all of the enemies you set on fire. The downsides for Perp and Grudge for me, is that hit detection sucks on PC so headshots don't always register and for Grudge's perk to proc your bullet has to be the last one that hits the enemy before they die and it's just real frustrating. 

I guess technically you could run two of these weapons, but I have a perfectly rolled Bakers Dozen, so I tend to use that and then just mow down my hordes of burning enemies from afar. Up to you.  

So how does it all work? 

I mean it is fairly simple, as you could probably gleam from the description. See enemies coming out of a spawn closet, wait for Imperial and Creeping to proc, if they are on cooldown, launch your Chem or Sticky into that crowd and watch the world burn. 

I know our fire damage isn't as great as NPCs, but the bonus really is more about the panic it causes, taking some of the pressure off of you as enemies are not shooting you and the fire does a pretty good job of ticking off the enemies armour, to leave them open to be melted by everyone's guns. Plus, if you are running Survivalist, everyone is doing bonus damage. 

Running at four skill tiers, the cool down on my sticky really isn't very long and using a mod, I have six shots in my Launcher with a fairly quick cooldown, plus Dynasty and Pyro and if I'm running Survivalist fire grenades as well so there is really maximum up time of enemies on fire always. 

The build also, in my experience, synergises with almost any random build you might run into while matchmaking because of its multi fold benefits. The build is I guess pretty niche, but not so niche that it needs the stars to align to be useful.  

Even running solo, I feel this build runs really well. Yeah, you aren't necessarily doing as much focused damage as you might be doing otherwise, but the build should stop you getting overwhelmed and you're doing constant damage over time, to eventually wear down the enemies and swing the battle in your favour. You run a straight DPS build solo and there is little stopping you from just drowning in all of the enemy damage. 

So, yeah, still a work in progress but I'd be interested to get your thoughts.",14,1584945948,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnfh5y/working_on_a_fire_based_cc_build_for_pve/,thedivision,1

fneld7,mollymcwigglebum,MOLLY's MAD BUILDS - The Trapper - TU8,"  

So, one of the things I have noticed a lot on this sub is that there is a veritable din of complaints around the difficulty of NPC's and the game in general when in groups. This has led to a whole host of ""Git gud"" posts and folks generally accepting that build diversity is gone and maximum DPS is the only thing that matters.

Firstly, I would like to say this, I respectfully do not agree with consensus at large that the game is too difficult and that build diversity is gone. My reasons for this are simply because that has not been my experience to date. However, I will confess that I have personally not done enough as a community member to explain why and help those new and returning players that may be struggling to climb the difficulty curves in this game.

With that said I thought, I thought I might revive a series of build posts I used to make in order to do just that.

**DISCLAIMER:** The builds I present generally are off meta builds with specific purpose, functionality and or play style. Whilst I don’t do video (text-based guides are my thing), all the builds I present are builds I do have and use in the way described.

**Note on rolls**: with gear 2.0 in TU8 and how there are obvious max rolls for all attributes, rather than provide the stat % required on a piece of gear in the guide I will simply tell you what attribute works best and why. This serves to save time and allow folks with all quality levels of gear to piece together the build.

With there will be descriptions around skill timers, or damage numbers etc. To make things simpler these are always taken straight from my build and will vary slightly from yours due to varying rolls.

# THE TRAPPER

**Objective:** As mentioned earlier I disagree with the consensus that build diversity is gone. Rather than debate the point online, I challenged myself to create a build that would be as off meta as possible, ZERO DPS, but also provide a squad with invaluable support. And so, THE TRAPPER was born.

**Role:** The clue for this one is in the name funnily enough. The role of the Trapper is basically crowd control… CC lock the enemy permanently so the rest of the squad can destroy them

**Skills to use:** Shock Trap / Ensnare Chem Launcher

**Specialization:** Survivalist (This is explained later)

**Gear:**

1 x Acosta Go Bag

1 x Murakami

1 x Hana U

3x Wyvern Wear

Aside from the backpack you can have the brands in any position you wish, I personally have a Murakami chest, Hana-U Holster and then Gloves, Knees and Mask as Wyvern Wear

**Chest Talent:** 

*Mad Bomber* \- Grenades have 50% more radius and can be cooked, grenades that kill are refunded.

**Backpack Talent:** 

*One in the hand* \- Damaging an enemy with a grenade grants +1 skill tier for 15 seconds. Grants overcharge if already at skill tier 6. Cool-down is 60 seconds.

*Two in the bag: -* \+1 Armor Kit Capacity, +3 Grenade Capacity, +25% Ammo Capacity, +10% Skill Repair and +10% Status Effects

**Weapon Talent:** *Perpetuation* (Head-shots grant 50% status effect duration to the next skill used)

**Attributes to pursue**: Status Effect, this increases the time a status effect lasts  / Skill haste, how quickly your skills come back.

Currently on my build I have 105% skill haste and 47.7% Status effect (This includes brand bonuses), I would like to get more status effects if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

# HOW DOES THE BUILD WORK?

This build seems odd at first because it does next to zero damage, but once you see the enemy stuck in your traps and never able to move you will see how valuable a build like this can be.

Firstly, the build is based around triggering the overcharge on skills with the Acosta’s go bag *One in the Hand* talent. Now throwing grenades on Heroic level difficulty is nothing but frustrating because the AI avoids them like green poison and they can roll for days, to get around this we take *Mad Bomber* on the chest piece to increase grenade radius and then we take the Survivalist specialization to access flame grenades. These grenades have a higher base radius that all other grenades besides blind and when coupled with Mad Bomber landing a cooked grenade at the enemy’s feet guarantees that you will hit them with it.

Once you have opened with a flamed grenade and applied a status effect you have now triggered overcharge on your skills, at this point you want to quick get a single head-shot (not a kill) to trigger *Perpetuation* and then throw out your shock trap to encompass as many enemies as possible. You will have a huge radius on it more than enough to capture most enemies at once in most rooms on most missions. Once deployed all enemies shocked will remain so for a minimum of 22 secs but with high status effect rolls on gear and with *Perpetuation* active you can get this up over 30 secs.

Now this is where things get very cool. The survivalist specialization grants all allies +10% damage to enemies under status effect, they also have a full 22 – 30 secs or so to basically burst down the enemy without fear of reprisal. If your team has DPS covered properly this should be no problem at all on challenge, however on Heroic and Legendary, the enemy can take a bit of beating to say the least. So, your next step is to get another head-shot to trigger Perpetuation again after its 20sec cool down is over, you then use the ensnare launcher to catch up anyone coming off shock and lock them in place for another 20+ secs.

Once this cycle has been complete the cool down on One in the hand should be about done and ready to use again. When it comes of cool-down, throw that grenade, trigger overcharge and because your shock trap should have come back again, throw it out and shock everyone to their core again.

Now depending on how much skill haste and status affects you have stacked from attributes and mods, you will need to play around with the timing between the use of skills, getting head shots and throwing grenades but provided that you have Mad Bomber, Acosta’s Go bag and the survivalist specialization with 6 Tier skill you can make this build work.

I hope you have enjoyed this build guide agents. Next up I will pair this up with a synergized DPS build!

&amp;#x200B;

**Special note:** I feel that it should be obvious but this is not a solo build, however there could be a case made for switching the launcher over to a burn or oxidizer one when trying to use it solo. But I haven't tested it that way so I am not certain.",54,1584941099,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fneld7/mollys_mad_builds_the_trapper_tu8/,thedivision,1

It's too late to change that now. I just wish they hadn't placed in the level 30 boost for new players. grinds my gears when I see a level 100+ player with a commendation score of 100 or less...

With the amount of blueprints constantly increasing, it’s become ridiculously difficult to acquire certain blueprints. There’s over 200+ blueprints and a very limited amount of CPs and weekly projects, this makes the RNG behind them irritating. 

I’ve been doing CPs and my weekly projects for weeks now in hope of acquiring certain mods but it’s driving me nuts, I can’t seem to get my hands on the ones I need. It’s frustrating and tiring. 

Don’t you guys think that there’s enough RNG in this game? Do we really need it behind blueprints?

fncxj3,evascale,"Catching up with the game, need some help","Last time I played this game was probably more than a year ago, I bought it when it was first released and played it until I reached maximum level (don't recall what the max level was) and after reaching max level I kept levelling in term of equipment which means gear score. I remember reaching the maximum that I can reach at that point (think it was 350 or something) and then quitting because there wasn't anything left to do.

Today, I wanted to check this game out and it all felt so different. I didn't even know how to use my gadgets and stuff, and game kept throwing new notifications at me for every single thing I missed in that time, but I can't say I understood much of it. I remember before releasing the game, developers made a claim that every content that is added later to this game would be free to everyone and the only difference between the ones who pay and buy it that it would be accessible 2 weeks later. Did ubisoft follow their word on that or do I have to buy the new Warlords of NY DLC in order to get some more content now?

Also, can you guys fill me up on the recent major changes? I remember having a gear that is mostly red (which means raw gun power and less reliant on the skills) but I'm sure many things have changed by now, and I don't even know what kind of a build I have now.

Running through the mission with the glitch on and then killing him takes around 2 mins (around 1 min and 33 seconds average for me).   


Do not comment on this with stuff like ""Don't exploit the glitch"" and so on. I will ignore these and will continue to abuse stuff like that until the loot is finally worth the time and effort I put into the game.

fnckw6,J107wbct,Some smaller bugs or glitches that some may not know about. (PS4),"
These are all bugs that I've encountered in my last play session. First off is the area where you get the Constitution of the United States. It's near a water resource node and it's directly south of the District Union Arena mission. When you go to the zone, there are 2 ropes. Those ropes cannot be used. Nothing works. You aren't able to get the collectible.
Secondly, and this one might be more common, is the Angel Of Mercy contaminated zone, which still is inaccessible for a lot of players. There are 2 pipes you should be able to climb up on and you cannot. The button doesn't even show up. And this is a yellow painted zone that would normally tell you that you can climb this thing. So those collectibles and the related Commendation are locked out for that area.
Lastly is a proc with Unbreakable, or lack thereof. When my armor is broken, more than half the time Unbreakable does not trigger, and this is well after the 60 second cooldown. I relogged for all of the above glitches and bugs.

I'm on the side of RNG being a factor, but hell, I believe they should have a minimum roll that is ***at bare minimum*** 1% higher than the max roll of a high-end. It is an exotic in an rng looter shooter, after all. They ***should*** be considerably more powerful.

Gear rolls should be something like 175,000 armor minimum to 200,000 max, +2 Skill Tier, 16%-23% Weapon damage etc.. It's not like an extra 8% weapon damage is going to break the game anymore than it already is, but gives a sense of not being completely devastated by seeing complete garbage rolls.

RNG is still a factor, but at least you know when that exotic drops, it's not straight trash or a stash guardian.",7,1584928021,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnbpli/my_suggestion_on_an_exotic_rework/,thedivision,1

fnb1jb,Dxurd,Exotic / Named RNG Rework," Every mission / activity completed in the game, should reward gear specific exotic tokens corresponding to the possible exotic gear drops for the activity (e.g. completing a legendary mission will reward say, 5 exotic tokens for the Big Horn, completing a heroic Rikers mission will reward 5 exotic tokens for the Bullet King).

The number of tokens dropped will scale to the difficulty and type of activity in LZ / DZ. Drops of these tokens will be guaranteed and not affiliated with RNG as much as possible when playing Challenge and above. (So if you complete a True Sons mission with target loot for rifles, you will instead receive half of the normal amount of tokens for Merciless and the other half for Tardigrade). There will be exceptions to this, e.g. Acosta’s Go-Bag, which will have corresponding tokens dropped at a flat amount from each faction chest opened regardless of difficulty.

A new vendor will be added to the base of operations where players can choose to exchange the tokens obtained for the respective exotics. This vendor will allow exchanges for all available in game exotic gear and will have no down time (unlike Cassie). The exchanges for an exotic can be performed at various token costs. A higher number of tokens spent for an exchange means higher stats rolls for the exotic received. For example, in terms of stats, spending 50 tokens will grant an exotic with similar rolls to what an average drop would have been playing in normal and spending 100 tokens will grant one with similar rolls to what an average drop would have been playing in challenging (so \~+25 extra tokens per difficulty, up to 125 for Heroic). However, there will be an option to spend (say) 150 tokens to guarantee an exotic with all stats maxed.

In future events, event themed exotics will have their token drop quantities increased or have unique drop sources (e.g. only available from manhunt targets / reaching certain stages of various leagues) before being added to the common loot pool. Some of the exotic will eventually have their tokens generalized / combined. (if the game lives long enough to have that many different exotics.)

(Not my suggestion, but direly needed) Additionally, any exotic’s attributes can be recalibrated (still only once) using exotic components obtained from dismantling excess exotic gears. But the amount of components received from dismantling an exotic will NOT scale with its stats. (So exchanging for an exotic at 50 tokens and dismantling will yield the same amount of components as dismantling an exotic exchanged for with 100 tokens.)

As a trade off for the above changes, chance of exotic drops will be decreased across the board (but the chances will still be non-zero. Although personally, I won’t mind zero if the above system is in place).

Named gear will no longer have Light Zone / Dark Zone exclusivity and will instead be divided into 2 loot pools. For each week, one pool will drop exclusively for the Light Zone and the other exclusively for the Dark Zone. At the end of each week, the two pools will exchange their zones. So what was available only in the Light Zone the previous week, is now available in the Dark Zone and vice versa.

Dismantling any named gear will drop an additional material, the Named Gear Insignia. These Insignias will NOT be gear specific but, can be spent in a way similar to the above at the new vendor. The selection of named items available for exchange will however rotate weekly. The selection will be somewhat random (but not completely). The vendor must cycle through every item available in both Named loot pools before it is allowed to repeat an item, which is when a new cycle effectively starts.",1,1584925290,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fnb1jb/exotic_named_rng_rework/,thedivision,1
fnb17t,left_narwhal,PSA: Do not use your Reviver Hive for your teammates (this bugs your revive),"The Reviver Hive is a staple of solo play and a good utility option for dps players. One of its biggest benefit is reviving downed or dead teammates during combat and it only uses 1 charge per person. The Reviver works faster than manual especially for dead teammates and keeps the user from being exposed. However, from my experience, I've found that whenever I used the Reviver on an ally, afterwards, if I am down, they will not be able to manually revive me. I can only be revived through another Reviver Hive or from respawning. So for the time being use caution when you use the Hive to revive someone else because it basically makes your death permanent for the fight.

fnaqa9,fedairkid,Contractor's Gloves and Fox's Prayers should change Brand sets,"They are by far the best choice for a dps build in their slots. I'm personally fine with that, but I do not quite understand why they are in Brand sets that give weapon-type specific damage. There are other reasons why LMGs and Rifles are the meta right now, but as long as the two best dps gear pieces give damage to those two weapon types, using other weapons is simply sub-optimal. So unless LMGs and RIfles, or Fox's Prayers and Contractor's get nerfed hard enough to not be best in slot anymore (which I am not asking for), the best dps builds will run either an LMG or a Rifle, most likely both, since you'd be wasting two Attributes otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

I am honestly a bit puzzled why they were put in these brand sets. Massive must have known that they would be the best option for dps, do they want to push LMGs and Rifles? I get that the stats fit the weapons thematically, but it hinders build diversity as far as min/maxing is concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

I do realize that this is nitpicking, I am not claiming that this of any major importance, just something I wanted to address, because it honestly kinda puzzles me.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I would've liked to see them on a utility brand set like Richter&amp;Kaiser as a way to introduve some non-red stats into a dps build that they can still make use of. Or murakami to give a healing skill a bit more impact.

Or maybe DH, you always have a pistol on you, and stability is nice. Or at least on crit sets, since that is universal, though I personally think crit is already too prevalent.

&amp;#x200B;

Or maybe they should just get nerfed to not be best ins lot anymore unless you ARE using their respective weapon types.

**Main Core Type:** 3 red (providence holster gloves and knees), 2 blue (gila mask, badger chest), 1 yellow (murakami backpack)

**Secondary stats:** Crit mainly.

**Exotics:** Don't have much exotics atm, gotta try Pestilence when I drop it

**Gear:** Providence are full red, Badger chest is ""Zero F's"" (Perfectly Unbreakable) for -oh s\*\*\*- moments and Murakami backpack is Bloodsucker

**Weapons:** An LMG I guess but I don't really know. 

**Skills:** Banshee (crucial for the build)

**Specialisation:** Gunner

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, do keep in mind this is the starter version (and could be trash as well).

So I engage with banshee for CC. Chaining kills with Bloodsucker can get my armor to 20 bars, allowing me to leave cover more often and just shoot at stuff while sponging/aggro'ing damage. Once my Gunner minigun is out I can just destroy everything without dying, that felt satisfying

I wondered if I could add something to have in-fight armor regen or if  I should use a certain type of weapon/gear.

Have any of you guys seen/used a similar build? Is it too dangerous to carry late-game?

fn92u9,throwawayissafer,I'm loving the new NPC experience expansion,"You too can now one-shot your enemies no matter how poor your gear is. Gone are the days of grinding out a perfect build so you can do take down sponges and waves of enemies ever so slightly faster while also living ever so slightly longer. Feel like a red Hyena and obliterate a highly trained elite soldier within the fraction of a second. 


But jokes aside you might say this exploit allows players to equalize the playing field a little bit. I'd even say the damage exploit is one of the best things to happen to this game. It shows the underlying issues in the relationship between devs and players. Since the first game the devs did everything they could to make the experience as miserable as possible for players, to make things as unrewarding as possible. The main reason so many people jump on this exploit is how unfair this game feels to even the best players who have grinded thousands of hours in the game. Just watch streams if you don't believe me. If even the best among the best realize how horribly flawed the balance is imagine how your average Joe gamer must feel. This is a way for the average player to get some payback. To experience the power fantasy they are so desperately trying to build for. And now even they get to see that no matter how good you are, no matter how good your build is: It. Does. Not. Matter. Even playing a Legendary mission will result in horrible loot. We are grinding for nothing. This is the same reason they purposely avoided giving us upgrade blueprints for the level 30 exotics, or having them now roll like any other piece of loot (max rolls almost don't exist).


The worst part for Massive in this isn't players nuking leaderboards or going as far as using the exploit in the DZ. It's their model yet again getting exposed for being a farce. You were so worried about your game dying from being too easy that you forgot all about making it possible to get rewarded, to make players feel like they are working for something that is worth it.",19,1584917787,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn92u9/im_loving_the_new_npc_experience_expansion/,thedivision,1

Just a short montage of some NPC [craziness](https://youtu.be/fdOyQC-UxYA).

1. NPCs and their silly flanking strats while ignoring fire status effects from overcharged chem fire ticking for 300k+ damage.
2. NPC healing through multiple 1.1m damage hive hits plus 30k bleed ticks, multiple 500k chem fire explosions plus ticking for 260k, and multiple 160k rifle hits.
3. NPC melting 2.8m HP drone in seconds.
4. NPC fire damage bullets wrecking 700k hp in 2 seconds.
5. Insane range on an NPC riot foam fire bomb.

I love a good challenge. I'm usually playing on heroic solo now that my skill build has improved. The mechanics that we're supposed to call challenging after WONY is more cheese than challenge! It's been stated plenty in the division feeds so I won't repeat everything, but come on Massive. You've gotta give us some more real fair challenges in this game and get rid of these cheese mechanics and calling it difficulty! I can only imagine how good this game would actually be if the people in the bug testing and NPC/combat design department where as thorough as the graphics/environment department! Not to mention they're already talking about increasing the health of heroic NPCs once they adjust NPC damage! A good challenge isn't just more health, more damage, and laser aim. 

Either way, I'm not gonna stop playing. I know they'll fix it eventually. I got faith they'll get it together.

I'm not mad at all I'm just really concerned because this doesn't seem to be a top priority and you seem unaware how much this impacts us all. Especially NY which I would love to play around in more but currently can't as there is NOTHING. So please let us know you're working hard on this.

fn75ph,JokerUnique,This Week in The Division 2,"#This Week in The Division 2 - March 20

[Season 1 – Shadow Tide](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/5WgTxXw9Ttcl6hrLmnY3Nr/season-1-shadow-tide-live-now) is in full swing for The Division 2 Warlords of New York with the launch of Westside League, a series of challenges and progression levels featuring time trials, high difficulty missions, and unique enemy eliminations. Leagues are meant to test your skills, so be prepared when jumping in for the first time. You can participate in the Leagues either solo or in a group, using the game’s existing group/matchmaking system.

&amp;nbsp;

The Westside League is open for two weeks, overlapping with next week’s Polarity Switch Global Event, so make sure you give it a try before it closes. Don’t worry if you miss it, as there will be plenty of other Leagues focusing on different factions, missions, and challenges throughout Season 1. Westside League offers players 10 additional rewards, including two unique cosmetic items and an exotic cache. Make sure you log in between now and March 30th in order to claim your New Era 9FORTY cap in-game apparel item in celebration of our partnership with New Era Europe. You can sign-up to the New Era [newsletter](https://www.pages03.net/neweracapcompanyltd/Social-Media) to be notified when the real-life version becomes available for purchase.

&amp;nbsp;

The Division 2 is now available on Stadia, the new generation gaming platform from Google! Stadia features cross-progression and cross-play between Stadia and PC, meaning that players on both platforms can play with each other as well as carry over character progress between the two if they own the game on both platforms. Additionally, Stadia includes a new multiplayer function, Stream Connect. This allows you to see a small sample of all your group-mates’ gameplay screens live as you play.

&amp;nbsp;

***
##**Priority Alerts:**

Our maintenance earlier this week covered the following issues:

*   We are temporarily disabling the ability to reset seasonal manhunts in order to prevent lost progression towards a manhunt until a more permanent improved solution is ready to deploy.
*   Fixed a progression blocker where an NPC became stuck at the last stage in Castle Clinton.
*   Correct the Specialization Points gained on SHD Level up from 1 to 3.
*   Fixed an issue where blue quality items dropped from regular NPCs in the DZ regardless of player level.
*   Fixed an issue where players would gain multiple seasonal caches.
*   Fixed an issue with seasonal cache rewards becoming contaminated if players leveled whilst in the DZ.
*   Fixed an issue that prevented players from gaining seasonal XP from DZ activities.
*   Fixed several issues preventing capture completion of The Nest Control Point.
*   Fixed an issue that would cause some NPCs to be stuck at spawn in various Control Points.
*   Fixed some puzzle reset issues on all Hunter encounters.
*   Fixed an issue causing Hunter encounters to give too many keys.
    *   If you received too many keys, you won’t receive new keys until your completed encounters match your number of keys.

&amp;nbsp;

We also have several significant tweaks coming to multiple difficulties across both the endgame and the World Tier 1-5 content. The next update will:

*   **Reduce NPC Damage output for all difficulties.**
    *   This applies to all NPCs and activities and enemies will do less damage to players compared to their current damage output.
*   **Reduce NPC Health and Amor for group scaling.**
    *   Enemy Health and Armor scaling for 2-, 3- and 4-player groups based on Veterancy.
    *   This means Red, Veteran, Elite and Named enemies will have their Health and Armor reduced compared to their current values.
*   **Additionally, we are adjusting Health and Armor based on activity difficulty.**
    *   This applies to Hard and Challenging difficulties where enemies will have lower Health and Armor compared to their current values.
    *   An exception are Heroic and Legendary difficulty enemies which will have their Health and Armor **increased** to compensate for the group scaling reductions to their values.

&amp;nbsp;

We are also aware of and tracking several [priority issues](https://forums.ubisoft.com/showthread.php/2203030-Status-update-on-fixes-and-balancing). These are things we will be able to address later down the line as we are still investigating possible solutions:

*   Some Hive Skill variants are not receiving the Health and Range bonuses from Skill Tiers.
*   Low FPS in Dark Zone Extraction areas.
*   Fixing an issue causing players to not be able to progress to another World Tier after finishing the required Stronghold in a group and leaving the group after completing the Stronghold.
*   Fixing several separate issues causing NPCs to become stuck when the player is taking over enemy Control Points.
*   Fixing an issue causing players to be unable to exit the boat during the Liberty Island mission.
*   Fixing an issue causing players to be unable to re-do the Hunter puzzle encounters if they have failed the encounter before.
*   Fixing an issue causing the Specialization Weapons to not unlock when purchasing the Year 1 Pass or its variants.
*   Fixing an issue causing the Seeker Mine to sometimes not work properly.
*   Fixing and issue causing Season rewards to not be delivered when skipping a level.
*   Fixing issues causing some Bounty areas to have closed doors, blocking progress.
*   Fixing issues causing players to be unable to revive downed agents.

&amp;nbsp;

###**High Priority Issues:**

*   Talents and Gear Set bonuses not working.
*   Hit registration issues.
*   Season Ranks having been reset. Please be sure to send us videos or screenshots when applicable if you encounter any of these issues. We’ll be looking out for additional reports and details on our forums and across our social channels.

fn6n9i,stonedp1ngu,Group fast travelling...why?,"So if your in a group and a member fast travels to a DZ checkpoint the following happens.

A) You accept and travel with them.

B) You don't accept and travel with them.

C) You decline and get kicked from group.

Now these are the options everytime your prompted when Leader/Member fast travels to a now out of main map location.

A few things very frustrating with this you dont have to be leader to prompt this action. Without the ability to refuse fast travel and stay in group you leave the player with no real choice at all. I also don't understand why this is a thing at all, did we all lose the ability to fast travel ourselves around the world of Division 2?

This frustration all came about when a member in our group after 20mins of jumping around sorting out hunter secrets, pick ups and triggers decided to fast travel to the DZ. Noone in the group made a unified decision and two of us were kicked from group and went to DZ, the original group leader was moved back to their session and another group member went back to his instance. All progress was lost because at some point the session progression was because we couldn't choose an option that suited the situation.",7,1584909143,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn6n9i/group_fast_travellingwhy/,thedivision,1

Doesnt anyone know over there this will not make ANY customer happy? i bought the game for 3€ , cant complain about the value ratio of what i paid vs what i get , thing is if it wasnt for this scummy business model i would had already bought the expansion to show love and support to the devs (and have more content for myself) , but i wont , i refuse to do it , i will wait for it to be sold at 3€ too and then feel like im the one ripping you off , just feel sorry for all the devs hard work ruined by this very bad business decisions.",17,1584906242,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn5s9e/what_was_the_reasoning_to_implement_such_a_thing/,thedivision,1

fn5ajv,SleepyOne,Am I missing something? SHD Tech. Skills vs chests.,"As far as I know SHD Tech is a finite resource. 

As you use these to buy skills, it makes no sense to me that you can accidentally gimp a character permanently, by opening those chests before you have unlocked all your skills.

While leveling I did like so many others, see the chest, click it without really realizing it cost SHD tech to open. 

Luckily I had a few remaining so I could get the skills completed, but a few people I know were not so lucky. They had opened multiple of these chests without realizing. 

I totally understand the argument ""you should pay more attention"" etc, but to permanently gimp a character because some people don't pay attention while opening chests doesn't seem like a very good idea?

Hopefully it's just me missing something here. Seems unreasonable for devs to make such an oversight. 

Maybe a warning before opening the chests? Or, not being able to open the chests at all before skills are unlocked?",8,1584904605,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn5ajv/am_i_missing_something_shd_tech_skills_vs_chests/,thedivision,1

Mission Results: https://i.redd.it/d62m3g3dd9o41.jpg

I cut it pretty close to the time limit but it was by no means a perfect run.

The key to beating the mission was because of Negotiator's Dilemma.

The 4 piece perk is that a critical hit on a marked enemy will deal damage to other marked enemies. The backpack talent is nice to increase damage on marked targets but the chest piece isn't that useful since the set is bugged. 

This helped speed things along, even though it's bugged and will only deal damage to one other marked enemy. With this I was able to mark multiple enemies, shoot at one that was easier to shoot, and deal damage to other enemies. 

This was especially handy against heavy units, I could mark a bunch of enemies and then while I deal with the heavy unit, the regular npcs were dropping like flies.

And of course this sped up the destruction of the tanks in the final stage since I could damage both tanks at once.

The boat was tricky but since the hatch was so spongy, I could mark npcs coming close to the boat and kill them by shooting the hatch which was hilarious. 

I got trapped on the boat though, this was the first time I was on it when it exploded. I nearly died from fire damage but luckily I was able to use the medkit just in time. 

Honestly, without the gear set I don't think I would have been able to solo the mission in time. The gas tanks and boat hatch are obnoxiously bullet spongy.",66,1584898486,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn3gow/how_to_solo_heroic_roosevelt_island_under_25/,thedivision,1

After playing TD2 for a while, I have to say, I'm rather turned off. It's just too unbalanced, I've been playing solo for the most part. On challenging and above difficulties even the trivial missions are too much hassle to be enjoyable. And it's not like I have low quality gear or anything. I've tried several types of builds by this point, it doesn't seem to make any difference. I don't mind a challenge. This is something different. When you're equipped in full gear-set items and can't even go toe-to-toe with veterans without them shredding your armor and leaving you hanging by the thread there's something wrong with the game. That wouldn't even be that big of a problem but while you were busy shooting it out with this guy, his buddies were flanking you and now you're out of position and with your pants down. Oh you wanna re-position, TFB because these motherfuckers never miss. At first I thought it was because I was too accustomed to playing with 6 piece classified gear sets, so I booted up the old game - Nope, while they make you a hell of a lot more tankier than whatever this shit is supposed to be, you're by no means invulnerable.

As it is, overcharge is a highly unreliable game mechanic - for example, if you placed your sniper turret down, you won't get the bonus from overcharge on the sniper turret.

If you are overcharged - your turret stays 'overcharged' despite saying its demoted back down to ST6 - this can be seen through the reload/recharge rate of the gun between shots.

fn2iip,Lord_Zerkcs,First Time Player - Finally Reached World Tier 5,"Hi All,

I joined this Sub a few weeks ago when Ubisoft had the discount for Division 2 before WONY dropped ( do plan to buy WONY Sorry in adavance for the poor Reddit posting ettiquite - I don't post often but I wanted to share my experience for other people on the fence of getting the game,and I feel I have a slightly different outlook then some posters on this reddit.

**TL:DR** at the bottom?

**It's Too Hard for Solo Players**

I am purely a solo player. From day one to world tier 5 and beyond I have been a Solo Player. There have been times I wanted to throw my keyboard and times I felt very underchallenged all in the same mission. If you're looking for a game that is not going to push your decision making skills then this isn't the game for you. You can spend 20 minutes on an encounter just to die because of a grenade lobbed across the map that has perfect precision on you. The one thing I will say is that you can get ganged up in the Dark Zones pretty quickly. I have had a mixed experience so far - but I enjoy the challenge so it just pushes me to want to train more because its not impossible. I read somewhere that the raid is possible to Solo however its a long...long...experience and I read counter information that it is impossible to solo (Can anyone clarify?)

**Loot System and Inventory Management**

The inventory management is terrible, it fills up quickly and if you're not paying attention you can quickly run out of space and then you're stuck dismantling things because you're not prepared. With that being said... it is grouped pretty well and you can mark things in advance. So with a little proper maintenance you can stay on top of it pretty easily.

On the flip side of this is the drop system. Coming from another loot grinder Destiny 2, the loot system is a little more confusing and less straight forward but the diversity in the abilities and skills is very refreshing. Being able to customize your play style to some very specific details has come in handy in the more challenging situations which required a little more help and abilities. Don't get lost in the abilities in my opinion until you start hitting the world tiers because it will become extremely overwhelming and confusion. Once you get close to the end game content I think it becomes a little more straight forward to the kind of play style which you prefer (for example: for me, I am a more tactical player then a agro player)

**Activities and Content**

The main story missions are fun. No doubt about it. I wouldn't say I was challenged but I definitely felt my palms get a little sweaty at times and I am the first to admit I died quite a bit in a few of the counters. When doing the storyline BEFORE advancing to World Tiers I enjoyed capturing control points but now it just becomes redundant but I guess it rewards good loot depending on how you want to approach it.

Adjusting to parkour style of play was also and adjustment for everyday play as I am coming from first person shooters like Destiny 2. However after getting adjusted, I definitely enjoy the ability to view third person and planning out a set of decisions or ideas and then trying to execute on it.

World Tiers are another animal and are not for a faint of heart just like the Dark Zones. Personally, I have nightmares of robo-hounds at night and I still am traumatized from my first invaded dark zone experience but still like to dip my toes in the water. At the final World Tier it definitely is time to bring out the big boy pants but I enjoy that feeling.

**TL:DR:::** Division 2 is fun and I enjoy the game, especially since I did not pay full price for the game. I am planning on getting Warlords of New York and excited for the content. Don't buy the same if you're not up for a challenge in the end-game content.",11,1584895110,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn2iip/first_time_player_finally_reached_world_tier_5/,thedivision,1

##Modifier

* **Onslaught** (Global Modifier)
   * Always active; Deal Burn, Bleed, and Gas effects to enemies in addition to normal damage. Reload to change the effect.
* **Savage Onslaught**
   * Onslaught behavior, enemies are vulnerable to one effect type and resistant to others. Agents take increased damage from resistant enemies.
* **Brutal Onslaught** (Group Modifier)
   * Savage Onslaught behavior, plus when two or more group members kill a vulnerable enemy within two seconds, each member can reload to gain a damage bonus for a single clip.

&amp;nbsp;

**Active Elemental Effect**

With the Global Modifier, you [always have one of three elemental effects active](https://i.imgur.com/FqIVGr0.png). You can have Burn, Bleed and Gas and depending on what is active, you do a different kind of elemental damage. You can switch the elemental effect by reloading your weapon. The Elemental Effects are weapon specific, so you can have different effects on each weapon.

&amp;nbsp;

**Elemental Effect Rotation**

When you reload your weapon, the elemental effects rotate always in the same order: [Burn](https://i.imgur.com/7yAtbzo.png), [Bleed](https://i.imgur.com/Aj4z6vS.png), and [Gas](https://i.imgur.com/68aB9to.png). Keep that in mind when you reload and when you have react to multiple enemies. Also keep different effects on both weapons, so that you can push the NPCs back.

&amp;nbsp;

**NPC Buff/Debuff**

When the second an third modifiers are active, each NPC is vulnerable to a specific set of Elemental Damage and resistant against others. When they are resistant, [the icon is greyed out](https://i.imgur.com/0Avru7o.png), you will do a lot less damage and they do a lot more damage to you. When the NPCs are vulnerable, the [icons are colored out](https://i.imgur.com/kJBR7Z7.png) and you can tear them down fast - even on legendary difficulty. 

The trick is, you have to [match the elemental effect on your agent, to the icon above the NPC](https://i.imgur.com/arxXUNW.png) - only, in this case, you do enough damage to tear them down before they kill you. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Brutal Onslaught - damage bonus AKA ""Smart Ammo""**

When two or more group members kill a vulnerable enemy within two seconds, each member can reload to gain a damage bonus for a single clip. That bonus is represented by a [skull](https://i.imgur.com/3IkwVkj.png) that appears next to your weapon. The bonus is weapon specific and will disappear as soon as you reload that weapon or the magazine is empty. As long as the bonus is active, [you can do damage against any NPC](https://i.imgur.com/IWMKe1a.png) and you are not limited to one element.

- what is a better stat to go for; accuracy or stability? 

- what stats should I be looking for on ongoing directive? I think it looks like a fun gear set so I’m trying to build it. 

-what’s the best way to rank up in the battle pass? I see you get coyotes mask in it and that seems like one of the best masks. Or is there a world drop location for it too?

fn1762,DarkRogueHunter,What do you think: Kind of scared to change my Global Difficulty!,"Morning Everyone, hope everyone is safe and healthy.

I know my title is a bit misleading, so I will give you all a bit of info.

When the Expansion came, I lost my heroic hybrid build I used, so I was trying to find my equilibrium with other builds. While finding the correct build, I stuck to Global Difficulty Hard for the time being. 

When Seasons dropped, I did the Neptune manhunt on hard, and completed it with much satisfaction 3 days in. Now days before the Leagues were to drop, I got a bit more comfortable with my build and switched to Global Difficulty Challenging, but when I did that it wiped my manhunt clean, back to square one. I panicked, and spent the last days of manhunt doing it again, though others said the first time counted. I didn't want to take that chance, so my Global Difficulty is set for now on hard. If I want to do Challenging or Heroic, I either do some activities to raise a CP or change the mission difficulty before grouping up.

I want to change my Global Difficulty to either Challenging or Heroic eventually, but I don't want to do Neptune for a 3rd time.  I may wait for now and change it when I finally get the EMP Sticky Launcher.",8,1584889584,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn1762/what_do_you_think_kind_of_scared_to_change_my/,thedivision,1

fn13ri,Warryk2,DPS Glitch Ruining Game,"I love looter shooters. And the division is the best one I’ve played. But the DPS glitch is ruining it and here’s why. 

Part of the looter shooter experience is working hard to get the gear so you can be better than other players. Otherwise why not just play a shooter like CoD. 

For a player who has legitimately beaten all legendaries, it’s a little disheartening to see so many people walking around with legendary outfit when you know they didn’t do it legit. The other night I ran 4 heroics with another guy and was questioning why he was doing so little dmg at the end. I inspected his build to make sure he wasn’t just a healer. I didn’t care at the time what he was running because I was zooming through it myself. But he wasn’t running a healer. And then I looked at his outfit and he had the legendary apparel on same as me and I got a little heated about it. That was before I knew of the first glitch. 

So I was happy this week when they finally patched the shield version of the glitch. Not too much damage had been done. But now I see there’s another one out there and it’s like a plague. The LFG feature is riddled with people posting for legendary and know how to glitch. That’s messed up. 

So for someone who can obtain the best gear the legit way, it’s ruining the game knowing these Glitchers have more of the best gear cuz they’re doing 8 minute runs on what should take a good team over an hour to do. 

Good job testing everything before you released the patch Massive. Buggiest/glitchiest patch yet. Don’t even get me started on PvP... 

Hate to say it, but at this point I almost want a reset of everyone back to 30, but that’s not happening. And to those who will respond with “if you can’t beat them, join them”, NOPE",31,1584889166,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fn13ri/dps_glitch_ruining_game/,thedivision,1

fn0sch,Goldkillswitch,The Division 2 is a mechanically sound game with an interesting setting and tone that is ruined by the Devs weaknesses when it comes to game design and code.,"Long-time player of both games. The world/theme is great. The cover/skill/shooting mechanics are very fun and feel very distinct from games like Destiny and Warframe. The game can look and sound beautiful and a lot of the endgame systems are (in theory) great.

What always hampers the Division is that Massive is bad at QA and bad at implementing the details of their game design. The first can be helped by more people and time in testing before changing/""fixing"" things. The second can be fixed by them realize they need more outside influence on their game design implementation, as they make bad decisions on their own. 

This can be fixed by at least a month of PTS on PC and Console followed by at least two months afterward to review comments and data, implement changes as needed, and TEST those changes appropriately. 

This will all take some time and money. They should have both after WONY.  But they need to make these changes now or the franchise will always limp along until Ubi moves on to the next shiny thing.

That would really suck, as the Division is very cool and I want it to get better. I know you do too.  I'm sure Massive does as well, but they need to wake up and fix their weaknesses instead of making the same mistakes year after year.

fn0mhf,Gudnamestaken,Tanky Questions (WoNY),"I quit playing shortly after episode 2 released, but I'm getting back into it with the new expansion. I'm working on finishing the firewall specialization and had some questions about tank builds (as much as they're possible in D2) and armor regen.

Both the Golan and Gila include a 1% armor regen, and while that seems quite small given how hard *everyone* hits, at 1.5mil+ armor, it's not insignificant. What's it set at though? I'm assuming it's 1% every second? And is it constant? Do you have to stay undamaged for a period of time, or does it keep regenerating all the time? 

I currently run protector on my backpack: when my shield is damaged the rest of the team gets a 15% armor bonus for 3 secs (3 second cd) and vanguard on my chest: when I deploy my shield it's invulnerable for 5 seconds, and my teammates get 45% of my armor for 20 seconds (25 second cd). I assume these skills are based around my base armor and not the armor value of my shield.

I primarily do missions and bounties and run with randos, and in the grand scheme of things, I wonder if these are worth it, given that I might as well be throwing whiffle balls at the enemy with this setup. I do have a very good Coyote mask, which I view as being my contribution to DPS (it makes my whiffle balls a little more deadly).

Prior to this expansion, it was a simple system of knowing how to get better weapons/ gear etc. 

But now, I don't see any difference in gear apart from the attributes. 

In say, normal difficulty, an assault rife will drop with X amount of damage. I raise the difficulty to Hard/ Challenging, and an assault rifle drops... with the same base damage.

How are people running around with weapons with an insane amount of base damage? How to raise this? Get better weapons/ armour?

I don't see why I have to struggle on challenging difficulty, when the loot that's dropping is just the same as the loot from lower difficulties?

So ultimately... how do you get new gear? I've also been trying out control points at level 4 to get some blueprints (as it says at the crafting station that I need to do these alert 4 control points), but no blueprints drop...

fmzrtc,True_Shot22,Crafting Costs and Materials Discussion,"One thing about the new update I noticed was a lot of positive comments regarding the new crafting system. However my crafting experience as a whole hasn't been going well at all.

Now don't get me wrong i've managed to complete my recalibration table except for one or two minor attributes on a few of the weapon types. I found this aspect of the crafting system a much welcomed addition. However, im talking about the crafting bench specifically and it's punishing costs when it comes to material usage. 

Crafting a single 'High End Item' doesn't require one or two materials, it requires at least 35 x 3 different resources plus a few thousand credits with each random roll produced. As soon as one material runs out the whole party stops. 

Repeatedly when making high ends though I will run out of steel. I have capped out all of the blue rarity materials (1500) and every other green material as well. I go to make a backpack and I need steel, I go to make a weapon and I need steel, i go to recalibrate a weapon....Steel. Ooh a project GIMME STEEL!

Yet I don't feel the urge to avoid meaningful content for two hours of looking for chests, only to rack up 150 steel and spend 80 donating to a project to then craft two Famas and be back at 0 steel. My friend finds himself running out of credits sooner than he can craft a weapon he likes but this could partially be blames on his deconstructing/selling habits. 

It made me wonder though, if im running out of steel and he is running out of credits are other agents running out of different things?  

If you have the time,

- How many items-ish are you crafting in a one night session of gaming?

- What material depletes the fastest for you?

- Which material is the hardest for you to acquire?

- Whats your opinion on the item crafting bench?

fmzqaq,PM_ME_YOUR_SUBLIGARS,Massive stance on exploits,"Going straight to the point:
Massive dropped the patch to try to fix the dmg exploit, but I still see people using dmg exploit and is not something that ""happens casually"", but my biggest issue is, what's going to happen with the people that used the exploit? 

What's your stance on this Massive? Are you going to allow your players to blatanly cheat at any given opportunity with no punishment? Are you going to look elsewhere so you don't have to take a decision about upsetting those players, even though in my honest opinion they deserve it?

No statement has been made by Massive about this as far as I know, no statement to me means that either you don't care people exploits your game, or you are more worried about upsetting those that exploited it than taking care of the playerbase that play fair and square.

I haven't beaten legendary, nor I will beat it soon most likely, but even not owning the black tusk outfit for beating legendary I feel immensely disappointed, people worked hard to get that outfit, people worked hard to get better loot, and then there's those who take shameless shortcuts at it.

And before people load up the excuses about the game being more fun with the exploit, please:
1. if you need an exploit to make the game fun for you, maybe you need to play something else. 
2. Don't use the previous excuse as a safeguard, you know that what you are doing is poor behaviour and you should be expected to get a punishment, regardless of lame excuses or not.

I will most likely get this post downvoted, but I needed to write this out.

Massive can we get a response about this? Whats the type of playerbase and behaviour you are going to allow in your game?",22,1584882630,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmzqaq/massive_stance_on_exploits/,thedivision,1

An endless mode that plays out differently every time? Yes please, why not. Why didn't you just replace the blizzard from Survival with a hurricane. Or sent us to Alaska and kept the blizzard. So many possibilities and less development time.

fmylsw,Ralfzer0,Exotic's rolls buffed?,"So basically, as i have said in the past, im totally fine with the game being as hard as it is right now. Although i think that something needs to be done wit the exotic rolls.

At the moment, i have completed more than 60 runs on Riker's missions (challenging 5% drop chance) just to get the Exotic lmg, havent got it yet, and im totally ok with that, what scares me the most is the possibility of actually getting it with shitty rolls. Which will basically mean that i will have to grind for god knows how long, in order to get a second one that might be as bad as the first one. 

I was a lucky boy and i got my 35 season pass level mask with pretty good rolls,  although im sure other people didnt.

Considering how hard it is to actually get an exotic (chances being very low), could we at least get the ability to recalibrate just one attribute?

Or maybe exotics drop with higher rolls than the average loot? I am not talking about god rolls, just a bit better than the average gear.

fmy123,LangleyHearse,"Amidst all of these issues, I've come to realize something","DZ is the way the game should be balanced in terms of enemy damage, armor scaling, and AI. I've been solo playing ODZ right now (this morning,) and I'm having a waaay better time than heroic on anything. It feels like my skills and damage are eons better than they are and even with the occasional crappy player murderfacing me, the time to kill on enemies is better or at least feels that way because I can move cover without massive one-shots, and the AI doesn't feel like it's just skipping through you and tanking bullets for days.

An enemy flanked me and shot at me and I had time to cover-to-cover to escape him, and properly position myself to kill him, I lost all of my armor and half my health--no one shot and mind you I have 828K armor on skill build, it's not a lot, but I have technician, so skill tier 6. I thought I'd just drop dead instantly, but I made it to better cover.

I admit to hating suicide drones to the earth of the earth, but not once did I flat out get murdered. Not once did I get one shot, no enemy besides a heavy felt like Spongebob and I realized that ODZ is 1000x better than the regular PVE world on heroic is. You can actually kill enemies and they can kill you. It feels more coherent than normal PVE does and I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this way about a""PVP enabled"" zone. I hate PVP usually.

I'll be staying in the ODZ to farm. I feel like my deaths are just my mistakes getting me knee-deep in shit, not broken NPCs one-shotting my soul out of my body and snorting the ashes.

I'm pretty expirienced in D2 ,all time playing in patriot tank build.
I think- Hey,i wanna try some shotgun dmg build.
And after 20 hours of trying like 8 builds i have some news for massive- there is no shotgun in game.
 
Best build ive got was tsunami build through intimidate - 160% weapon damage on shotgun with 57 crit chance. And with that stats you can't kill purple on challenge with one mag (8 shots).

fmx5f4,multiplechrometabs,Weapon and game balance,"It would seem that this game is balanced around normal and probably hard because I can never imagine anyone tackling a challenging or heroic mission with non auto or some semi automatic weapon. Using any shotgun or mmr is fun and very manageable in normal or hard but beyond that, it’s a pain. I’d also like to say that M1A cqb should not be that much weaker than the M1A classic and if it should be, why not give us the sturdy mag to compensate for lesser damage. I’d like to say that some skills are useless in higher difficulty.  Maybe I’m not optimizing my build well enough but I’d like to try to use a shotgun in heroic or legendary.

fmwc3d,Trzebiat,The purpose of ALL status effects should be putting players at disadvantage making them more vulnerable to be killed by enemies,"And status effects that don't deal damage achieve that perfectly, especially shock and ensnare. But due to ridiculous damage that comes with bleed, poison and especially burn (not to mention direct fire damage itself which is separate from status effect) - those status effects lost their main purpose. Does anyone still remember that being put on fire prevents you from aiming down sights? That was the main purpose of burn status effect in previous updates, forcing player to hip or blind fire while under burn status effect. But now? I'm more concerned and focused on staying alive and using armor kit or healing skill fast enough to not get killed by fire than enemies that might rush me while I'm not able to shoot them accurately.

**Suggestions**:

1. Drastically reduce burn, bleed and poison damage but increase the base duration of those status effects.
2. Make Hazard Protection to affect both status effects duration, duration of the temporary immunity after status effects end and the damage from status effects as well as from direct fire plus EMP and poison grenades that don't apply status effect but damage armor directly.
3. Make Hazard Protection and status effects resistances consistent when it comes to the point of full immunity. [Current immunity thresholds](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fkzvlz/tu8_changes_to_hazard_protection_and_status/) don't make sense just like in previous updates. 100% - full immunity to status effects and all hazard damage, 50% - duration and damage halved, temporary immunity increased by 50% (base temporary immunity duration is currently 2 seconds).",2,1584863802,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmwc3d/the_purpose_of_all_status_effects_should_be/,thedivision,1

fmw62k,Tennoz,Quality of life &amp; TD2,"There's always things about games that bother us and usually they get ironed out over time.  Much of the stuff that was wrong with TD1 has been fixed.  However, there's a few seemingly intentional aspects of the game that I believe are pointless and/or need an option for.  

In these games there's MANY pauses in menus and such that after a while become very annoying.  They take menu flow away from the game and make it feel more like that 5 second add before a video you have to watch before you can continue.  What exactly am I talking about?  Go level up your SHD watch.  Enjoy staring at your new minor stat increase for 5 seconds before it allows you out of the screen.  Go pickup some bounties, enjoy flipping through a few different screens only to be stuck looking at your targets then forced back to the map.  All of the repetitive reminders/tooltips/map unlocks are extremely annoying as well.  If you own the DLC and are 30 but not choosing to leave yet per your own reasons then every time you get to DC well.. ""HEY AGENT WE'RE READY TO LEAVE NOWWW!!!""  When you unlock anything on the map even if you've unlocked it in the past it still FORCES you to look at it for 15 seconds on the map, allow us to hit escape please.  Finally when you pickup a cellular device you're forced to listen to it, my friend and I ended up just turning off dialogue (which kind of cripples you in some ways) just so we didn't have to hear all the bloated dialogues.  

I know this was really much more of a rant and I'm sorry but I'm sure others out there feel the same way as my friend and myself which is why I was hoping options could be added to menus such as auto play cell devices when picked up or story tooltips off/on,  maybe even a speedy menus option.",5,1584862808,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmw62k/quality_of_life_td2/,thedivision,1

fmvnii,kmanmott,"I’m sorry agents, but a lot of you lack creativity, strategy and general common sense.","I’ve been seeing so much negativity around this game, around people’s experiences in game and how people are reacting to what’s going on for them. 

I want to squash what I feel like are a couple big complaints I’ve seen:

* Loot Quality
* Build Diversity 
* Difficult Content

## Complaint 1:Loot is Meaningless, and Terrible

I’m seeing so many posts and comments about how people are getting awful loot all the time. Complaints about purples, low tier high-ends and not being satisfied. 

I personally am finding it hard to believe people are having such a difficult time finding gears and rolls. My recal station was looking pretty stacked just through my gameplay of Hard global difficulty. I would only do Control Points at 3 and I power farmed activities throughout the open world. 

### *Are people trying too hard to do difficult content in hopes of better rolls?* 

Take my advise, go to hard, go to challenging. Knock out some CP3s, do all the activities as fast as you can. There’s no need for you to spend 45 minutes on a CP4 when you could have done 5 activities in the same amount of time. 

## Complaint 2: There no build diversity. 

You agents lack imagination, and you lack creativity. Everyone acts like there’s only 2 builds, and most of the comments are on the all red build. “All red” can have a lot of variation. Obviously there are always going to be best options - like the Fox’s Prayer. That doesn’t mean you can’t make a unique build. 

I personally am going to be making a Status Effect+80% build that’s either going to be full into CC chain, of full fire damage and double dipping into Skill Damage+%. 

### **Just like in Division 1, Crowd Control is king.**

This is going to lead me into my strategy point, but my god guys, no one runs crowd control in this game, Jesus half the people don’t even know how good Jammer Pulse is at disabling near everything. Please think creatively. Not everyone needs to go full red. 


## Complaint 3: This is bullshit, this enemy is OP, I spent 16 years trying to do this activity. 

It’s either you are looking for the challenge, or you’re too stupid to figure out you should have never done that level activity in the first place. 

*I’m going to take a short aside...*
I remember when I loaded up Bloodborne for the first time, and you start in Yharnham, and there’s this goddamn Executioner enemy they put in the very first level on the game. I must have died to this guy for like 4 hours straight, but when I beat him, I hollered out in joy. The enemy didn’t drop me anything, maybe 3 blood vials, bud I was simply excited I beat him. The funny thing is he wasn’t even necessary, he was more of an included difficultly. 

Anyways, if you’re not enjoying your time in the activity please don’t do it. If you’re getting tortured, having 0 fun, simply don’t load the freaking activity which is giving you a mild panic attack. Load up a lower global difficult, stomp some bad guys. Have some fun for fucks sake. If you want the challenge. Take it on. 

### Agents don’t know how to prioritize targets. 

I always see complaints about some Grenadier or some Outcast flamer or Outcast Molotov hitting someone and they’re complaining about it. 

You positioned poorly, you didn’t focus the enemy type you know specifically does that, you didn’t look for indicators that they’re going to do that. 

Some enemies are spammy, yes, but I’ll direct you back to my previous statement: **if you’re not having fun, don’t do it.** I had fun killing that Executioner...ONE single fucking enemy that wasn’t even a bloody boss in Bloodborne, you can have fun doing something you can succeed at as well. 

So, in truth I don’t want to call anyone out. I want people to get creative, people to find new builds, people to have fun playing a fun and engaging game.",64,1584859862,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmvnii/im_sorry_agents_but_a_lot_of_you_lack_creativity/,thedivision,1

But when a grenade pops next to you and you have no indication (red circle/efx) to tell you and only way you could've known is if you happened to see it at that exact moment, how am i supposed to survive this? From my experience, even if you build max armor, you top at \~2M. Even that wouldn't have kept me alive. 

I don't know, I'm just adding to the mountain of one-shot posts but it was at this point that I just alt+f4'd... what even is this game anymore...

Immersive World,Great concept, Incredible attention to detail in bringing the world to life..

The only IP on the market that is a Modern Military Shooter/RPG..

Interesting story and concept even if not always conveyed properly...

An ambitious project that never materialized into what they initially wanted to do..Maybe even too ambitious...

Interesting perks,skills and talents good weapon design.

Here is the problem we all have with the Game....

Pretty much none of it EVER WORKS AS INTENDED in one package.

Lessons learned during 2 years of D1:

The game was never properly coded from the beginning of development.

Bugs and glitches involving

Sound, Bullet Detection, Skills not Working, Talents not Working,Cover not Working, Difficulty not Properly Scaling, Enemies stick in spawn locations, PvP constantly clashing with PvE Balancing,Enemies DMG Scaling,Enemies Aggressiveness, Armor,DMG,Skills Exploits are all Problems we as players encountered in the lifespan of D1.

Countless Maintenances,Patches,Title Updates,PTS Servers,Content Creators Being invited for Input and Direction and a Salty Reddit...

After all of this Herculean Effort the Division 1 was close to what Massive envisioned and what the community for the most part wanted...

Than Massive tripped one day fell Down 7 Flights of Stairs and Miraculously survived but Forgot all They had Learnd.

With the success of the way D1 ended, The Division 2 came out with a bang.

Boys and Girls Young and Old happily Pre -Ordered and purchased the game.

We were all cautiously optimistic and excited Leveling was awesome just like in D1 the Honeymoon was Incredible.

Since no one knew that Massive had a Massive brain loss and had copied and pasted much of D1 into D2 at End Game all of the problems previously present came back one by one.

The new patches,Maintenances, PTS Servers,Title Updates started pouring in slowly introducing EVERY BUG THAT WAS EVER PRESENT IN D1....

W.O.N.Y was announced after of year of back and forth with great hype..

Boys and Girls lined up again the money started pouring in but this time Massive FORGOT TO EVEN HAVE A PTS for their huge Overhaul Update...

So here we are..... Coronavirus has turned the World upside down just like in the incredible world created by Massive.

Playing the New Update and going trough the Reddit forums at first there is Anger...than there is Sadness...which at some moment turns onto laughter and Humor....

Now I am kinda feeling bad for Massive....

How after 4 years can we end up with the WORSE ITERATION of the game?

Knowing what we are going trough in these dark times this is the WORSE time for the Devs to be dealing with literally every BUG and Problem we have ever encountered.

This is not a post about Money or time played or being Upset, this is a post about an IP that I ADORE and Love that is at the worse time possible suffering the most it EVER has....

Spending 3 out of 4 years FIXING the Game Prevents All of the Talent at Massive from CREATING....

I Sincerely Hope and Wish Everyone at Massive is well and in good shape to deal with the crisis at the moment.

But it saddens me to see the Reddit forums being filled with the same complaints,wants and needs we have been asking to be addressed for years.....

Unfortunately the game is at it's worse it has ever been in my opinion....

Me and my buddy have been taking part in leagues, we just wanna see the exotic cache and then we don't care anymore, but we figured we would try a bit of everything.

and after multiple Bunker missions runs, a few of the other 2. and 3 Heroic Roosoevelt Island run. I think I can safely say this game need to fix its shit before adding stuff like this. I get its all doable because clearly people are doing it. 

But I shouldn't have to deal with WALKING BACK INTO COVER AFTER A MOLOTOV HAS DISSIPATED. and proceeding to be one shot by non-existent fire. OR have us all blown up because the suicide bombers decide to be a fucking ninja until they're 2m close to you, and we're to busy distracted by the tanky pushers who don't even flinch at your bullets.

There are a ridiculous amount of issues wrong with this game right now, and in a game then is all about tactical cover, time trials can be SOMEWHAT cool and change how you play (aka sit in the back with your rifle because damage is broken in this game) but ultimately, this isn't working, its more tedious then anything. 

THERE'S A REASON WHY EVERY YOUTUBE BUILD I SEE ON MY FEED. has to highlight the fact that its the BEST DPS, BEST SOLO or BEST HEROIC clearer. because shit doesn't work properly and it feels like its becoming less about fun teamwork and just, how can we squeeze the best stats out and run that for everything.",12,1584855558,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmuuqp/fix_your_game_before_adding_these_dumb_time_trials/,thedivision,1

fmuqu4,RegnorVex,"Question about ""Outgoing healing""","Sorry if this has been beaten to death, but I've done a lot of searching on this term and I've found that there are opinions supporting every conceivable scenario I could think of. So I'm asking here for the latest consensus.

Here's my understanding:  The term ""Outgoing Healing"" applies to every heal that you initiate. This contrasts with the term ""Incoming Healing"" which is any heal initiated by something other than you.

Assume the following scenario: you have the Survivalist perk ""Triage Specialist"" (15% bonus to ""Outgoing Healing""), and your ally does not. If you put down a chem launcher, it will put out 15% more healing to anyone affected, including you or your ally. If your ally puts down a chem launcher heal, that will count as only ""Incoming Healing"" for you, so you will not get the 15% bonus, even though you have the perk.

A welcome fix which stopped hostage npc's from going full retard and running far away from the event, often pulling more enemy's and dying.  You changed it so they went full on combat mode and took cover at a reasonable distance and helped you kill the faction that had taken them hostage.


TU8 reversed this (among many others things that were patched in 2019) .

That too is now back and we have to liten to the CPs drivel all over again before we can hand in the junk they need.

3. Finish activity or mission and wait for everyone to leave (they all have to eventually). Or kindly ask the host to leave the group after

4. Level up the control point

5. Farm

&amp;#x200B;

How to farm a Control Point for targeted loot

1. Call allies and initiate attack

2. Clear off enemies until the first named enemy spawns

3. Kill named enemy only and pick up loot

5. Die and/or fast travel to a safe house

6. Fast travel to allies attacking the control point

fmscwu,Gour2216,Promising but very buggy,"With the warlords of ny, things are looking good for the future. Unfortunately the game is such a hot buggy mess it's impossible to enjoy now and the limited time events available to seasons are very difficult to participate in as a result of the bugs. There are many content creators making long lists of the bugs people have found but I wanted to list some bugs that were effecting me the most.

1) turret skill
   - does not fire when the button is pressed (sniper and mortar)
   - aim gets stuck in one spot making it impossible to target enemies (sniper and mortar)

2) seeker mines
   - appears to snapshot the location of enemies and seek out those locations and explode, even if the enemy is no longer there (cluster variant)

Since division 1 I enjoyed skill builds and I'm happy a supportive role is coming back in the division 2, but the skills rarely work well and it makes the game very hard to enjoy.

As much as I would love to play this game now, for my own mental and emotional health I should probably take a break until these bugs get fixed, which mean I'll miss out on limited time events.

fmr32r,BLCKART,Good example of whats wrong with sponginess &amp; AI / mechanics since WONY,"

[Linked Video](https://youtu.be/OwVtGA8h2HQ)

Hey Agents,

I was playing a bit tonight and got some recorded minutes of what we are facing at the moment... I think this moment shows a lot of things that are wrong with the scaling and the AI! I cant believe how bad they messed this up with the WONY update.

The TTK was just fine before. If they wanted to make enemies more challenging - they should have simply made them deadlier - put out more damage - and maybe smarter, rather that throwing bullet sponges with shitty mechanics at us. Thats not fun - its just frustrating to play against.

I have a well optimized build - play mostly solo and get along well. CP4s are not fun but I‘ll take them with my build. What you see in the video is in the world set to challenging - just a „usual“ open world boss...a healer... I was keeping distance and was glad there were some civilians taking some shots for me - else that f***er would just rush and meele my butt to oblivion - happend to often...

Some points that I‘d like to point out.

* look at how that f***er heals while being bursted down

fmqi67,CoronaTester247,My experience with this game,"So due to Corona me and my friends need to stay home so we decided to choose a game to play together and grind it. We decided for Division 2 because some of my friends already got the game when buying their GPU, and we played division 1 on PS4 and hoped for Division 2 to be a more polished game. With the game already beeing released a year ago and already having DLC content we got into the game, grinded WoNY got equip decent enough to beat challenge difficulty no problem.  But the game feels like a Beta. SO many bugs that should have been fixed a hole year after the games release. Just a few bugs that annoyed us the most:

First of all it is declared a tactic shooter, yet the most crucial elements for a tactic shooter are not finished all. The guy that had the idea to put ""evasive role"" and take cover on the same button needs to be fired lol. Enemies are sometimes stuck behind doors or walls and you cannot reach them, which is incredibly annoying when you are almost finished with a headhunt and cant progress. Headhunts sometimes dont give some party members any kind of reward for finishing. Having ""loot"" and ""loot all"" on the same button is a decision equally intelligent as the spacebar decision. There are many confusing menus in Division 2 which could easily be made more clearly with just a little effort. Party members glitching through the floor or beeing completly desynced from host. And the complete hold back of information, for example when we were in DZ we met some dudes that seemed friendly and our host said he got an invite when i realised i got one as well. It just said ""PlayerX has invited you"" and when we accepted their invite they turned hostile and mashed us up. I dont get why it was not possible to make the text read ""PlayerX has invited you TO A DUEL"". 

&amp;#x200B;

One whole year after the games release bugs/mistakes like these are just embarassing for the devs but after looking around on reddit/youtube they seemingly do not care what the players want. Thats a shame since the game could have so much potential. But with this game i already had so many moments in which i just thought ""Oh cmon this game is BS and this is no fun"" and 4 of my 5 friends seem to be on my side. Right now we are looking for another game to play since we decided to leave Division 2 behind and maybe check on it again in 1 or 2 years. 

I always wanted to like this game because there are just a few MMO FPS that actually are fun but sadly Division 2 is none of them. Ubisoft if you actually care about this game you should fix the stuff the players tell you to.

fmqekw,TyFighter559,Ran my first Heroic today,"Tried my first ever Heroic on Roosevelt for the League points and didn’t really know what to expect. I tried to solo with an all red build, but found myself getting hit with too much fire and explosions which forced me out of cover. Bad times

Decided to turn on matchmaking and capped it at just two of us. THIS was the ticket. I was surprised that the enemies were far easier to kill than in 4 man challenging. Like not even close.

Enemies really just felt easier in general. We both used revive hive, we were both pretty damage focused and we trudged through just fine. Just maintain distance and focus on suicide bombers and grenadiers. The sledge-bro’s went down easy with Signature weapons.

In the end we finished at about 30-ish minutes (level 5 for the league) so I was pretty pleased.

My only real problem has already been discussed here: the health of the gas tanks. Clips on clips on clips of ammo to take them down even with the mounted weapons. You have to either be very exposed or use precious personal reserves in the final area. 

Otherwise, not bad! Solid loot, couple of great rolls and I finished lvl 35 on my season card so I picked up the Coyote mask as well. Solid 7.5/10 experience. Will probably only do it again for future leagues.

fmqbxl,Vern-dawg,I think Massive has painted themselves into a corner with the stat roll values,"I am spending a lot of my time just farming gear for rolls in the recal library as I am not real sure what will be viable after Massive makes their changes to address the player squishiness and the NPC tankyness. As I was looting and storing today, I was just taking notice of the roll values and really thinking, there is no way to balance the game with this gear. 

Perhaps this is something that is already being talked about, but I haven’t seen it any threads, nor did a quick search show me any discussions about it, so apologies if I am retreading a tired topic here. But there is no way you can balance time to kill when the stat rolls associated with a full DPS build, and a full tank build. When a dps player has the ability to be running 60% more weapon damage than a skill or armor build (not even counting talent bonuses, weapon bonuses, or minor attributes), there is no way to balance the game so that a dps player kill an NPCs in more than a couple AR rounds, AND an armor/tank/skill build will feel like they are actually doing anything with their guns. 

Skill players at least have a few engaging options to play the game either as a damage dealer or healer; but I don’t see a way to make an armor build interesting at all. Buffing armor won’t do anything, as in my opinion, no one wants to run around shooting the equivalent of a squirt gun, even if they are basically invincible. I think the attribute and brand set values should be adjusted down so that the difference between dps and survivability isn’t so large.

fmpwz2,OcelotInTheCloset,"Technically a new player, questions about the store add ons, as well as level 30 boost.","I think I understand this correctly now, the level 30 boost basically voids a ton of achievements and locks off content from being played. This sucks, I only realized this about 30 minutes ago. One of the major reasons I haven't joined friends in Division 2 is that when I think about the ungodly grind I have to endure to catch up to them. I thought this boost was a hail mary of a solution, but I'm a completionist and any dreams I had of using the feature have been crushed. You cannot imagine my disappointment, I was rather excited to play today. 

I'm deciding to say screw it, and start from scratch. I am tempted to buy the year one bundle and deluxe edition just to have something nice and non standard to sort of motivate me to get through the ordeal of leveling, max'ing out specializations, and any of the other time consuming game systems. I'm just unclear as to what the year one bundle implies for achievements. Is there anything voided, content or achievement wise, by buying this bundle? I can't even use the unlocked specializations until 30, right? And I assume they're unleveled. 

Lastly, does anyone have any pro tips, like what to do or not do right away, to make this process of starting from scratch more efficient? Should I wait until level 40 until unlocking the caches and chests? Do I save side missions until I'm ready to do specializations?

Their one use of being a revive is completely useless because only one of them can, so if agents go down none of the civs have enough health or do enough damage to do literally anything. Does Massive care to fix it? Of course not, since it's not a bug that benefits the player there's no rush. Oh an LMG did .01% more dmg than it should have?????? Immediate patch.

fmoo48,Pizzamorg,"Man, the first Division is really refreshing (and harrowing).","Picked up the first Division in the Ubisoft Sale a couple of weeks ago. Putting in a couple of hours here and there between grinding Division 2. I've never played it on PC before and I never really got into it when I played it on PS4, but with Warlords I feel like I need to brush up on my Division knowledge.  

Saw some clips on YouTube of the game looking real bad, but that must be consoles, because on my PC this game blew me away by how stunning it is, The atmosphere and visual design in this is just *chefs kiss*. Although, the character creator is awful. 

I remember the story sorta falling apart a bit at the end, but so far I'm really enjoying the structure of it all. It is obviously very harrowing given what is going on right outside in our own world, but I'm enjoying my activation and gearing up. Division 2 feels a lot more cartoony by comparison, which I guess is fine, but this feels more like a horror game and I'm digging it. Even within the world, it feels like the night cycles are far longer than any of the day ones.   

Best of all is the tuning of combat, though. Like, guns and skills in themselves don't feel as good as they do in the sequel but man, crispy one shots on redbars with headshots on my sniper, I missed you! I mean really if they want a harder Division 2, why not just tune it like Division 1? You still die very quickly if you get caught out of position or out of cover, but you can give it just as good. That is how it should be. 

(Although I do remember getting some pretty gamebreakingly strong healing skills back when I played it on PS4. I wonder if those are still here. Maybe don't carry those over.)   

In fairness, you can really feel in general the strides Massive made in streamlining and modernising so much of Division 1, in the sequel. The UI especially in Division 1 is horrid. In fact, loot is pretty horrid, from a processing of information standpoint, anyway. So many menus upon sub menus upon menus of stats and my mind is exploding. Such a cluster fuck. Hopefully it'll all make sense once I'm actually crafting a build, rather than just levelling. 

Anyone else playing this in response to their frustrations with the current state of Division 2, while still needing that Division fix?",4,1584830715,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmoo48/man_the_first_division_is_really_refreshing_and/,thedivision,1
fmonv9,sniphskii,"Another day, another DPS glitch","Okay, once again a DPS glitch was found in the division 2 (inevitable really) but obviously no one cares about it being used for PvE. The main issue is it being used in PvP.

In order to address these glitches and stop them from getting into pvp all together is to have a mandatory reconnection when entering PvP areas of the game (like how sometimes you get scanned by ISAC and it reloads the game)

This would stop the damage glitch for PVP forever, as the glitches thus far have relied on the game being in the same state to carry over glitches values.

So while it's likely we'd see more damage glitches, it's unlikely at that point we'd be seeing them at all in Pvp",34,1584830693,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/fmonv9/another_day_another_dps_glitch/,thedivision,1
