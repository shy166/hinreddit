Regardless of the final decision of the FA &amp; Premier League, we believe this is the only fair outcome. The current state of limbo has gone on long enough, and we felt we couldn't wait any longer than today to announce this decision. Therefore, anyone pretending that Liverpool are not Premier League champions may have their comments removed and/or be banned. From now on, all posts and comments must accept the current standings as the final standings.

fskda2,Gigs9876,Coronavirus and the transfermarket,"So I started wondering about this while reading about the Coutinho to Leicester rumour.

People were starting to question whether Leicester had the money to sign someone like Coutinho to which I originally wanted to reply that in addition, most teams probably won't have that much money to spend this summer as they have taken a huge financial hit by the loss of revenue caused by the current situation. But then I thought, actually the same is the case for all teams and for example if this put Barcelona in financial difficulties, they might have to sell someone like Coutinho for way less than usually. Bottom line is, the way transfer deals are made, the prices, and which teams will want to sell their players might be completely different than they would have had the coronavirus not happened.

So what do you think will the consequences be? Which teams will profit, which teams might sign players they otherwise wouldn't have and which teams will sell players nobody expected them to sell a few weeks ago?",2,1585685755,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fskda2/coronavirus_and_the_transfermarket/,soccer,1

[NOS.nl:](https://nos.nl/artikel/2328834-promes-en-groningen-spits-redan-door-t-stof-na-domme-fout.html)

Translation:  
It was a remarkable movie that turned up this weekend. Ajacied Quincy Promes, FC Groningen striker Daishawn Redan and some others happily kicked a ball on an Amsterdam square. By doing so they broke the rules of confluence that apply because of the coronavirus.

A deliberate action, witness the joking ""quarantine, gappies"" and ""hey, quarantine squad"" that shouted over the square.

Sorry  
After Promes and Redan were approached by their clubs about their behavior, both apologized. Promes did so via a short statement on his Instagram channel.

""I miss football, but in hindsight it was not wise to go outside in these circumstances"", writes the striker of Ajax and the Dutch national team.

According to FC Groningen, Redan has also apologized and is going to make a donation to a supporters initiative, Noordtribune Helpt, that helps people in the region in these coronation times.

""This is behaviour that we do not want to see. We appealed to him about that. Daishawn was very guilty,"" reports technical director Mark-Jan Fledderus on the website of FC Groningen.",5,1585592316,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/frw1xw/promes_and_redan_made_a_stupid_mistake/,soccer,1

frrtso,IrnBroski,Nani‚Äôs red card vs Real Madrid ‚Äì an analysis,"For the past 8 years or so, I have been writing notes. Some of them are musings, some of them are reminders of things I should do, a to-do list of sorts.

One of these notes reads ‚ÄúNani red card.‚Äù It has been sitting on a piece of paper for around 7 years. After reading and participating in a discussion from [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/frlfgw/casemiro_fallon_d_floor_vs_tottenhan/flwikhp/), I have decided that today is the day I cross off that note from my list.

For those who haven‚Äôt seen it, or just want a reminder, here is [the incident in question]( https://youtu.be/II3TnI2FOAo?t=214) (timestamp ‚Äì 3:34). It was a painful moment at the time and, for many Manchester United fans, still hurts now. The legendary Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äôs final season in charge at the club, in a game we were winning until that pivotal moment. Nani was sent off, and Real Madrid went on to score 2 goals ‚Äì an amazing strike from Luka Modric and a sliding tap-in from Cristiano Ronaldo who refused to celebrate against his old club. The then-manager of Real Madrid, Jose Mourinho, famously declared in the post-match interview that ‚Äúthe better team lost.‚Äù

At the time, I believed it was a harsh decision. Looking back on it, I still believe it to be a harsh decision. This is not to say it was not a foul ‚Äì but a red card was an incredibly unexpected and unnecessary punishment.

There are two other infamous tackles in recent history with which I will compare and contrast this tackle. The first is [Nigel de Jong vs Xabi Alonso at the 2010 World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqLn0F8jXk). The second is [Sadio Mane vs Ederson from the Premier League in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2pnJFtz6k4). Both are, on the surface, quite similar to Nani‚Äôs incident ‚Äì high boots making contact with opposition players leading to fouls. However, there are subtle differences between all three cases.

[UEFA‚Äôs Champion‚Äôs League document]( https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/60/37/12/2603712_DOWNLOAD.pdf) from this season states that all games are to be played in conformity with the [IFAB  laws of the game]( https://www.theifab.com/laws), which can be found on FIFA‚Äôs website. Unfortunately, I cannot find the IFAB rules from 2012-3.
The closest I can find is [this FIFA video from 2012-13 explaining the 17 laws in some detail](https://youtu.be/kJcR7CNMdQc?t=2361), timestamped at 39:21 for the relevant section; Law 12, Fouls and Misconduct. However, it does not go into as much detail as the written documents.
____

A. What constitutes a freekick?

&gt;A direct freekick is awarded against any player who commits any of the following seven offences;

&gt;*Kicks or attempts to kick an opponent in a careless or reckless manner, or by using excessive force*

&gt; Trips or attempts to trip an opponent in a careless or reckless manner

&gt; *Jumps at an opponent in a careless or reckless manner, or by using excessive force*

&gt; *Charges an opponent in a careless or reckless manner*

&gt; Strikes or attempts to strike an opponent in a careless manner, or by using excessive force

&gt; Pushes an opponent in a careless or reckless manner , or by using excessive force

&gt; Tackles an opponent in a careless or reckless manner , or by using excessive force



B. What constitutes a yellow card?

&gt;	There are seven cautionable offences. The cautionable offences are;

&gt;	*Unsporting Behaviour* (a variety of challenges deemed reckless are shown)

&gt;	Dissent

&gt;	Persistent Infringement

&gt;	Delaying Re-start

&gt;	Distance from ball on restart

&gt;	Entering or re-entering the field of play without referee‚Äôs permission

&gt;	Leaving the field of play without referee‚Äôs permission



C. What constitutes a red card?


&gt;	There are seven sending-off offences

&gt;	*Serious foul play ‚Äì a player is guilty of serious foul play if he uses excessive force or brutality against an opponent when challenging for the ball when it‚Äôs in play*

&gt;	*Violent Conduct ‚Äì a player is guilty of serious foul play if he uses excessive force or brutality against an opponent when not challenging for the ball*

&gt;	Spitting

&gt;	Denying goalscoring opportunity via handball

&gt;	Denying goalscoring opportunity via offence otherwise punishable by a freekick

&gt;	A second caution
___

I have italicised the relevant sections.

In order to further investigate the definition, I am using two more documents ‚Äì [a FIFA handbook from 2004](https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_12_fouls_misconduct_en_47379.pdf) regarding fouls and the latest set of IFAB guidelines as linked above. I am working on the assumption that, if the guidelines provided are identical between these two documents, then they would have been the same at the time of the Nani red card, which occurred roughly at the midpoint between their publications.

Both documents differentiate between what is careless, reckless and using excessive force, and provide identical definitions and punishments for these;
____

&gt;Careless is when a player shows a lack of attention or consideration when making a challenge or acts without precaution. *No disciplinary sanction is needed*

&gt;Reckless is when a player acts with disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, an opponent and *must be cautioned*

&gt;Using excessive force is when a player exceeds the necessary use of force and/or endangers the safety of an opponent and *must be sent off*



Now we can start to differentiate between the tackles. Firstly, the worst of the three- De Jong's ""kung fu kick"" on Xabi Alonso.

Firstly, it is clearly a foul, since he fulfils 2 of the 7 criteria for fouls in one move - jumping, and kicking an opponent.. Furthermore, it is a clear red card because at the very least, he is using excessive force and brutality against an opponent when challenging for the ball. It could also be argued (and I believe) that he isn't even challenging for the ball. There is no attempt to play the ball, only an attempt to leave a footprint in Xabi Alonso's chest. **It is a clear red card,** and much worse than Nani's offence, despite a poster in the original thread claiming they were both the same thing.

___

Both documents then provide further clarification for what constitutes serious foul play, with relevance to the 2 remaining tackles. Again, their wording is pretty much identical.

&gt;A tackle or challenge that endangers the safety of an opponent or uses excessive force or brutality must be sanctioned as serious foul play.

&gt; Any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force or endangers the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.

This is where Man√©'s challenge also falls into red card territory. Ederson is pretty much in his unbroken line of sight for the entire duration of his run towards the ball, so he very much aware of him, and lunges towards him with a high boot that endangers Ederson's safety in a serious manner. Again, **a clear red card**.

___

Now for Nani. Despite the fact that I came into this thread with the mission of exonerating Nani, it is clear that there is a grey area in the rules, where things are left to a referee's interpretation. One the one hand, any tackle that endangers the safety of an opponent must be sanctioned as serious foul play, and as such, would constitute a red card. It could be argued that, regardless of intention, Nani's tackle did that.

However, there are also guidelines provided on what constitutes careless and reckless tackles. The definition for reckless would fall under the definition for endangering the safety of an opponent. However, one is sanctioned as a red card, and one as a yellow card. If could deemed reckless, Nani was deserving of a caution, not a red card. It could be argued that Nani wasn't reckless, but was careless. It could even be argued that he was careful (I'll get to that.) But I acknowledge the grey area.

In Nani's defence, assuming he was unaware that Arbeloa was there - he performs a movement, that players perform many times, and nobody bats an eyelid. In fact, often, they are praised for good control. It simply happened to be that Arbeloa occupied the space where he would have controlled the ball. It reminds me of this [Simpson's scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSoJDUD_bU), except in Bart's case, he is culpable because he is doing something unnatural with knowledge that Lisa will occupy space. In Nani's case, he is doing something natural with no knowledge of Arbeloa. If this was the case, then Nani's tackle would be considered careless at worst, and not even deserving of a booking.

Some posters have pointed out that perhaps Nani *was* aware of Arbeloa. The author of [this video](https://youtu.be/V2jpB2PAkZs) seems to believe that Nani's glance over his shoulder indicates he was aware of Arbeloa. If this was the case then Nani's challenge was at the best reckless and could be interpreted as serious foul play. This would place it somewhere in-between yellow card and red card territory. 

However, that video is far from conclusive. It is played back at super slow motion which makes the glance seem a lot longer than it is. If you look at the initial, normal speed video, it is a split second glance, not very long to assess the movement of players running towards you. Furthermore, it being a super slow motion video, we get a good look at exactly the direction Nani glances in and the direction Arbeloa runs in from, and it's very likely that, at best, Nani might have seen Arbeloa in his peripheral vision, for that split second glance - barely enough to register him running towards him and distinguish him from the rest of the peripheral blur in his vision. It's possible that Nani didn't see Arbeloa *at all* in which case his glance could be construed as making sure there weren't any players and taking the due care, in which case it arguably wouldn't have even been a careless challenge.

Some have used the argument that if Nani knew the space ahead was free, why didn't he let the ball drop to the ground and run onto it- but this is Nani we're talking about. He always liked the ball at his feet. This isn't a great argument.

One of the things that worked against Nani in this situation was, in my opinion, his propensity to roll around on the ground, which he did after this collision. This could be seen by some as an indication of guilt and could have influenced the referee's decision. It could even be seen as simulation and then deserving of a yellow card in and of itself. This is a separate argument, but perhaps one that has merit.

However, it must also be said that Nani was never the *type* of player to lunge in recklessly. He wasn't really the type to make many tackles, full stop. His foot shape in the initial incident doesn't indicate someone trying to do damage, but someone trying to (and very nearly pulling off perfect) control of the ball. He got sent off one other time at Man Utd, which was [a provoked headbutt against Lucas Neill](https://youtu.be/w72GZStPaj4?t=115).

____
In conclusion, after looking at various definitions and rules, and contrasting different tackles, it's still not 100% clear. However, there are cogent arguments for this tackle being a yellow card, a red card, and not a card at all.

Taking this into consideration, as well as all the contextual information about the situation, I can retain my conclusion that the referee is a wanker, and I demand a replay.

[Burnley's 4-4-2\(?\)](https://preview.redd.it/i1pbtve93sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=523b8fca24f19475605788e2d2317a4f234242ff)

Again, the only other side that can field a full 11, and having a goalkeeper would mean they'd comfortably beat other sides. 2nd to Sheffield United as they're higher in the Premier League and overall the better side compared to Burnley.

3rd) Manchester United

&amp;#x200B;

[Manchester United's 6-1-2](https://preview.redd.it/zefwk0634sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9948be88f801ddd346c5307336526f880a664825)

With the luxury of being able to field 9 outfield players and having a goalkeeper, this puts them ahead of the other 7 teams. If Shaw and Rashford were to play as wingers and one of the centrebacks were to join Lingard this may add some balance to the team.

4th) Leicester

&amp;#x200B;

[Leicester's 3-5-2](https://preview.redd.it/x9sfonns5sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c342457f96203d8bf8a6e0ffc8b2fa4111e87e2)

While having no keeper, this team is one of the most balanced and could easily win the ball back, retain possession and score goals. Interestingly enough, the majority of this side has already heavily featured this season.

5th) Liverpool

&amp;#x200B;

[Liverpool's 2-3-2](https://preview.redd.it/o23bu7547sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eef9d413a2a0bd4165a9d4c633223987b4c1e58f)

While they do have a goalkeeper, Liverpool simply would be at an outfield disadvantage to Leicester equivalent of 3 red cards. Overall, however, I'd say they're better than the rest in both quality and quantity as well as the added bonus of having a goalkeeper.

6th) Arsenal

&amp;#x200B;

[Arsenal's 4-2-1](https://preview.redd.it/k295rnzt8sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d525cefbf6db277a9b303f6266dc31324d4190)

Not many of the 11 are seasoned starters for Arsenal, however, the team is relatively balanced and as it begins to get desperate (see Wolves) clearly inferior to Liverpool in talent and experience, they would finish 6th.

7th) Chelsea

&amp;#x200B;

[Chelsea's 2-5-1](https://preview.redd.it/lbwj5j7x9sp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbc3ceec51db569cb6f28f6fc4edb7317ff95cbc)

Interestingly enough about Chelsea's 8 is that all but Barkley are homegrown, compared that to the other teams in the list. Again the outfield team is arguably better than Arsenal's however the lack of West London-based/English goalkeeper is their downfall.

8th) Tottenham Hotspur

&amp;#x200B;

[Tottenham's 1-5-1](https://preview.redd.it/aio4v163bsp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=334000c463d6720c40bee6ed9efb0d607dc39b76)

Lacking in numbers compared to the teams above as well not having a goalkeeper is their downfall, however the team has many talented starters and you could pick a strong 5-a-side out of that 7. Somewhat better than the remaining 2 teams.

9th) Manchester City

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img us8q3bktbsp41...*

I wanted to use the word pathetic, but I'll reserve that for Wolverhampton, if not for their loan signing of Carson they would be bottom. Severely lacking but ultimately irrelevant considering their overall success.

10th) Wolverhampton Wanderers

&amp;#x200B;

[Wolves' 2-1-0](https://preview.redd.it/u4xeody8csp41.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e994a1b9f19b87aa472047095f9610f54b898fe)

Pathetic. Even worse, of this side, only Coady has made more than 3 appearances in the Premier League this season. Like Manchester City, however, this isn't important as they're clearly doing well both this season and the last.

* I only chose players from the First Squad on TransferMarkt
* The distance shown is roughly the driving distance from the 'upbringing' area to the respective stadium
* I'm a Leicester fan and was impressed when we had 3 local lads on this pitch at once, to which it made me think how we compared to the rest of the league, etc. 
* Even though we're in lockdown, I couldn't be arsed to the other 10, but if you want me to do the full league and possibly the Top 8/12 European teams, I'll do it.
* Someone, please find a cure to this virus, otherwise, this is the content we have to live with.
* This isn't intended to be some kind of weird nationalistic post either, Football is incredibly globalised and all the better for it!",28,1585571117,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/frpud0/how_the_top_10_of_the_premier_league_rank_with/,soccer,1

frov40,yellowsilver,Does attractive football or high/counter pressing ever work for smaller teams?,"Obviously being good in possession (not pep style 70/30 great in possesion, but 60/40 having more of it than not) and pressing at least relatively high up the pitch is the often the more attractive playstyle, but how realistic is it for all teams to follow it?


I'd say for bigger teams this playstyle is more of a necessity, as without the ball it's easier for smaller teams to time waste, and as they'll attack less there'll be less chances to counter attack them as they wont commit many players forward. Lastly, because they keep more players back they can be harder to get around, so you need more of the ball to create as much chances as possible to compensate for this.


as for smaller teams, I'd argue they often need to play ugly football as due to having a lack of quality in personnel, the chances of them being able to hold onto to ball without making deadly mistakes whilst in transition under pressure and also not leave themselves open to counter attacks are higher.


Some, like pep for instance, beleive teams should be positive no matter and I have a feeling a lot of people on here feel the same, so was wondering what people thought as well as if there's an abundance of relegation teams that played great football, or managers who are good at playing great football with lesser teams",47,1585566780,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/frov40/does_attractive_football_or_highcounter_pressing/,soccer,1

frc0s7,displacedindavis,Longest active title droughts by teams that have actually won titles,"The idea of this post came to me thinking about my dad. He's a long-time Arsenal fan. I get it, Arsenal really doesn't have *that* long a title drought compared to other clubs, but I started watching the sport in the late 2000s and, yeah, Arsenal never won since then so I've never been able to see him celebrate. He always says he's given up on the team after every single season and yet at the start of the next season, he's back to rooting for Arsenal. Fan loyalties can be a strange thing, but for the most die-hard of fans, they're unbreakable no matter how much the team has made you suffer.

There are a *ton* of teams that have never won league titles so I won't be able to go through all of those. I'll just be limiting myself to teams that have won league titles. And as an extra limiting factor, I'm going to say that a long drought is 50 years or more, although I cannot guarantee I'll get to all of them. I would love to talk about teams like Everton, Bayer Leverkusen, or Cruz Azul, but sadly, their droughts don't meet this criteria. But my heart still goes out to those fans. Hope they win a title soon.

It's actually really sad to me that a lot of fans have lived their entire lives without ever seeing their favorite team win a title. It's kind of ignorant to tell those fans that ""it's just a game"" (especially if you root for a team like Barcelona at the same time). We root for teams for various reasons and oftentimes they're very sentimental and not to an unreasonable degree either. I think fans that have the guts to stick with teams even when they haven't won for a while deserve a lot of respect.

Seeing the completely unexpected success of my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fj5di7/bar√ßa_is_actually_playing_against_as_monaco/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) here about Rocket League and Monaco vs Bar√ßa, I thought people could be interested in a little guide for the most important event of the season, the Regionals (EU version) happening in a few hours. 

At least it's some kind of football, right ? Even if it's esports, there still isn't any live football going on (minus in Belarus). So maybe you'll be interested in this as a temporary replacement. And since it's online (and the casters have been moved to cast from their home as well) it won't stop. I'll help you with a little presentation of the game, the event, the teams (compared to real football teams), and their players (identified to their real player counterpart) 

# The game

For those who don't know it, *Rocket League* is a fast paced football game, played 3v3 in a closed arena, and where players are rocket powered cars that can fly. It seems goofy described like that, but there's actually a lot of depth in the game with the real 3rd dimension created by the flying cars, and the fact that you can't fly indefinitely (you need to pick up boosts around the pitch to fill your tank). Depth that is followed by real intensity that makes the game an incredible esport to watch with very few idle time during the play. One of the only rules is that the ""legs"" (series are usually played in best of 7, with each leg lasting 5 minutes) doesn't end once the 5 minutes are over, it ends when the ball touches the ground after that. Which result in increased tension, and legendary moments like this [goal](https://m.twitch.tv/clip/HonestPlacidKeyboardChefFrank) by Jstn in the season 5 Worlds grandfinals.

# The event

After 8 weeks of League play where the 10 best teams in Europe battled it out, the 6 best teams in the standings will face off in a playoffs bracket to crown the EU Regional Champion. The playoff [bracket](https://imgur.com/a/WBJjUMO) is a bit weird, but it's because its usual role is to find the 4 best teams of the region that will represent EU in the World Championship. With the Worlds canceled (yes, even esports events are concerned), the Regionals will be *the* premier event of the season, and had their prizepool readjusted with ~$100k for the winning team.

# The teams

**6th, [FC Barcelona](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/FC_Barcelona)**(*regular season : 5-4*), aka *FC Barcelona*. Yeah that one was easy I'll admit, but there's still some similarities between the playstyle of both teams. This RL Barcelona team likes to have the ball under control as much as possible, and scores a lot of passing plays as well, even if they tend to use counterattacks a lot more than their parent club. They started the season hot but struggled at the end, if they find back their form from the start of the season they could be serious contenders. 

Player to watch : *David [Deevo](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Deevo) Morrow (19, England), aka Marc Andre Ter Stegen*. A tremendous defender and goal keeper this season, winning games with his saves like MAtS. 

**5th, [Veloce Esports](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Veloce_Esports)**(*regular season 5-4*), aka *Atletico de Madrid*. Their playstyle can be described as waiting for the opponents mistakes to punish them. Often deemed as a lucky team they are much more than that, and their solidity in all aspects of the game is backed by great counter attacking abilities, much like what Simeone's Atl√©tico is renown for. Their solidity could carry them to victory, even if they are underdogs. 

Player to watch : *Sandro [Freakii](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/FreaKii) Holzwarth (23, Germany), aka Saul Niguez*. This team is much more a collective unit than a sum of individualities. But Freakii represents well the solidity of Veloce with his near mistake free playstyle, great passing ability, good defensive abilities, and good striking abilities. A great all around player, resembling the Spanish midfielder. 

**4th, [Mousesports](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Mousesports)**(*regular season : 6-3*), aka *Borussia Dortmund*. They are a very inconsistent team, with bursts of brilliance and a playstyle based on fast attacking and trying to outscore their opponents because their defense is questionable at times. They also just had a prospect sub in late in the season that has immediately made an impact, which also is comparable to Borussia's situation with Haaland. Huge underdogs with the late sub coming in, they could still surprise. 

Player to watch : *Ario [Arju](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Arju) Berdin (Italy) aka Erling Haaland*. Coming almost out of nowhere (subs in RL are nothing compared to football, they are just names put on a paper and barely even train with the main roster), he has adapted very quickly to the highest level and changed the way Mouse played in the last 2 series of the season when he had to subbed in. Also quite comparable to the Norwegian striker in his ball control and technicity. 

**3rd, [Team Reciprocity ](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Team_Reciprocity)**(*regular season : 6-3*) aka *Bayern Munich*. A team with both a star player, but at the same time a well-oiled collective machine. Their playstyle is based on passing plays and sustained attacks with physicality. Quite like the German giant in that regard. They are strong contenders, especially if Chausette is on. 

Player to watch : *Thibault [Chausette45](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Chausette45) Grzesiak (19,¬† France), aka Robert Lewandowski*. When he's on, he's the best player in the world, able to dribble easily around defenses and making incredible solo plays, carrying his team on his back a lot like the Polish striker. 

**2nd, [Dignitas](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Dignitas)**(*regular season 7-2*), aka *Manchester City*. Their playstyle is very similar to Guardiola's Man City at their peak, with non ending attacking pressure and heavy reliance on quick passing plays. They are near unstoppable and beautiful to watch, 2nd favorites to win today. 

Player to watch : *Maello [AztraL](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Aztral) Ernst (17, Belgium), aka Kevin De Bruyne*. He shares with his countryman the fact that he's in the discussion for best player in the world, with incredible technical abilities and both striking and passing capacities. Also a fearful consistency playing at such a high level.

**1st, [Renault Vitality](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Renault_Vitality)**(*regular season 8-1*), aka *Paris Saint Germain*. With an all star and all French roster playing for a french org it had to be PSG. Serial winners like PSG is domestically, they are the last season Worlds grand finalists, and have been dominating this European League play. Their playstyle also resembles the French juggernaut with both passing plays and incredible solo plays when necessary to break up a defense. Heavy favorites to win it all today. 

Player to watch : *Alexandre [Kaydop](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Kaydop) Courant (21, France), aka Neymar*. But actually what Neymar would have been without his multiple injuries. He's in the discussion for goat of RL, with 3 World Championship titles. He has also been in the Worlds grandfinal every time since season 3, so 6 appearances in a row. That consistency at the highest level is just out of this world. He's regarded at the best striker of the game, but also has tremendous playmaking abilities that are often overlooked. 2nd in both the Golden striker and playmaker awards this season.",1,1585495821,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fr7m8t/theres_still_some_kind_of_live_football_going_on/,soccer,1

fr72rn,gcwrestling08,Taking a free kick or throw in behind the official spot?,"I was watching a Belorussian match -- Team A was down 1-0 in stoppage time when Team B cleared the balls and it went out of bounds around midfield.

Since there aren't ball boys on the sidelines with balls at the ready, the Team A player had to rush all the way down the sidelines, almost to his own goal line, to retrieve the ball. In an effort to save time, he picked it up and threw it in to a teammate, but the ref blew it dead and forced them to re-throw at the mark it went out of bounds near midfield.

My question is: why? Is this an actual rule in all leagues? I don't see how you can penalize a team for getting the ball in play behind the spot that it went out. If Team A wants to get the ball in play even further from their opponent's goal, it seems like this should be allowed. I'm sure Team B didn't really mind.

This also got me thinking about free kicks. Is it also against the rules to take a free kick behind the spot of infringement? I was thinking teams could take advantage of this even more in this instance.

For example, say you get a free kick right outside of the box. To get a better angle and avoid the wall, can you not just move the ball back? I'm struggling to understand why the referee would force a team to put the ball in play even further away from their opponent's goal if they wanted to, for whatever the reason may be.",2,1585493712,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fr72rn/taking_a_free_kick_or_throw_in_behind_the/,soccer,1

fr57ld,LordoftheYaks,Picking team in the Belarus league,"For those who have not yet decided on their favorite team in the best championship of the post-apocalypse era, I offer an excellent option - **Energetik-BGU.** Reasoning:

(1) Maximum(!) salary p.m. 330 USD. No expensive cars, trips to Alps, just a bunch of lads playing footie because they love it

(2) Average team age - 22 yrs

(3) Fun and reckless football style: scored on average 3.9 goals last season (52 scored - 66 conceded), while the average for the championship was 2.6

(4) ""Dutch"" football philosophy (and uniform). Search for semi talented players, beef them up and then sell at the first opportunity

(5) Very hard working and disciplined team. Start training 2 weeks before everyone else during mid season when other teams are still chilling on the beach. Work out on outdated rusty equipment and sleep on old mats in the gym between training sessions. Super tough coach (similar to Felix Magat)

(6) A couple of young talented players to follow. David Twe (Liberia) in midfield and Jasur Yashiboev (Uzberkistan) in attack",56,1585485160,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fr57ld/picking_team_in_the_belarus_league/,soccer,1

fr4pid,dumbwatercba,Bayer Neverkusen.,"Bayer Leverkusen. Perhaps the unluckiest side in football.  5-time Bundesliga runners up. The only major titles to their name are a single DFB-Pokal and a UEFA Cup. In the 2001/02 season the nickname Neverkusen was born.
Bayer Leverkusen almost had the league title in the 1999/2000 season. All they needed was a draw on the final day to take the trophy. But on the against Unterhaching on the final day, they were beaten 2-0. With the first goal being an own goal scored by Michael Ballack. Giving the title to Bayern Munich on goal difference
As the 2001-02 season was winding down Leverkusen found themselves in 3 competitions. They were leading the Bundesliga, in the Champions league semi final and had booked their spot in Berlin for the DFB-Pokal final. But into May things took a turn for the worse.
 
How they lost the league
On the 20th of April 2002, Leverkusen were sitting top of the table with a 5-point lead over Dortmund. That day Werder Bremen came to the BayArena and took all 3 points, with a 2-1 win. Their lead had been sliced to 2 points, as Dortmund had scored from the penalty spot in the last minute of their match against Koln to snatch a 2-1 win. On the 27th April it was the penultimate league game. Leverkusen travelled to lowly Nuremberg. The objective was clear don‚Äôt lose. Leverkusen had a far greater goal difference to Dortmund so a point would all but surely give them the title. But at the Max-Morlock-Stadion FC.Nuremberg ran out winners, with Marek Nikl heading home in the 23rd minute. Elsewhere Dortmund had won 4-3 in Hamburg to go top of the table. Leverkusen‚Äôs devastating loss to Nuremberg can be seen as the moment they lost the league. When the 4th of May rolled around Leverkusen needed Werder Bremen to beat Dortmund if they were to have any hope of getting their hands on the title. Alas Dortmund defeated Bremen to win the league with 70 points. Leverkusen had fallen short by a point. Their win against Hertha Berlin had secured second spot but once they lost to Nuremberg it was out of their hands.

How they lost the cup
On the 5th of March Bayer Leverkusen secured their spot in the final with an extra time win over arch rivals Koln 3-1. In the other semi the next day Schalke knocked out Bayern Munich 2-0 in extra time. In Berlin at the famous Olympiastadion the final of the DFB-Pokal was taking place. 70,000 people gathered to watch Schalke take on Leverkusen on the 11th May. Leverkusen took the lead in the 27th minute through Dimitar Berbatov. Right before a half time Schalke scored directly from a free kick. The second half would be unpleasant for Leverkusen as they conceded 3. A consolation goal was scored by Kirsten in the 89th minute to end the game 4-2 to Schalke.
 
 
How they lost the Champions League
In the 2000/01 season Leverkusen finished 4th earning them a spot in the third qualifying round for next seasons champions league. A 3-0 aggregate win against Red Star Belgrade sent them through to the first group stage. They finished second in a group featuring Barcelona, Lyon and Fenerbahce. In the second group stage they topped a very close group featuring Depotivo La Coruna, Arsenal and Juventus. In the quarters they knocked out Liverpool 4-3 on aggregate. An away goals win followed against Manchester United sending Leverkusen to Glasgow to take on Spanish giants Real Madrid who dispatched Barcelona in the other semi-final.  On the 15th May at Hampden Park, Leverkusen had their final chance to taste glory that season. Leverkusen became the first team to appear in a champions league final without ever winning a national league. Real Madrid were seasoned Champions League veterans with 8 wins under their belt in 11 final appearances. This was Leverkusen‚Äôs first and only Champions league final appearance. The match got under way with Raul netting in the 8th minute. Lucio would respond in the 13th. But in the 45th Zinedine Zidane volleyed it into the top corner. This would go down as one of the greatest goals scored in a Champions League final. The second half would bring no joy for Leverkusen as they couldn‚Äôt find a way through despite Real Madrid being forced into bringing on a 20-year-old Iker Casillas to replace the injured Cesar. Bayer Leverkusen collected their third runners up medal of the season. Completing a silver treble.

The 2002 world cup
5 Leverkusen players were selected in the squad for the 2002 world cup in Japan and South Korea. Germany reached the final and was beaten by Brazil 2-0. Further adding insult to injury as those 5 collected their 4th silver medal that season.

Legacy
Bayer Leverkusen haven‚Äôt won a trophy since their DFB-Pokal in 1993. After the 2001/02 season they would go on to lose a cup final to Werder Bremen in 2009 and be runners up to the Bundesliga in 2010/11. At the moment they have a promising team and are in the semi final of the cup against 4th tier Saarbrucken.

Although it is of course sad to see any of our subscribers       struggling with their health - be it mental or physical - we have been greatly encouraged to see how supportive our community has been regarding these issues, and heartened that people have found /r/soccer a safe place in which they feel able to open up regarding issues which sadly do remain stigmatised in society at large. 

Regardless of the colour of your shirt (or the flair next to your username) we are all living, breathing human beings - and we all love the beautiful game. Everyone on /r/soccer deserves to be happy and well - so be kind. It can be a tough old world out there, and that kindness can go a long way.

fqwxfe,mrmalaki,How to finish the European season (Premier League focused),"The summer is now free to play in so sack off preseason break and as soon as logically and logistically possible get back up and running. 

But be sensible if 'clear' give two weeks training before a match to rebuild fitness and all that. This isn't to cause injuries. Also don't play midday in July, early morning and late evening games should be the norm in the summer.

There 9 games left + 3 FA Cup rounds domestically. So 12 weeks if you start August 1st you can finish mid October. If it stretches out to September start squeeze matches in to midweek.

November sees the completion of the Continental matches. Each team plays every 5 days getting the 6 match-days completed in 30 days. Also during this month lower League playoffs.

Most of Europe has a winter break. So leagues restart January 9th. Except England who start on Boxing Day and then New year's Day.

Instead of playing 38 games in a 5 month season (Jan to May) play eachother once so 19 games. Each game at a neutral ground to avoid draw bias (40% of tickets for the hosts, 30% for each playing team). Championship and below; no playoffs straight league finish promotion and relegation.

The FA, League Cup, EFL trophy and the FA trophy are modified with each team entering one tournament each with 64 places in each the best placed finish from 2020 season gets to pick which they enter as long as they would normally be eligible for it. (so if they don't want a cup distraction go for the lower cup, but man city can't play in the EFL trophy for example). 5 midweek slots and the finals over the course of a long weekend please.

Continental tournament is more tricky to fit in especially with Euro2021 to play from June. Could it be postponed for 2020/21 season but guarantee any qualified team their place for next season. Potentially that means like 8 Premier League teams in the Champions League (unlikely though), extra qualifiers could be played nationally? Or make it a 5 team group for the season to create extra spaces.

Tldr; 

* National Leagues and cups from ???? to October.
* Champions League and playoffs in November.
* League starts January (Dec 26th in England).
* 19 game season til May.
* Neutral grounds
* No playoffs
* One cup contest per team (top ranked teams to choose) 64 teams in each of 4 cups 
* Champions League 2021 - sack it off.",2,1585444491,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fqwxfe/how_to_finish_the_european_season_premier_league/,soccer,0

fquqhx,yiyiyiyi,r/soccer rules and moderation during Covid-19,"Hi everyone,

As you know we loosened the rules on r/soccer with the cancellation of football across the globe. That was fine for a while but we've been a bit inconsistent with our approach.  

There isn't much to talk about so we want to open up the rules a bit, but at the same time keep things orderly and we're not just seeing the same things posted over and over. We've also had to regroup as mods so we're all acting in the same way.

Rules in place for now:

**1. We're relaxing the 5 year anniversary rule for clips, you can post goals from any year, but they should be ""on this day"".**

**2. Titles must be formatted with goalscorer, score, opposition and context, e.g. ""Ronaldinho free against England (2-1) in the 2002 World Cup quater final"", and not ""Legendary Ronaldino free kick against England""**

**3. Not a new rule but please don't use sarcastic or joke titles. Make sure you fairly describe the content of the post, or it will be removed.**

As a guideline, please try to post significant goals. Goals that changed the result in a game, goals from an important match, or otherwise have some historical significance. 

That's all for now, but we're open for feedback on these and any other ideas you have for the sub during this time.",70,1585436621,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fquqhx/rsoccer_rules_and_moderation_during_covid19/,soccer,16

fqpghg,Inter_Mirifica,"There's still some kind of live football going on this weekend, but with flying cars ! Little guide of the NA Regionals (starting at 8pm CET).","**Edit : first match-up between NRG and Soniqs live now ! on https://twitch.tv/rocketleague (or on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdKuPY64fEpI4cdlBSyvEJw)).** (and if you prefer, there's a french cast by [Rocket Baguette](http://www.twitch.tv/rocketbaguette)) 

Seeing the completely unexpected success of my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fj5di7/bar√ßa_is_actually_playing_against_as_monaco/? utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) here about Rocket League and Monaco vs Bar√ßa, I thought people could be interested in a little guide for the most important event of the season, the Regionals (NA version) happening in a few hours. 

At least it's some kind of football, right ? Even if it's esports, there still isn't any live football going on (minus in Belarus). So maybe you'll be interested in this as a temporary replacement. And since it's online (and the casters have been moved to cast from their home as well) it won't stop. I'll help you with a little presentation of the game, the event, the teams (compared to real football teams), and their players (identified to their real player counterpart) 

# The game

For those who don't know it, *Rocket League* is a fast paced football game, played 3v3 in a closed arena, and where players are rocket powered cars that can fly. It seems goofy described like that, but there's actually a lot of depth in the game with the real 3rd dimension created by the flying cars, and the fact that you can't fly indefinitely (you need to pick up boosts around the pitch to fill your tank). Depth that is followed by real intensity that makes the game an incredible esport to watch with very few idle time during the play. One of the only rules is that the ""legs"" (series are usually played in best of 7, with each leg lasting 5 minutes) doesn't end once the 5 minutes are over, it ends when the ball touches the ground after that. Which result in increased tension, and legendary moments like this [goal] (https://m.twitch.tv/clip/HonestPlacidKeyboardChefFrank) by Jstn in the season 5 Worlds grandfinals.

# The event

We are now in season 9. After 8 weeks of League play where the 10 best teams in North America battled it out, the 6 best teams in the standings will face off in a playoffs bracket to crown the NA Regional Champion. The¬† playoff [bracket](https://imgur.com/a/ek9MG76) is a bit weird, but it's because its usual role is to find the 4 best teams of the region that will represent NA in the World Championship. With the Worlds canceled (yes, even esports events are concerned), the Regionals will be *the* premier event of the season, and had their prizepool readjusted with ~$100k for the winning team.

# The teams

**6th, [Ghost Gaming](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Ghost_Gaming)**(*regular season : 5-4*), aka *Atalanta*. They finished 6th, but are not to be underestimated. Much like Atalanta, they are one of the fastest team in the world, with an all out playstyle they can literally beat any team on their day. 

Player to watch : *Massimo [Atomic](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Atomic) Franceschi (16, United States), aka Josip Ilicic*. He's the one both creating and finishing plays much like the slovenian veteran, with incredible speed, control and decision making.

**5th, [Cloud 9](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Cloud9)**(*regular season 5-4*), aka *Manchester United*. World Champions in season 6, they have been trying to regain their former glory since, like United. They also play mostly in counter attacks resembling the United of OGS in that aspect too. Another team that can beat anyone on their day. 

Player to watch : *Jesus [Gimmick](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Gimmick) Parra (19, United States), aka Marcus Rashford*. If he's on, the team is on. It's as simple as that. He is this season NA's golden striker with 0.88 goals per game, and his striking abilities are not in question much like the English forward. However his inconsistency this season could be dangerous for his team. 

**4th, [NRG Esports](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/NRG_Esports)**(*regular season : 6-3*), aka *Real Madrid*. Current World Champions, they are the juggernaut of NA Rocket League. With an all star roster (including the only European player playing in NA), and a solid playstyle this season that makes them quite similar to the Spanish giant. They were demotivated when the cancelation of Worlds happened, but you shouldn't be fooled they are still one of the favorites to win. 

Player to watch : *Justin [Jstn](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Jstn) Morales (17, United States) aka Eden Hazard*. In the discussion for best player in the world like the Belgian winger at his peak, 2nd of the golden striker award with 0.85 goals per game. He's a very flashy player, with incredible speed and car/ball control and can create magic out of pretty much any plays. 

**3rd, [Susquehanna Soniqs](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Susquehanna_Soniqs)**(*regular season : 6-3*) aka *Atletico de Madrid*. Complete surprise to see them this high in the standings when they just promoted from the 2nd division, the RLRS. But they are applying what made the success of Simeone's Atletico in RL, solid defense with very few mistakes and offense mainly based on quick counter attacks, and it's working. They aren't counted among the favorites but with their underdog status that they learned to love they could still go all the way. 

Player to watch : *Nathan [Shock](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Shock) Frommelt (20, United States), aka Saul Niguez*. A solid all around player, 3rd in the savior of the season award with 2.16 saves per game. Essential to his team like the Spanish midfielder, almost always doing the right choices in defense or in attack. 

**2nd, [G2 Esports](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/G2_Esports)**(*regular season 6-3*), aka *FC Barcelona*. Accostumed to the higher places in the standings, G2 is known for their attacking and suffocative playstyle based mainly on passing plays. However, much like the Catalan institution in recent times, they are quite vulnerable to counter attacks and their passing plays can be sterile sometimes. They haven't won a single Regional Championship yet, but will still be strong contenders once again. 

Player to watch : *Jacob [Jknaps](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Jknaps) Knapman (20, Canada), aka Ousmane Dembele*. Often called the Knapsack for his ability to carry the team on his back, he's however quite inconsistent which can be linked to the Frenchman and his injuries. When he's on, he's undoubtedly one of the best players in the world, an impossible to stop attacking threat. He won the playmaker of the season award with 0.74 assists per game. 

**1st, [Spacestation Gaming](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Spacestation_Gaming)**(*regular season 8-1*), aka *Bayern Munich*. They are becoming a new NA giant after their second season in a row finishing in the top 2 of the standings. Their team is often described as being better collectively than the sum of its parts, with a consistent playstyle that can transform into a very pleasant to watch attacking style. Which is quite similar to the German giant. They are of course one of the favorites to take the trophy home. 

Player to watch : *Alexandre [Axb](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Axb) Bellemare (24, Canada), aka Thiago Alcantara*. He's not as flashy as his teammates, but he's the rock this whole collective is build upon, and a big reason as to why SSG is such a solid team. He also is at the start of all those attacks much like the Spanish midfielder. He often is the one finishing their long moments of attacking pressure.",13,1585419684,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fqpghg/theres_still_some_kind_of_live_football_going_on/,soccer,54

fqgteb,LaRedencion,"The History of you‚Äôll never walk alone - Celtic, Liverpool, Dortmund and many others","The song has come to particular prominence during the corona virus crisis as the unofficial song in solidarity with health workers around the world. Originally a song in the musical Carousel way back in 1945 it has been adopted by various football clubs around the world. 

Celtic and Liverpool both claim to have sung it first. There are even some historical accounts that it was originally sung by Manchester United in homage to the tragedy of the Munich air disaster and later adopted by Liverpool when covered by Jerry and the Pacemakers. A band from Liverpool. 

It then made its way across Europe following Celtics European cup win in 1967. A team know as the Lisbon lions. European clubs such as Dortmund and Milan have been known to sing it since then too. Even my club Leganes have sung it before!

Whether it was Manchester United or Liverpool to sing it first there seems little doubt that it has been ‚Äòwidely‚Äô sung by Celtic fans for the longest time and of all the places I‚Äôve seen it sung it‚Äôs Celtic Park where it gets my spine tingling the most. 

Glad to see it being sung in solidarity across the world and once this awful virus has been dealt with I can see football fans around the world sharing this song and it being belted out at many grounds.",38,1585387307,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fqgteb/the_history_of_youll_never_walk_alone_celtic/,soccer,1

fq9kwr,Cheesebro69,Analysis: Is Arsenal Fan TV More Popular When Arsenal Drops Points?,"# I. Introduction

One of the most treasured past times of online football fandom is the reveling in the post Arsenal loss histrionics of Arsenal fans on AFTV (formerly known as Arsenal Fan TV). We've all seen that Michael Jackson gif eating popcorn posted with the caption ""Waiting for AFTV like"" numerous times on Reddit and Twitter after another mauling by Bayern Munich or dropped points to a lower table side.

The accusation that AFTV feeds off of and profits from Arsenal's failures is the channel's most prominent criticism, one that was made by Arsenal right-back [Hector Bellerin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7H47Gm430). The channel's notoriety has led to [national press coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/sports/arsenal-fan-tv.html), [debates on Sky Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y949KmE_9mk) and a [sitdown discussion between channel founder Robbie Lyle and along with some channel regulars with United legend and current pundit Gary Neville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmgVPi_YQ7E). Robbie does not shy away from this criticism and [issued an 18-minute response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V7pxJ2UUQ) to Bellerin's remarks.

Now AFTV and its cast of characters may not be your cup of tea, but it is impossible to deny the tenacity and fortitude of their support. As far as I can tell, they show up to every Arsenal match including [3-0 League cup losses against on a weekday against a Championship side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta4hfPN3fdI&amp;list=PLub7sJmces1QoX2SRSgopb-qJNlJAyDGn), [far-flung Europa League matches that are a nightmare to coordinate travel for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCuOGHZvGgk), and [pre-season tournaments on the other side of the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJWuM8MXi0M). In my personal opinion, I think they're a net positive. If you can get past the bluster, you'll find content that engages in [serious analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsmBNbnKcmw) from a diverse array of voices.

Despite AFTV's rebuttals to its criticism, I don't believe it's unfair to say their videos, particularly the post-match fan cams, are more popular after Arsenal drops points. If you take a look at [their most popular videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBTy8j2cPy6zw68godcE7MQ/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid), you'll see that nine of the twelve most viewed videos are post-match rants.

However, if we're going to confirm this hypothesis then it will require a robust statistical analysis of quality data. Given my skills as a data analyst, my extra free time, and the current Covid-19 no rules shitposting spirit of Reddit, I have volunteered abilities for this undertaking. What follows is my research into answering this question that includes my descriptions of my methodology and interpretations backed by stats and charts. What better way to spend your time stuck in your home than reading this glorified shitpost?

# II. Data Acquisition and Construction

The first step in any data analysis project is getting the data and cleaning it. This was a project I thought about doing for a while, but never got around to completing because of the massive hurdle of getting the YouTube views data. That was until I came across the [YouTube API python package](https://youtube-data-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which makes it incredibly easy to pull data on the AFTV channel and its videos.

A significant initial step to check off was to find a way to only grab post-match videos (fan cams and the day after discussions). There was no way I was gonna sift the 12000k+ videos and manually pick out the ones I needed but luckily for me, AFTV organizes their videos in playlists. Playlists containing the kind of videos I was seeking typically include the score in the title i.e [""Arsenal 1-0 West Ham (07/03/2020)""](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLub7sJmces1QlIaSjzCw26jfqj3jlw3Nf) or they say ""Arsenal vs Club X"". 

Here's a quick rundown the data preparation from acquisition to cleaning.

1. Download data on all 530 AFTV playlists. Use regex and a bit of manual inspection to keep the 349 playlists containing post-match videos because those playlists's titles mention the match.
2. Now I have a list of the videos I want to collect data on, so I pass that into the API's search function, which returns data such as video title, video description, views count, publish date, likes counts, dislikes counts, comment count, tags, and more. 
3. FYI Google imposes what's known as a rate limit which basically means there's a cap on the amount of data I can download per day, so that meant I had to stretch this process over the course of 5 days.
4. Next up, tagging videos by season and match result. Using the publish date of the playlist, I could easily mark down their season. For match result, I was able to code a third of playlists with their result because the score is in their name, but for the other two-thirds I had to manually tag myself‚Äînot as bad as it sounds. And if you're wondering, I opted against tagging the match competition of the additional burden.
5. The final step involved joining the playlist data with the video data so that each video could be tagged with a season and match result.
6. This was an arduous process (certainly harder than what I deal with at work) and I did my best to construct a decent sized and unbiased (statistically speaking) dataset. Please share your feedback on my process in the comments below.

My finalized dataset features rich clean data on 6255 videos spanning seven seasons. Now for the fun part!!

# III. Analysis.

The most important tool in my arsenal (pun intended) is what's known as a t-test, which is a common tool used in statistics to decide if one collection of numbers is greater or less than another collection of numbers‚Äîsee where this is going. It's by no means a perfect method and has its own valid criticisms but this is a shit post and it's not like I'm trying to prove if an unproven treatment for Covid-19 actually works.

Before we get to the main course, let me present some summary stats and exploratory data analysis that answers some of the basic and obvious questions you'd expect.

The average video gets about 76,239 hits, but that doesn't tell the full picture because of the channel's growth over the years so let's visualize the average hits per season along with the number of videos per season.

https://preview.redd.it/firndffj4bp41.png?width=1439&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1a0db23a903f9b5ec03fd1d6be732bb42d132bc

As you can see AFTV has demonstrated considerable growth in its popularity since its early days‚Äîjump in hits from 15-16 to 16-17 stands out. The red chart on the right indicates I need to factor seasons into my analysis.

In the initial step towards confirm or dispelling our hypothesis let's visualize video data by match results.

https://preview.redd.it/z4zma4p25bp41.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2d136210cb1405b42daf89586605652d48e43eb

It appears we have a smoking gun(ner)!! The average number of hits from videos produced after defeats is almost twice that of draws and more than double than wins. 

Let's see if the t-tests support this assessment. In the following table, I lay out the results of my three t-tests which evaluated: win hits vs draw hits, win hits vs loss hits, and draw hits vs loss hits. If you need a quick t-test lesson, I recommend this [video from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/two-sample-inference/two-sample-t-test-means/v/two-sample-t-test-for-difference-of-means). 

&amp;#x200B;

|**Test**|**Diff of Means\***|**t-Statistic**|**pvalue\*\***|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Win Hits vs Draw Hits|\-12684.40|\-3.174|*0.0015*|
|Win Hits vs Loss Hits|\-77728.15|\-12.30|*2.435e-33*|
|Draw Hits vs Loss Hits|\-65043.75|\-9.021|*3.73e-19*|

\* Difference in the mean hits between one category of hits and determined by their order under the test column, i.e. average hits for wins is 12684.40 less than that of draws.

\*\* All significant values italicized 

Voila! I have ~~proven that Arsenal's failure causes AFTV to be popular~~ demonstrated that the differences in the three types of hits are not due to random chance, this is essentially what the pvalues are telling us. The 0.0015 number in the top right in stats terms means there is a 0.15% chance that draws accumulating more hits than wins is due to random chance and since all three pvalues are below 0.05 (a commonly used threshold to determine significance) we can say that all three relationships are significant.

But we're not done yet! Remember what I said about seasons. Let's go ahead and visualize average hits by season and conduct a round of t-tests for all seven seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9ivqrokmap41.png?width=2840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f066b7e47d4c4632dc7eb8f51f2fe4b4a9760084

Post-loss videos being more popular than draw and win videos is a consistent trend for all seven seasons, putting us one step closer to answering this project's thesis. Now if you're like me, averages are not quite satisfying enough and you want to know what the distributions looks like. Thats why I've created a version of this visualization but with boxplots that represent a collection of hits for a season and match results. And of course, Khan Academy has got you covered on [boxplots](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/box-whisker-plots/a/box-plot-review).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxhkotjinap41.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=529b430683b4b5f95dc02d6dd517b21cf9abf338

For the purpose of visual ease, I switched to use a log scale for the views, please remember that when digesting the results. This more holistic view of the data provides solid support for my assessment that losses are generally associated with higher view counts. 

Now for the t-tests. The following table replicates the same methodology and results as the previous table but for each season. All values presented are rounded and significant pvalues italicized.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Seasons**|**W vs D Mean Diff**|**W vs D T-Stat**|**W vs D Pvalue**|**W vs L Mean Diff**|**W vs L T-Stat**|**W vs L Pvalue**|**D v L Mean Diff**|**D vs L T-Stat**|**D vs L Pvalue**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|13-14|\-1166|\-0.81|0.42|\-23147|\-3.58|*&lt;0.001*|\-21981|\-3.35|*&lt;0.001*|
|14-15|\-2978|\-1.51|0.13|\-22994|\-3.91|*&lt;0.001*|\-20016|\-3.27|*0.001*|
|15-16|\-9860|\-2.52|*0.01*|\-21346|\-4.72|*&lt;0.001*|\-11485|\-2.10|*0.03*|
|16-17|\-22324|\-1.01|0.31|\-171.1k|\-7.49|*&lt;0.001*|\-148.8k|\-4.74|*&lt;0.001*|
|17-18|4764.|0.59|0.55|\-108.1k|\-5.61|*&lt;0.001*|\-112.8k|\-5.71|*&lt;0.001*|
|18-19|3018|0.35|0.72|\-66033|\-5.2|*&lt;0.001*|\-69051|\-4.81|*&lt;0.001*|
|19-20|\-49302|\-4.07|*&lt;0.001*|\-97886|\-5.23|*&lt;0.001*|\-48583|\-2.3|*0.02*|

I know this is a lot of numbers to throw at you but the big takeaway here is that for every season, **the hits for post-loss videos are significantly greater than that of both post-win and post-draw videos.**

# IV. Conclusion

Given this exhaustive analysis, I believe the evidence demonstrates that Arsenal Fan TV generates more hits after Arsenal drops points. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is that the rest of us non-Arsenal fans enjoy their post-loss meltdowns. The data suggest that AFTV's success is fueled in part by Arsenal's failure.

Thank you for indulging me, I've spent way more time than I needed to working on this ridiculous project. 

There are plenty more ways you can analyze this data and I'd love to hear suggestions in the comments below, especially if you have ideas for a regression analysis. 

And FYI I did run the same analysis for comments, likes, and dislikes and just like the results above, pretty much all those metrics are greater post-loss.

I would also appreciate any constructive criticisms or interrogations of my process as well. 

I'll be hand in the comments later if you have any questions that can be quickly and easily answered.

Cheers everyone and remember to do your part by staying home!!!

# V. Bonus

Here are the average hits by AFTV characters in case you were interested.

**Some notes** 

Teams in italics have already qualified for their position due to the schedule of their league (winning the 2019 season of their league)

The spot for the Champions League title holder was given to Real Madrid because they have the highest UEFA Club Coefficient of team left in the competition
	
The spot for the Europa League title holder was given to Manchester United because they have the highest UEFA Club Coefficient of any team left in the competition

Because the CL title spot was given to a team that qualified through their domestic league (Real Madrid) the following changes were made (according to UEFA rules):	

- Association 11 (Netherlands) champions (Ajax) moved into the group stage

- Association 13 (Czech Republic) champions (Slavia Prague) moved into the play-off round

- Association 15 (Croatia) champions (Dinamo Zagreb) moved into the third qualifying round

- Association 18 (Cyprus) and Association 19 (Serbia) champions (Omonia Nicosia and Crvena Zvezda) moved into the second qualifying round",2,1585340130,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fq4q80/what_the_202021_champions_league_would_look_like/,soccer,1

fpy0ww,red2505randombx,"If the current season is cancelled, money is officially more important than the actual football.","First of all, my thoughts and prayers go out to anyone effected by Covid-19 in these awful times for everyone. I‚Äôm fully aware that people are losing their lives at the moment and this football season is far from the biggest of our worries right now, however I feel this needs to be discussed.

Before I get into it, yes I‚Äôm a Liverpool fan. Do not be mistaken this is not a biased view. I‚Äôm concerned about the game we all love being ruled by billionaire owners. This is only the first step.

I‚Äôve been listening to TalkSport who are reporting today that the PFA, FA and Premier League are currently discussing how to move forward, there have been suggestions that a few clubs are pushing to have the season be determined as ‚Äònull and void‚Äô in an attempt to save money. 

Now we all know that football has become more of a business than a sport over the past couple of decades or so (particularly the Premier League) with huge investments being made each year to provide us all with a product we love watching week in week out, however it now seems like this investment has overtaken the importance of the product.

The fact some teams are even entertaining the idea of this internally is sickening to me as a FOOTBALL fan and it is now clearer than ever that the owners of these clubs are ONLY concerned about their own pockets! 

This completely disregards the efforts of any of the staff, players, groundsmen etc. from every club in the country. All of the time, effort, blood, sweat and tears that have been dedicated to this campaign by staff, players, groundsmen, will all go to waste. It was all done for nothing.

Not only that, voiding the current season is disrespectful to us as fans. The investment WE have made in buying tickets, shirts, travelling to games, the countless hours of arranging trips, various sports channels and Amazon Prime to follow our teams throughout the season will no doubt be forgotten in all this. 

As long as the owners get their money, it will all be ok though, I guess?

I‚Äôm very interested in what everyone thinks on this. Do you think the importance of money has outgrown the actual football itself?",15,1585319959,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fpy0ww/if_the_current_season_is_cancelled_money_is/,soccer,1

fpvnbp,Lord_Slong,Could this be the answer.,"Right I've been trying to think of a way that this mess is all sorted and I've came up with something I haven't seen mentioned so here goes. If the virus is gone and we're good to go in let's say August or September, why not play the Euros then? That'll end in October. Give the players a few weeks off, they come back and play the remaining cup competitions that each team are in: Champions League, Europa and domestic cups. That'll wrap up around February let's say. Then give the players a bit of time off and resume every league the way we left them this March. The league gets finished, relegation and promotions are sorted, Cup completions are finished and then the new season will begin in the August.

fpsxlx,toomuchscruff,An analysis on how Leicester winning the Premier League changed the performance of the Big 6 in unprecedented fashion.,"In the 2015-2016 season, Leicester City pulled off one of the greatest sporting shocks of all time and won the league, however, it could be argued that this was only because of performances by the rest of the big 6 that could be best described as drab. 

Since this season however, the top 6 placed positions in this league have all been occupied by the Big 6, furthermore, with the exception of Klopp (who was hired in that season), each team has changed their manager since then ‚Äì some multiple times, the most recent change being Arsenal with the recruitment of Arteta. Maybe this could be attributed to a large injection of money into these clubs or maybe it was the embarrassment experienced by getting shown up by a small Italian deemed to be a failure who goes by the name Ranieri. 

**Amount the top six clubs in the 4 seasons before and after Leicester won the league spent:** 

|Team|Money spent 4 seasons before|Money spent 4 seasons after|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arsenal|¬£225.66m|¬£383.11m|
|Chelsea|¬£421.43m|¬£582.39m|
|Liverpool|¬£365.97m|¬£401.74m|
|Manchester City|¬£440.06m|¬£698.77m|
|Manchester United|¬£454.45m|¬£612.09m|
|Tottenham Hotspur|¬£283.73m|¬£318.15m|

In this it clearly demonstrates a much higher expenditure by all of these clubs post Leicester, which correlates in the better form of some of these clubs as said above. Let's not read too far into this however as Chelsea and Manchester United have had high performance fluctuations, as well as Arsenal and Spurs haven't had too much of a change of form since then although coincidentally that season, behind Leicester, they were respectively second and [third](https://www.offthepost.info/blog/2016/10/photo-leicester-fans-prepare-banner-mocking-tottenham-finishing-behind-arsenal/). As well as that Man City and Liverpool have improved the most; you may have notice each of the two clubs contrasted per scenario here seem to have quite different spending habits which makes me believe this metric in this case is kind of dumb. 

Some other avenue to explore is the managerial change, and the best way to look at that will be in average points per game, although that can often be pretty dodgy. Arsenal are probably the best to demonstrate this, as if we go from Wenger to Emery they have a very similar PPG of 1.98 to 1.85 respectively, but the longevity of each compared to the money they had to spend combined then with all the other factors such as league standard make it impossible to get an accurate comparison, and then this would be even harder if considering Arteta. 

Regarding that however, a good comparison can be made between Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, all of whom signed at a similar time, Klopp in October of that incredible season and Guardiola and Conte signed in the summer following this. 

Really the next season was remembered for [Payet on a mad one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx4n9q9S3S4) and for [Can scoring the best goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WHBKQExJmg) I've ever seen live, but the most notable thing that actually happened in that time was the first instance of a team in 9 seasons with an over 90 point finish. Moreover, this was just the spark which then followed with 2 more seasons of incredible domination by Manchester City starting with the first ever instance of the Centurions, followed by an incredibly tight season last year, with Liverpool finishing 2nd with a points total that would have won every other season but the previous one; however, they probably won't mind too much as they won the champions league due to the heroics of [Origi](https://youtu.be/7mWBaFBb5Ls?t=800).

You should not count out this season either, as prior to the COVID-19 suspension Liverpool were almost certainly going to obliterate the record points total and almost went unbeaten if it wasn't for this [gent](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watford_FC/comments/fbhbfi/possibly_the_greatest_player_of_all_time/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). 

Hence it seems that these managers have all brought that special something that if compared to the quality of the mangers in the league beforehand is quite a significant leap. Each of these managers were all significantly proven in their own right beforehand, and their quality unseen in the league for quite some time, that can be demonstrated quite well by this from [Mourinho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OCA_yOn9hE). 

Rest assured, there are other factors that haven't been considered, such as the performance of the other 14 and how it's taken until now for them to shine, the inflation and net-spend for money in the table above which may have significant implications on it's usefulness, as well as Capoue being criminally underrated even though he is a top 5 dm in the league both statistically and in all [passing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gua9VPalcIg)  and [skill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmW3JSex82Y) [compilations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRt5Na7BMQs). 

On the whole we can conclude that the Big 6 spent a crap-ton more in general, changed their managers a bunch and improved (in some cases) ‚Äì but really the best thing you can get from this is the double acrostics of this post.",13,1585295204,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fpsxlx/an_analysis_on_how_leicester_winning_the_premier/,soccer,1

My friends and I are sports fiends and are in need of some good sports to watch. We're looking for great games (matches?) that we don't know the outcome to. None of us are big soccer (football?) fans, so it's ideal for us in this scenario. 

Share the best soccer matches you know of, and please do not post the final score. Playoff, world cup, or high stakes games are preferred (if it's a world cup game, ideally not a game with the winner of the world cup. We know most of the world cup winners).

**If you share, please post the link to the game!**

fpjbdq,Cahootie,The Curious Case of Brommapojkarna - Sweden's talent factory and the dark side of one of Europe's foremost academies,"Earlier today 17-year-old [Johan Guadagno](https://www.transfermarkt.com/johan-guadagno/profil/spieler/605427) signed [his first professional contract with Manchester United](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-hoogewerf-transfer-news-17985971). Since joining the club this summer he has only been on the bench for the two games in the U18 Premier League, but the coaches have decided that he will is part of their plans for the future, which United scout in Sweden/Director of Sports at Brommapojkarna Tommy S√∂destr√∂m may have played a part in.

After a stellar season with Parma 19-year-old [Dejan Kulusevski](https://www.transfermarkt.com/dejan-kulusevski/profil/spieler/431755) was announced as [Juventus new ‚Ç¨35 million signing](https://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2020/dejan-kulusevski-joins-juventus.php) in early January. The versatile offensive midfielder is joining a club in need of rejuvenating their midfield, which leaves the door open for him to fight for a spot in the squad.

Back in November 18-year-old [Jack Lahne](https://www.transfermarkt.com/jack-lahne/profil/spieler/493674) made his debut for Amiens SC with a 82nd minute substitution, and four minutes later he scored [his first goal for the club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvHsOMQrsXc). He is now [back in Sweden on a loan deal with √ñrebro SK](https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/allsvenskan/officiellt-jack-lahne-atervander-till-allsvenskan---pa-lan/)^^[SE], but is seen as one of Sweden's biggest talents currently looking for playing time.

-

What do these players all have in common? They've found success with different teams in different countries, but all three have a background in [IF Brommapojkarna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IF_Brommapojkarna). Located in one of the more affluential suburbs of Stockholm the club isn't known for its success on a senior level. Last season they faced their second straight relegation after hovering between the first and second tier of Swedish football, and also between a 500 and 2000 average attendance, for 20 years.

Instead, Brommapojkarna's claim to fame is their academy. Europe's largest football club, with 260 teams and over 4000 players, has proven time and time again that is it able to churn out players who are able to move to bigger clubs both in Sweden and abroad. Looking at players who are currently active, this list includes players such as:

Now you're probably asking yourself how all of this is possible. Althought Sweden is currently facing a revolution with a plethora of young players looking to make a splash on the world stage (Alexander Isak, Benjamin Nygren, Mattias Svanberg, Ryan Johansson) it is not currently known as a powerhouse of football, so one single club shouldn't be able to produce such talent. While the tale of Brommapojkarna seems like a miracle, there are darker sides to it.

-

About a year ago the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published [a series of articles](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/KvV2xo/den-dar-sjuaringen-kommer-kosta-en-formogenhet)^^[SE] about the club. While the general Swedish mentality is that every kid should be able to play football with their friends and sorting kids by ability should be avoided at all cost Brommapojkarna have taken a harsher approach. The club is structured like a pyramid, with multiple independent teams per age group, and the club's goal is to find players for the academy teams starting when the kids are 8 years old.

Leaked documents show that the club is encouraging the parents' of 10-year-old girls to have their kids apply for the academy team with promises of a fast track to possible senior team football, national team appearances and US college options. While this sounds promising, playing for the academy team doesn't come cheap for the parents. [Another article by Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/a2VPEA/chockpris-for-att-spela-fotboll-i-stockholm-15-000-kr-ar)^^[SE] shows that while Malm√∂ FF only charges about ‚Ç¨150 per season the cost for a player in Brommapojkarna's academy teams can reach 10 times as much.

-

While this isn't unique if you compare to the other large Stockholm clubs, and even cheap compared to teams in Europe and the US, Brommapojkarna also have a separate system with ""development teams"". This option is offered to teams that haven't reached the success required for academy teams but still want to compete for that glory, and if the team wants that option the club requires a certain level of practice, presence and coach education. They also require the team to use official club gear, and to add even more cost to the equation, that the team makes use of a professional academy coach.

For the team to do this twice a week for a year the documents show that they will have to pay up to ‚Ç¨630, but sources say that this has now increased to ‚Ç¨900. As an anecdote, back when I played football as a kid there was a father who was very disappointed that his son didn't make the cut for the academy team, so he decided to bankroll his son's team and pay for all of this himself. These teams get preferential treatment when it comes to time allocation and club facilities, but for teams without a sponsor like that it also means that kids whose parents aren't able to afford a team like this end up dropping football altogether.

-

As a result of this merotocratic system from a young age the club culture has developed into a cutthroat environment where young teams will do anything to reach success. Parents have told Aftonbladet that they will recruit players from other teams within the club, ostracize players who don't perform, use older players to win games and pay academy coaches under the table for them to coach the team.

The Swedish Football Association recommend that teams not separate teams by ability before the age of 15, while the same recommentation from the Swedish Sports Confederation is at 12, however [according to Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/1nM6kB/maste-prata-om-foraldrakulturen)^^[SE] there have been many cases where Brommapojkarna start having tryouts for 10-year-olds within the club. These teams are selected after one practice session with one coach, and afterwards the teams almost entire consist of players whose parents have paid for extra practice. Those who didn't make the cut were able to participate in a cup to fight for the spot (which also cost money), but that proved fruitless as the teams had already been selected.

-

Following these investigations the club has enacted some change. Coaches and directors have been fired, new ones have been brought in, policy documents have been created and the organization has been restructured, but even though the club touts this as a step in the right direction parents still say that nothing has changed.

While the maximum annual fees for playing at Brommapojkarna is set at ‚Ç¨1100 that hasn't stopped prices from soaring. One parents claims that he spent ‚Ç¨4 500 for his kid to play football two seasons ago, and to circumvent the limit teams have billed parents directly for clothes and other things that were part of an agreement with the team's sponsors. They go to tournaments and camps in Germany, Denmark, Spain, the Netherland, Turkey and Italy, they pay for extra practice sessions, they pay for private coaching to not fall behind, and the pressure forces parents to pay up.

-

This means that for your child to be able to play for one of Europe's best academies you as a parent must have a certain level of income. Parents of 7-year-olds joke with each other that the better a kid is at playing football, the more expensive it will be for parents. If the parents disagree with the costs or the harsh treatment of their child some parents have said that they are forced to be a lickass or be brought in to a meeting where coaches lambaste them with threats aimed at silencing dissent. Leaked documents from 2018 call the club totalitarian with a culture of silence.

This situation is only made worse by the culture among the parents. According to sources some parents are pushing kids and coaches to favor their child in the belief that their child will be the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and they will do anything to make sure their child has an advantage. If you disagree with anything it will not only affect you, other parents will also target your child.

[The club has acknowledged](https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/1nM6kB/maste-prata-om-foraldrakulturen)^^[SE] that in order to change the club culture something has to be done with the parent culture, but at the same time Brommapojkarna's success means that these parents will keep pushing their children towards the club and won't stop at anything to make sure that their kids succeed.

-

It is a fact that Brommapojkarna has managed to produce incredible talent, with over 60 players currently in professional football, but more and more voices have been raised about the unsustainable model that the club uses. The chances of an individual kid going professional are slim, but for the parents who hope that their child will be the one in a thousand they must open their wallets and hope that the child will play well enough to not be dropped from the team with no considerations.",51,1585255577,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fpjbdq/the_curious_case_of_brommapojkarna_swedens_talent/,soccer,7

fpig6w,yopyompyomper,Analysis: Everton's Performance against Bird and Non-Bird Clubs since Becoming Sponsored by Angry Birds,"*‚ÄúWhat misfortune is ours! We strain every nerve to get to the crows, do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way!‚Äù (Aristophanes, Birds 25-30)*

**Overview:**

In this post I will analyze the relationship between Everton Football Club and birds, specifically angry ones. Before I begin, I wish to preface my analysis with a few orienting remarks.

First off, as a pure-bred American plastic, I had not heard of Everton Football Club until they partnered with the Angry Birds franchise in 2017. Upon learning of this blossoming relationship, a few questions immediately came to mind: what is an Everton? Is Liverpool a real pool of liver or does it simply need rebranding? Why is my healthcare so expensive?

Yet, as I learned more about the long and not-particularly-illustrious history of Everton, I began to see the light. Unfettered from the confines of space and time, revelation came to me as I slept. Today, I seek to share with you this vision I had and to analyze statistically how the partnership between Everton and Angry Birds has impacted their success on the pitch.

**Birds:**

Regardless of our [personal fears and trepidations about birds](https://www.reddit.com/r/bertstrips/comments/5ygluc/one_man_holocaust/), it is an undeniable fact that throughout history, birds have acted as muses of sorts. The scene of a soaring hawk or diving falcon stirs up images of freedom and unrestrained self-determination from deep within our souls. These sensations, [denied for far too long for far too many humans](https://birdsarentreal.com/), have helped contribute to our collective view of avians as representatives of freedom.

Birds act as such heralds of change and liberation, from Noah‚Äôs dove finding dry land to Yeats‚Äô falcon wandering back to its natural state of chaotic liberty to John Keats‚Äô, ‚ÄúOde to a Nightingale,‚Äù which tells the tale of a moribund, bedridden man who witnesses the unrestrained flight of the titular bird, a creature that, ‚Äúwast not born for death.‚Äù

If death represents the restraints and fetters that keep us from our potential and dreams, then the light, free, unrestricted nature of birds is emblematic of life. A truly virtuous life is lived, in the words of the neo-prophetic [Lynyrd Skynyrd](https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/free-bird-2.jpeg), ‚Äúas free as a bird.‚Äù

**Everton:**

Of course, Everton are everything that birds are not. In the words of AC Milan legend Gennaro Gattuso, Everton are ‚Äú[sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJHUbtR0yI8)‚Äù With that being said, any success Everton have found over the last decade has proven unable to combat the utter disappointment and, frankly, depression that has surrounded Goodison Park and the Club at large. Even after spending boatloads of cash in the transfer market to bring in players such as the bird-legged Richarlison, and even after placing their faith in players such as the [bird-armed](https://twitter.com/Islooboy/status/1236658425347571712/photo/1) Jordan Pickford, Everton continue to find themselves utterly grounded by their inability to compete with England‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Six‚Äù and Europe‚Äôs elite clubs.

While birds undoubtedly have come to stand via literary works, popular culture, and patriotic symbolism as harbingers of life and liberty, the blue halogen radiating from the decrepit steel ribcage of Goodison Park communicates a football carcass to the city of Liverpool. Indeed, Everton have died multiple times in the past few years alone: from the frustrating tenure of Marco Silva, to the disappointment Moise Kean has brought, to being crushed under the weight of [Big Sam](https://twitter.com/talksport/status/781072933594787841) and his national team woes. Not even a thick Scouse accent can make Everton Football Club sound like a place for flight, hope, and freedom. However, the question remains as to whether Everton‚Äôs recent deal with Angry Birds has resulted in them becoming more or less bird-like. How have they fared since this momentous deal? Have they been able to rise from the ashes of their past like the Phoenix? Have they been able to compete with the plethora of other avian teams around England, including, but not limited to, the Reds next door?

**Important Dates:**

‚ÄúEverton signed a multi-year shirt sleeve partnership with Rovio Entertainment - the games giant behind the Angry Birds franchise - in Autumn 2017. The Angry Birds logo debuted on the left sleeve of the Everton jersey during the Premier League fixture at Old Trafford against Manchester United on Sunday, 17 September.‚Äù ([https://www.evertonfc.com/club/partners/angry-birds](https://www.evertonfc.com/club/partners/angry-birds))

Within these tables, the 2017-2018 season is missing the first three games (City (A), Chelsea (A), and Tottenham (H)) as the bird patch did not feature in these fixtures but first appeared against Manchester United. It is also worth noting the rather tough schedule that Everton have remaining this season (Liverpool (H), Norwich (A), Leicester (H), Tottenham (A), Southampton (H), Wolves (A), Aston Villa (H), Sheffield (A), Bournemouth (H)). Although both of these erasures do not factor into the averages calculated above, they clearly have some bearing on the critical pts/game metric. With that being said, the missing games constitute a small amount of the total collection, and it can be stated with a relative degree of certainty that Everton have performed *slightly* better overall since donning their bird-garnished kits three Septembers ago.

**Methodology:**

Next, we examined the performance of Everton against avian and non-Avian teams during these two distinct time periods. We defined Avian teams as teams whose mascot is a bird (or bird-like creature) and a list of such teams is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bird Data:**

From 2014-2017, Everton performed far stronger against non-avian teams than their winged competitors: against grounded competition they averaged 1.41 points per game. However, when their opponents could take to the skies, [the Blues got taken down like Sully Sullenberger](https://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_ahttps://user-images.strikinglycdn.com/res/hrscywv4p/image/upload/c_limit,fl_lossy,h_9000,w_1200,f_auto,q_auto/860016/806320_212626.jpeguto,q_auto/860016/806320_212626.jpeg), gaining only 1.14 points per game, a dip of .27 points.

However, from the moment Everton was graced by the sweet wings of the Birds of Anger, they rose to the heavens in a glorious Aristeia (at least against bird teams) and have not yet returned to land. Though Everton‚Äôs points per game against non-bird teams dropped to 1.28, it rose to an astounding 1.47 against their feathered compatiots.

&amp;#x200B;

The ppg differential against avian and non-avian teams is a staggering .46 points. This figure represents the difference between the 1.14 and 1.41 (-.27) from 2014-2017 and the 1.47 and 1.28 (+.19) from 2017-Corona. Using Python, we simulated 1000 cases and in none of them did the change in point differential even approach this .46 figure.

**Conclusion:**

Having established a strong, statistically significant link between success against avian foes and the love and support of Angry Birds, we featherless bipeds are left to wonder how and why. While the universe is rarely so lazy as to allow mere mortals to understand her mysterious ways, in this instance she has not concealed her majestic power with mists of uncertainty. The answer to why Everton gained such strength against flying foes is a simple one: brotherhood. This value is often thoughtlessly spoken of, sometimes by friends with illusions of intimacy, sometimes by warriors, who mistake a shared cause for shared values, and, most notably, by the French. In this case, however, the bond of brotherhood is shared not just among players or fans but by a far broader group: green mammals.

In Angry Birds, the vicious birds attack peace-loving, pastoral, and, critically, green pigs. These pigs are honest creatures who seek nothing more than a quiet existence within their unstable homes. It is the birds, so cruelly angry, who disturb this tranquility. Just as Everton are an affront to the otherwise graceful and beautiful sport of soccer, so too are the birds from Angry Birds a disgrace to their otherwise peaceful species. When Everton players bravely don the words ‚ÄúAngry Birds‚Äù on the side of their kits, it represents more than a simple corporate partnership; it is a reminder of the pain and suffering brought upon peaceful green animals by the anger of the birds.

But why, you might ask, does Everton care more about green mammals than other clubs? A fair question. Of course, the most obvious answer is that the greatest green mammal of them all once proudly dressed himself in blue, gracing the humble residents of the swamp of Merseyside with the [onion-like scent of gritty, working-class-hero skill](https://i1.wp.com/sportal.betxchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Wayne-Rooney-Shrek.jpg?fit=1023%2C681).

However, as all students of Socrates know, just as only the examined life is worth living, only an explanation that necessitates labor and deliberation is worthy of consideration. For this reason, we must seek a further connection between the Blues and the greens. [This advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv09DRd4lsM) for Nike provides perfect evidence. The video features many players, most notable Everton Legend Wayne Rooney (aka Shrek (mammal, green)) and Tim Howard who for a moment becomes the Incredible Hulk. Having played for Everton from 2007-2016, Howard is blue blooded through and through and his transformation into Hulk, who is notably green, burnishes the point that Everton have a greater connection to green creatures, meaning they are more connected to the green pigs from Angry Birds, meaning they are angry at the birds who are mean to the pigs, meaning they are angry at bird teams, which explains their stronger performance after the sponsorship deal began; QED.

To argue that the subsequent success of Everton following their choice to sport the emblem of Rovio‚Äôs flagship game is merely a correlation and not causal is not only farcical, but altogether a disingenuous assault on the discipline of mathematics. To cite the astronomical sums Everton has paid for their players recently as the reason for their success fails to recognize the *source* of such funds, namely, partnerships such as those with Angry Birds. Furthermore, to dilute Everton‚Äôs recent successes to strictly financial factors is an affront to the sport of soccer; in doing so, we, the fans who demand a return to soccer‚Äôs glory days, a time when money appeared in the stadium only as an afterthought, neglect the seismic cultural impact adopting the Angry Birds insignia might have on Everton‚Äôs club culture. Just as the likes of Bernard, Tom Davies, and Mason Holgate are expected to fight for the crest on the front of their shirts, we must expect that they also rally behind the white balloon letters on their left arm. Ultimately, Everton, a club burdened by its own recent history, have taken to the skies and, like the anatomically incorrect avians they so desperately seek to emulate, have won our hearts and minds (along with comparatively more matches).

fp7g5f,Hessenuk,How would a modern manager utilise England's 'Golden Generation',"From 2001-2010 England had what has been described as a great generation of talent, across all of defence, midfield and attack.

GK: David James, Paul Robinson, Ben Foster  
Def: Ashley Cole, Wayne Bridge, John Terry, Sol Campbell, Jamie Carragher, Rio Ferdinand, Ledley King, Gary Neville, Wes Brown  
Mid: Michael Carrick, Owen Hargreaves, Gareth Barry, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Beckham, Paul Scholes (Let's assume he hadn't retired), Joe Cole, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Aaron Lennon, Ashley Young

fp07dt,InappropriateSurname,"Round-Up: Nicaraguan Primera Liga, 25 Mar","The only league seeing any action this week is the Nicaguran Premier League, and although I couldn't find a stream, I followed all the action on LiveScore and god I miss football.

**Deportivo Ocotal 1-2 Real Estel√≠**

Ocotal hadn‚Äôt beaten reigning champions Estel√≠ in any of the last 7 meetings, going back to a 3-0 win back in March 2018. Since then, there‚Äôs been three draws and four Estel√≠ wins, including a 5-0 last time they met. Argentinian Luis Acuna gave Estel√≠ the lead after 28 minutes, but Honduran Leonel Escoto equalized just a couple of minutes later. Estel√≠ took the lead again in the second half, as Nicaraguan international Jorge Betancur slotted in. Fun fact: The town of Ocotal is twinned with Swindon.

**Deportivo Las Sabanas 1-1 Diriang√©n**

Estel√≠ could overtake fierce rivals Diriang√©n if the Caciques lost away to Sabanas, who are playing their first ever season in the top flight. And despite being bottom, Sabanas took the lead through Deybin Reyes after just four minutes. Danilo Zuniga equalized for Diriang√©n in the 39th minute, but couldn‚Äôt find a way through in the second half, dropping valuable points. 

**Chinandega 0-1 Managua**

Managua FC had come off the back of a hard-fought 4-2 win over city rivals Juventus Managua and are fighting Estel√≠ and Diriang√©n at the top of the league. A win could take them top, but it looked like they were going to draw a blank until the 89th minute when Carlos Felix got his fourth of the season, giving all three points to Managua and putting them top of league.

fowi4n,Russian_Bot_Kremlin,Serie A - Latest news,"&gt;Milan loanee Pepe Reina has revealed that he had symptoms of the Coronavirus and the Aston Villa goalkeeper encouraged people to ‚Äúfollow the restrictions‚Äù.

&gt;Milan director Paolo Maldini has assured that he and son Daniel are feeling ‚Äúfine‚Äù and expect to be rid of coronavirus ‚Äúwithin a week‚Äù.

&gt;Lazio are reportedly working on new deals for leading goalscorer Ciro Immobile and goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.

&gt;Napoli have followed Lazio in postponing their return to training as coronavirus continues to grip Italy.

&gt;Former Milan and Fiorentina boss Fatih Terim says he is in ‚Äúgood hands‚Äù after testing positive for coronavirus.
Alejandro Gomez admits Atalanta‚Äôs Champions League match against Valencia at San Siro ‚Äúhas something to do‚Äù with the coronavirus outbreak in Bergamo.

&gt;Former Inter chief Massimo Moratti has, according to the Corriere dello Sport, shown interest in a return to football by taking over Serie B side Cremonese.

&gt;Inter‚Äôs players have shown no coronavirus symptoms and can now leave their homes after a period of self-isolation.

&gt;Lazio spokesperson Arturo Diaconale has hit out at Massimo Cellino, accusing the Brescia owner of ‚Äúthe pot calling the kettle black‚Äù. Cellino recently claimed the Scudetto should be given to Lazio over their insistence on resuming training early, despite the outbreak of coronavirus killing almost 5,000 people in Italy.

fovafk,Yonko36,how to buy tickets for a football game (serious),"Hello Guys

I planned to visit some derbies in the future. ( The Old Firm, Merseyside Derby, the Belgrade Derby... you name it). Im from Switzerland and to buy tickets for a match here is very easy, you can go to the ticketshop 5min before a match and you'll get a ticket. But I guess for popular derbies this won't be the case. Now my question is, is there a way to buy tickets for a soccer match in the Premier League or Bundesliga to a normal price?  Im aware that seasonticket holders don't have to buy tickets for a normal league match (in switzerland at least) and then there's a ticket presale (in the Bundesliga at least). And after this, all tickets are gone. Well... of course I could buy them on Viagogo or some stupid website like that but I'm sorry I don't want to pay 300 Euros for a ticket that costs around 50-70 Euros...

fosqrf,tyleraw15,Brief history of the recent Liverpool/Manchester City rivalry and how they got to this point.,"Liverpool and Man City are both historic clubs in English football however in terms of success they have been miles apart. The cities of Liverpool and Manchester have been rivals since from the Industrial Revolution but on the pitch, Liverpool and Man Utd have always been the big clubs with the famous rivalry. 

Let‚Äôs start in 2013/14, Liverpool are just coming out of the ‚Äòbanter years‚Äô as 2010-2013 were terrible years for Liverpool fans, however with a new owner and Brendan Rodgers now in, Liverpool could be more optimistic. In contrast Man City, backed by their new Abu Dhabi owners, had dramatically won the league in 2011/12 and on paper were the best team in England. With Alex Ferguson retired, Manchester United began their decline and were suddenly not in the title picture. Man City had great side with the likes of Aguero, Yaya Toure and Kompany leading the team in their title charge. Liverpool surprised everyone and were a great free-flowing attacking team however were constantly let down in defence. As they conceded 50 goals. The likes of Gerrard, Suarez and Sturridge almost gave Liverpool their first league title in decades however just fell short of Man City, losing the title by 2 points.  Liverpool were the first and only team to not win the league after scoring 100 league goals.

2014/15 saw Liverpool slip down the table as they failed to replace Suarez and with Sturridge being injured for the season. City finished 2nd however were not really challenging Chelsea for the title.

2015/16 saw Rodgers sacked and Klopp take the helm at Liverpool. Immediately the football improved and despite a low league finish, Liverpool made it to two Finals, losing both. The 2016 league cup final was played between Man City and Liverpool and was won by City on penalties after a 1-1 draw. So far City have taken two trophies from Liverpool in the last few years. Other than the cup, Man City also had a forgetful year, finishing 4th in the league as Leicester won the title.

The 2016/17 season had Liverpool 2nd at Christmas, however poor form in January and February saw them finish 4th. At City, this was the season Pep Guardiola was appointed with him having a decent first season, finishing 3rd in the league with arguably the best squad on paper.

The 2017/18 season is when the City/Liverpool or Pep/Klopp rivalry begins to grow. Man City smashed the league and were 15 points clear at Christmas. More importantly they were still undefeated and there were talks of them going invincible. In January they came up against Liverpool and were beaten 4-3 in one of the great all time premier league games. Later in the season Liverpool and City were drawn against each other in the UCL quarterfinals with City the favourites. Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool stunned City and won 3-0 at Anfield before winning the 2nd leg 2-1, knocking Man City out of the CL before going on to lose the final to Madrid. By the end of the season it was clear to some that City and Liverpool were the two strongest clubs in England. Liverpool finished 4th in the league however this was mainly down to lack of squad depth combined with the Champions League final run meaning points were dropped later on in the season.

In the summer of 2018 Liverpool had a great transfer window, signing Alisson, Fabinho and Keita. This ,as well as having Van Dijk for the full season, made the league title winners anyone‚Äôs guess. Man City has also been freely spending under Pep and still had the best squad on paper. Liverpool and City both had incredible seasons, with City pipping Liverpool to the title by one point. Liverpool amassed 97 points, the third highest ever recorded in the English top flight, with City‚Äôs 98 being the second highest. However despite Man City again denying Liverpool a trophy, Liverpool were able to win the Champions League. At this time Liverpool and Man City arguably have the two best teams in Europe.

The 2019/20 season saw Liverpool pick up where they left off and so far have amassed a 25 point lead over an inconsistent Man City. With Man City seemingly out of Europe next season and Pep‚Äôs future uncertain, we do not know how long this battle will continue. However we should be happy that we were able to witness this recent rivalry and an 18/19 season that will be talked about for decades.",35,1585152024,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fosqrf/brief_history_of_the_recent_liverpoolmanchester/,soccer,1

folu95,tylerw84,Brief history of the recent Liverpool/Man City rivalry and how we got to this point.,"Liverpool and Man City are both historic clubs in English football however in terms of success they have been miles apart. The cities of Liverpool and Manchester have been rivals since from the Industrial Revolution but on the pitch, Liverpool and Man Utd have always been the big clubs with the famous rivalry. 

Let‚Äôs start in 2013/14, Liverpool are just coming out of the ‚Äòbanter years‚Äô as 2010-2013 were terrible years for Liverpool fans, however with a new owner and Brendan Rodgers now in, Liverpool could be more optimistic. In contrast Man City, backed by their new Abu Dhabi owners, had dramatically won the league in 2011/12 and on paper were the best team in England. With Alex Ferguson retired, Manchester United began their decline and were suddenly not in the title picture. Man City had great side with the likes of Aguero, Yaya Toure and Kompany leading the team in their title charge. Liverpool surprised everyone and were a great free-flowing attacking team however were constantly let down in defence. As they conceded 50 goals. The likes of Gerrard, Suarez and Sturridge almost gave Liverpool their first league title in decades however just fell short of Man City, losing the title by 2 points.  Liverpool were the first and only team to not win the league after scoring 100 league goals.

2014/15 saw Liverpool slip down the table as they failed to replace Suarez and with Sturridge being injured for the season. City finished 2nd however were not really challenging Chelsea for the title.

2015/16 saw Rodgers sacked and Klopp take the helm at Liverpool. Immediately the football improved and despite a low league finish, Liverpool made it to two Finals, losing both. The 2016 league cup final was played between Man City and Liverpool and was won by City on penalties after a 1-1 draw. So far City have taken two trophies from Liverpool in the last few years. Other than the cup, Man City also had a forgetful year, finishing 4th in the league as Leicester won the title.

The 2016/17 season had Liverpool 2nd at Christmas, however poor form in January and February saw them finish 4th. At City, this was the season Pep Guardiola was appointed with him having a decent first season, finishing 3rd in the league with arguably the best squad on paper.

The 2017/18 season is when the City/Liverpool or Pep/Klopp rivalry begins to grow. Man City smashed the league and were 15 points clear at Christmas. More importantly they were still undefeated and there were talks of them going invincible. In January they came up against Liverpool and were beaten 4-3 in one of the great all time premier league games. Later in the season Liverpool and City were drawn against each other in the UCL quarterfinals with City the favourites. Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool stunned City and won 3-0 at Anfield before winning the 2nd leg 2-1, knocking Man City out of the CL before going on to lose the final to Madrid. By the end of the season it was clear to some that City and Liverpool were the two strongest clubs in England. Liverpool finished 4th in the league however this was mainly down to lack of squad depth combined with the Champions League final run meaning points were dropped later on in the season.

In the summer of 2018 Liverpool had a great transfer window, signing Alisson, Fabinho and Keita. This ,as well as having Van Dijk for the full season, made the league title winners anyone‚Äôs guess. Man City has also been freely spending under Pep and still had the best squad on paper. Liverpool and City both had incredible seasons, with City pipping Liverpool to the title by one point. Liverpool amassed 97 points, the third highest ever recorded in the English top flight, with City‚Äôs 98 being the second highest. However despite Man City again denying Liverpool a trophy, Liverpool were able to win the Champions League. At this time Liverpool and Man City arguably have the two best teams in Europe.

The 2019/20 season saw Liverpool pick up where they left off and so far have amassed a 25 point lead over an inconsistent Man City. With Man City seemingly out of Europe next season and Pep‚Äôs future uncertain, we do not know how long this battle will continue. However we should be happy that we were able to witness this recent rivalry and an 18/19 season that will be talked about for decades.",1,1585119476,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/folu95/brief_history_of_the_recent_liverpoolman_city/,soccer,1

Some of these are very safe, some of these are super out there, but all are things that I genuinely believe could happen. Obviously since there are 65 I'm not gonna put them all here, but I'll happily explain any of the wilder predictions in the comments

fohr5o,clees07,When would the Premier League need to recommence in order to finish this season?,"Currently the Premier League season is postponed till April 30 at the earliest.

The next season is scheduled to commence on 8 August. Given that the Euros are now scheduled for the end of next season, it seems difficult in the extreme to push this date back anymore than probably two weeks (if that). 

The players would need at least four weeks of rest before the start of next season, and there remains the risk of restarting but not finishing (for example if a further outbreak was to occur), meaning the possibility of an extended 22 team league next season (I.e. two teams promoted but no team relegated). 

This seems to point to the need to finish this season by mid-July at the absolute latest (even that is a long stretch)

All teams have either 8 or 9 games remaining. The FA may cancel the FA Cup, however they still need to factor in Europe League games for Wolves and United and at least one Champions League game for Chelsea (would need to make allowances for a massive Chelsea comeback, however unlikely). This means they would need probably at least 6 weeks of the season to finish. This would mean that they need to recommence by the start of June at the absolute latest, though logistically probably by mid-May at the latest.

Based upon current modelling of the Covid 19 in Aus (sorry, I‚Äôm keeping track of the Aus data much more than the UK), if 9 in 10 people totally self isolate it is projected to take 50 days to eradicate. The UK will take longer as their numbers are much higher. At 8/10 people it will be 100 days plus (and at 7 basically we don‚Äôt stop the pandemic - seriously stay at home ppl!!!!). 

Best case scenario at 9/10 ppl it will take the UK, I‚Äôm guessing, 75 days to get cases down to 0. Then you need at least a couple of weeks to be certain and to prevent another outbreak. Call that 90 days. This takes us to the end of June, already after a month after the season would have needed to restart

TL;DR Even at best case projections it looks almost impossible that the Premier League recommences for this season. However if you want any hope of watching any more Premier League for the season please stay at home at all times!!! (Seriously, this cannot be stressed am enough. Save lives by staying at home everyone).",18,1585100312,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fohr5o/when_would_the_premier_league_need_to_recommence/,soccer,1

fobvjq,SirPepeSilva,Who is the Brazilian known as Kaka?,"I find it appalling that many kids these days don't know who Ricardo Kaka is. I found this beautifully written description of his career and i wanted to share it for those who didn't watch him growing up. Thank you to the writer. For context, this was written as a rebuttal to someone who said Iniesta was better. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kaka whose prime lasted from 2005‚Äì2009, that is 2 years shorter than Iniesta, on the other hand he was also a brilliant passer, had great vision, to be called ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù by Zizou himself, had skills to beat defenders and he had that amazing pace and agility of a winger and added by his natural shooting ability of a world class forward. He played as a CAM, RW/LW, LM/RM, CF/SS. Every midfield plus forward position was suitable for him. He was a natural, unlike Iniesta everything that he did on the pitch came naturally to him. He was on the same star studded squad of Brazil with his peers being Ronaldo Fenomeno, Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Cafu and Rivaldo. He played for 4 different clubs throughout his career- Sao Paulo, AC Milan where he acquired his prime, Real Madrid and Orlando City in his last days. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Kak√° has been described on the FIFA website as having the ""capacity to glide almost effortlessly past opponents, provide defence-splitting passes and score consistently from distance.""During his prime at Milan in the mid to late 2000s, and prior to the injuries he suffered at Real Madrid which affected his mobility, Kak√° was a quick, agile, hard-working, highly skilful and creative team player with great pace, ball control, movement, and balance, capable of dribbling past defenders in one on one situations as well as during counterattacks. Ronaldinho said- ""For two, maybe three seasons \[at Milan\] he was the best player in the world. There was nothing he couldn‚Äôt do.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated football for the best part of 12 years now, winning every Ballon d'Or award since 2007 all bar one.  
&gt;  
&gt;But before them there was Kaka, who during his time at AC Milan was regarded as the best player in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;His finest year came in 2007, when he won the Champions League, Serie A Player of the Year, UEFA Club Player of the Year, FIFPro World Player of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year.  
&gt;  
&gt;It culminated in the Brazilian winning the 2007 Ballon d'Or ahead of Ronaldo - who was at Manchester United at the time - in second and Messi in third.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carl Anka of the BBC writes that his ‚Äúknee and groin problems sapped him of the explosive half-yard burst he needed to navigate the corridors of midfield uncertainty‚Äù, and that by 2009 he ‚Äúwas already on the wane.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Anka adds that being the last player to win FIFA World Player of the Year(in 2007) prior to the Messi-Ronaldo dominance over the next decade, Kak√°'s standing in the game has been ‚Äúlost in a haze‚Äù, with his ‚Äúgreatness just out of sight‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;If telling that Iniesta could never win a Ballon d‚ÄôOr due to the competition of Messi and Ronaldo, it should never be forgotten that when Kaka won it, he had to beat the likes of Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Ibrahimovic, Shevchenko, Francesco Totti, Wayne Rooney, Drogba, Del Piero, Samuel Eto‚Äôo, Lampard, Raul, and Zidane who hadn't lost their prime themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kaka was incredible during his prime. An attacking midfielder by trade, he combined creativity with the kind of raw speed and power you would expect from a striker.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was ruthless in front of goal, too, and never ceased to amaze with his 30-yard solo runs that inevitably ended up with a composed finish or an inch-perfect pass.

fobljl,SirPepeSilva,Who is the Brazilian knowns as Kaka?,"I find it appalling that many kids these days don't know who Ricardo Kaka is. I found this beautifully written description of his career and i wanted to share it for those who didn't watch him growing up. Thank you to the writer.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Kaka whose prime lasted from 2005‚Äì2009, that is 2 years shorter than Iniesta, on the other hand he was also a brilliant passer, had great vision, to be called ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù by Zizou himself, had skills to beat defenders and he had that amazing pace and agility of a winger and added by his natural shooting ability of a world class forward. He played as a CAM, RW/LW, LM/RM, CF/SS. Every midfield plus forward position was suitable for him. He was a natural, unlike Iniesta everything that he did on the pitch came naturally to him. He was on the same star studded squad of Brazil with his peers being Ronaldo Fenomeno, Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Cafu and Rivaldo. He played for 4 different clubs throughout his career- Sao Paulo, AC Milan where he acquired his prime, Real Madrid and Orlando City in his last days. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, Kak√° has been described on the FIFA website as having the ""capacity to glide almost effortlessly past opponents, provide defence-splitting passes and score consistently from distance.""During his prime at Milan in the mid to late 2000s, and prior to the injuries he suffered at Real Madrid which affected his mobility, Kak√° was a quick, agile, hard-working, highly skilful and creative team player with great pace, ball control, movement, and balance, capable of dribbling past defenders in one on one situations as well as during counterattacks. Ronaldinho said- ""For two, maybe three seasons \[at Milan\] he was the best player in the world. There was nothing he couldn‚Äôt do.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have dominated football for the best part of 12 years now, winning every Ballon d'Or award since 2007 all bar one.  
&gt;  
&gt;But before them there was Kaka, who during his time at AC Milan was regarded as the best player in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;His finest year came in 2007, when he won the Champions League, Serie A Player of the Year, UEFA Club Player of the Year, FIFPro World Player of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year.  
&gt;  
&gt;It culminated in the Brazilian winning the 2007 Ballon d'Or ahead of Ronaldo - who was at Manchester United at the time - in second and Messi in third.  
&gt;  
&gt;Carl Anka of the BBC writes that his ‚Äúknee and groin problems sapped him of the explosive half-yard burst he needed to navigate the corridors of midfield uncertainty‚Äù, and that by 2009 he ‚Äúwas already on the wane.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Anka adds that being the last player to win FIFA World Player of the Year(in 2007) prior to the Messi-Ronaldo dominance over the next decade, Kak√°'s standing in the game has been ‚Äúlost in a haze‚Äù, with his ‚Äúgreatness just out of sight‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;If telling that Iniesta could never win a Ballon d‚ÄôOr due to the competition of Messi and Ronaldo, it should never be forgotten that when Kaka won it, he had to beat the likes of Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Ibrahimovic, Shevchenko, Francesco Totti, Wayne Rooney, Drogba, Del Piero, Samuel Eto‚Äôo, Lampard, Raul, and Zidane who hadn't lost their prime themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kaka was incredible during his prime. An attacking midfielder by trade, he combined creativity with the kind of raw speed and power you would expect from a striker.  
&gt;  
&gt;He was ruthless in front of goal, too, and never ceased to amaze with his 30-yard solo runs that inevitably ended up with a composed finish or an inch-perfect pass. In addition to these characteristics, Kak√° also possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the penalty area, with either foot;he was also an accurate penalty taker.  
&gt;  
&gt;Dispossessing Kaka was impossible once he reached top speed and to this day no player has come close to replicating his style of play.  
&gt;  
&gt;A ¬£56.1m move to Real Madrid transpired in 2009 and from there it all went downhill for Kaka, who became injury prone. Playing second fiddle to Ronaldo didn't help either, but Kaka was never able to rediscover his previous form. Were it not for his injuries and troubled spell at Real, Kaka would have undoubtedly become one of the greatest players in history.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's easy to forget just how good he was during his prime, so I have shared an old video of Kaka doing what he did best at Milan called 'The Unstoppable Footballer'. Hope you understand that Iniesta is a legend for sure, but without any hatred or offence why Kaka was a better pick for any team to win matches.

fo87eg,Billion34,[OC] Cult figures of Greek football,"An expos√© on some of the most fascinating and amusing characters that graced or continue to grace Greek pitches. 

Entirely subjectively I excluded certain personalities who I felt were cashing in on a manufactured persona. This one is devoted to those who managed to steal the spotlight with their authenticity or charisma. If enough worthy candidates are mentioned in the comments there will be a part 2. 

After the positive response on the previous post I had to do some more extensive research for this one.

[**Vlassis Tsakas**](https://i.imgur.com/xDyaQdD.jpg)

I'd try and give you a description on what this man does for a living but the truth is no one actually has a fucking clue. Things that he has been involved in include a furniture business that went tits up and he ended up in prison for cutting unbacked cheques, manager at 5 star hotels at the popular tourist destination of Halkidiki and working with a solar panel company in the similarly exotic Kilkis. 

His first involvement with football came in 2001 when he approached PAOK as the representative of an Argentine investment group looking to buy the club for 12 billion drachmae or 36 million euros not adjusted for inflation. The two sides were far from an agreement as PAOK representatives were making some obscene requests such as being given a phone number to verify the interest of said group or Tsakas depositing some of the money promised. The deal fell through when center back Venetidis got sold to Olympiakos at which point the offer was withdrawn. It seems the Argentines really only cared for Venetidis and the rest of the club came in just to sweeten the deal.

It should have been obvious by then that Vlassis Tsakas had as much reliability as a Nigerian prince however eleven years later the man was back in the spotlight with a vengeance and with an Arab prince. 

It's 2012 and Panathinaikos is struggling financially. The saviour came out of a taxi in the form of the T-shirt wearing mediator of an Arab prince willing to buy the club for 220 million euros. His promises of bringing Ronaldinho, the wet dream of all big teams at the time flooded the press. That prince's name began with Sultan and ended in Al Saud but it also contained a variable that changed every time Tsakas uttered his name such as Harhan, Farfan, Afrahan, Rahman while on his excellency's passport it was Farhan. Not to mention the ""bin"" that changed place frequently. 

Unsurprisingly the deadline for the first deposit of the 220 million was missed but surprisingly the Greek press did get to see Al Saud in a press conference in Athens six months later. While he promised 70 million in the next two years after that his interest sort of fizzled away. Perhaps the attack with eggs and yogurt against Tsakas just before the press conference by Panathinaikos fans discouraged the ambitious investor whose saga officially ended in early 2013. 

Panathinaikos would eventually find an investor with a surname beginning with Al, unfortunately it was Giannis Alafouzos.

Tsakas would go on to buy the small club of Kavala, scam 80 thousand euros of a local businessman and get convicted.

[**Makis Psomiadis**](https://i.imgur.com/n4nA2T9.jpg)

A man whose life beyond football would probably make for a more interesting read. I'll just name a few of his other escapades for the sake of brevity;  torturing political prisoners dressed as a priest during the military junta, smuggling gold, owning multiple nightclubs, getting shot in the buttcheek by a fellow nightlife mobster and escaping bleeding from the hospital to evade arrest for pending warrants, accused at least twice of kidnapping and recorded torturing fellow crime associate. The majority of these were already documented by the time he got involved with AEK.

In all his public appearances [(here's a best of)](https://youtu.be/dHxLoXB94Zw) he came across as a shrewd and no nonsense businessman always brandishing his trademark cigar. His intimidating physique and his visible frustration to any challenge of his authority were probably indicative of the way he ran all his businesses. The distinctive tone of his voice, his way of speech that showed him as a man of the laity and his minimal understanding of tact solidified the mold for the satirical stereotype of the mob boss/club owner. 

""Makaros"" was involved with AEK from 1988 but it's in 2001 that he would become president of the football department. His presidency was short -only till 2003- but definitely memorable with AEK winning the Greek cup in 2002 and losing the league on the last matchday. He laid the blame on the ""watermelon farmer from Estoril"" ;  Fernando Santos.

One of the highlights of his tenure was the transfer of proud Olympiakos fan Georgatos from Inter with Psomiadis marking this *a day for celebration* while dozens of ultras outside were protesting by turning Georgatos' car into a convertible. Coincidentally a few days later one of those ultras would see his own business severely damaged.

Psomiadis would probably have had a longer presidency had he not have opened a conflict with team legend Demis Nikolaidis. 

The moustache wearing businessman had been doing late night social calls along with a group of neckless bodyguards to players to ensure they were not out clubbing. When he decided to pay a visit to Demis, Nikolaidis misunderstood the president's concern as an intrusion on his privacy and told him to get lost. Psomiadis grabbed him by the neck and threatened him, Nikolaidis pressed charges and shortly left for Atletico Madrid. 

The incident marked the beginning of the end for Makis who fell out of favour with the entirety of the AEK fanbase and passed the presidency for a transitional period onto his cousins; Charilaos Psomiadis and... Charilaos Psomiadis. (In order to tell them apart they were given the nicknames Charilaos ""past five"" and Charilaos ""five to"".)

It was later found out Makaros had embezzled about 20 million euros from AEK and died owing the club 80 million with interest. He had owned the club of Kavala which in 2010 he promoted to the Superleague getting them a handsome 6th place. The club would get relegated after the ensuing match fixing scandal the following year with Psomiadis convicted. 

The rest years of his life were spent half in prison and half in North Macedonia evading arrest until he died in 2016. Upon his death AEK offered its sincere condolences.

[**Giorgos Minos**](https://i.imgur.com/2rTXyO1.jpg)

Like a lot of other state television employees he wouldn't be working in any other country's broadcasting corporation. However he is a product of different times and the small society of Thessaloniki. And thus Giorgos Minos has been a reporter for 39 years. For as long as I can remember Minos has been covering the news for PAOK in the longest running sport show in Greece, his raspy voice and incoherent speech becoming staple of our Sunday nights.

What comes across quite subtly as he covers the news for PAOK is that he may actually support this team. Some such subtle indications include [the amount of times he mentions the name PAOK in his every reportage](https://youtu.be/adEJtXMAl-s).

During the past years with PAOK's increasing success he has really come into his own. In the 2017-18 season [Apollon's Giannis Kontoes (former AEK) who was a guest on the show dared to say he thought AEK had a better team. Minos visibly distraught tried to ask what was supposed to be a question but turned out to be nonsensical  fast paced jarble containing some stats about PAOK's results in an attempt to change the doubter's mind. The answer of a laughing/pleading Kontoes; Please Mr Minos, I'm sorry, I'm just a footballer, I just said my opinion. ](https://youtu.be/ZHhgdqsPjOs)

[It was the same season that he tried to take a jab at AEK's Galanopoulos by telling him to ask a former PAOK player and teammate how it's like to play in Toumba. What he forgot was that Galanopoulos had indeed played in Toumba the season before that and won 1-0 and the footballer in fact reminded that to a dumbfounded Minos. ](https://youtu.be/hNcpX0QFSD0)

And if that season's title was lost, Giorgos Minos would be rewarded for his lifetime loyalty to covering PAOK with the 2018-19 title. 

Great moments from that season include [him wearing PAOK'S coach Razvan Lucescu's trademark cap on live coverage](https://i.imgur.com/tHG59eK.jpg)  ,  [getting two musicians to perform Ivan Savvidis' favourite traditional song for the PAOK owner's 60th birthday](https://youtu.be/WRtcHMwu620?t=47)         

[and the bus parade after the award ceremony during which he would have his name chanted by PAOK fans while also managing to mix up Superman and Batman referring to a shirt with the trademark giant S that our goalie was wearing.](https://youtu.be/APw3rUHwBgg)

I do apologize for the great deal of clips of him that I left out, however the one that is a guilty pleasure of mine is [this potato quality one pronouncing in its entirety the name of another less remembered cult icon.](https://youtu.be/2cP7fT3KR-g) 

[**Ognen Vranjes**](https://i.imgur.com/Xcav4Oo.jpg)

This one may come with a hint of recency bias. Vranjes came to Greece as a center back for AEK in 2017, having already built a reputation for controversy, and immediately became a fan favourite. Maybe it's due to his passionate defending. Maybe it's due to his hot temper that makes a bet on him getting the most cards in a season, one of the few safe investments in Greece. Or maybe it's due to his numerous trashy Instagram posts either [attacking Olympiakos](https://i.imgur.com/NFaj6WQ.jpg)  ,  [praising AEK ultras](https://i.imgur.com/2TYiAL4.png) or [both at the same time](https://i.imgur.com/acuuiaO.jpg)

In any case his 2017-18 stint in Greece was so memorable that both sides never really got over their one year break and the Bosnian returned. In large part that was due to his behaviour outside the pitch, his constant misdemeanors in the dressing room and the aforementioned Instagram posts including one with similarly hot-headed Croat teammate Marko Livaja singing chants against Olympiakos. All these would suffice to build a turbulent relationship with his club(s) and a love affair with the AEK fans. 

The reason he makes it on this list however is for a different love affair. The one he had with the married Bosnian singer Jelena Karleusa. The two were involved in a dramatic Instagram feud with Karleusa posting their interactions strife with mutual emotional abuse, in response to him jeopardising her wedding by publicizing their relationship. More importantly she also shared [this](https://i.imgur.com/7VbOdtR.jpg) legendary picture of him crying. He in return posted her nudes, pleas from her to rebuke his statements and proof of their affair with a video of them visiting the Acropolis. Fair to say the Greek public opinion was thoroughly entertained and Olympiakos fans couldn't drop the chance to poke fun at the Bosnian in this season's derby with [this](https://i.imgur.com/EyByMnf.jpg) banner. Vranjes once again to the club's dissatisfaction replied in his usual mature and thoughtful way ; [you can only wank over this bitch, only aekara. ](https://i.imgur.com/05QzNNY.jpg)

[**Savvas Theodoridis**](https://i.imgur.com/mFDerrI.jpg)

85 yr old former Olympiakos keeper and father of UEFA executive Theodoros Theodoridis was a footnote in Greek football history until the 2010s. Few remember his playing days in the fifties and his presence as something of a team staff member at the club afterwards was not that memorable. 

He first started making ripples with his statements from 2013 onwards;

&gt;""Olympiakos has always answered on the pitch and never used TV to slander other clubs.""

&gt;""These are human mistakes. Stop with all this fairytales about referees, it dishonours the great club of Panathinaikos.""

&gt;""All they want is to slander Olympiakos and intimidate the referees.""

No one really mulled over these statements too much but the public opinion formed for Mr Theodoridis was that of a senile old man that people shouldn't pay that much attention to. And thus he was given the fond nickname of ""Kyr Savvas"" or ""Mr Savvas"" as you would call the elderly shop owner of your neighborhood.

For a bit of historical background, from 1996 to 2016 Olympiakos won every single championship apart from two. The majority at least a month before the season ended. 

2017-18 and 2018-19 are the only two seasons that Olympiakos had a significant title challenger in this decade. In both occasions they lost the title to AEK and PAOK, coming third and second. I won't comment on the integrity of refereeing prior or after the 2016 intervention of UEFA in Greek affairs as most people already have an opinion. Instead here are some handpicked quotes (in contrast with those he previously made) from Mr Savvas during the past three seasons that gave him his cult icon status;

&gt;""I found out this German referee is from the 3rd division. Mr Pereira (UEFA refereeing supervisor) is certainly involved with this and is bringing us every 'faulty device' from Europe.  Because of Pereira we've lost two Greek championships. He should leave Greece immediately. Him and the other guy -whatdyoucallhim-  Fusek (UEFA supervisor of Greek football). They should hit the road and leave.""

&gt;""I want to thank our fans for putting up with this referee, appointed by Mr 'Fereira' and all these dogs inside the federation. I will not stop from now on with lawsuits. [...] They should leave me alone because I have a glorious history with huge certificates behind me... huge.... And if I show them the world will.. (incomprehensible). No one is worthy to get such papers of decency and admiration and congratulations. In my life I've won 45 trophies, how can little PAOK compare, it's laughable. [...] I'm talking as Savvas Theodoridis, the servant and soldier of Olympiakos.""

&gt;""I cannot talk to ERT (public broadcasting corporation). I'm not talking to you as Olympiakos but as Savvas Theodoridis, 70 years honorary president of Olympiakos with 45 trophies. We have great complaints from ERT, not just me but the 5 million fans of Olympiakos (author's note ; Greece's population is 10 million) who haven't heard a nice word for the president of Olympiakos, Mr Marinakis in four years. We cannot accept this. I'm struggling to keep these 5 million calm.""

Unfortunately a lot of his stuff does get lost in translation such as the racially undertoned comparison of his team's reception at AEK with things happening in his invented African country home to the ""Bazibuzuks"". 

Despite his age he still follows the team everywhere and likes to give his two cents after every game in front of the cameras and I for one I'm glad.

[**Aggelos Anastasiadis**](https://i.imgur.com/zB28QkE.jpg)

As a player he can boast two championships and three cups however he is neither a man to boast nor is his playing career what he's known for.

Anastasiadis has been a coach since 1994. His resume includes historic teams such as Panathinaikos, PAOK (three times), Iraklis (two times) and Larissa as well as many other smaller clubs, a successful tenure with the Cyprus NT and a very recent not so successful tenure with the Greek NT. 

He lead PAOK to an unlikely cup win in 2003 and the CL qualifiers of 2005, Iraklis twice got to play European football with him, his time in Panathinaikos was not bad, he's never been relegated and he took Cyprus out of the bottom feeders with some big wins. 

With that said, the reason he makes this list is for his quotes and habits. While he has a great way of reading the game and making incisive subs he always came across as someone who doesn't quite understand football tactics. 

One of the many such examples after he won the 2003 cup final when he was quoted; 
&gt;Don't ask me about tactics lads after a cup final, that's for you to talk about. 

Indeed it's fair to say by those who have followed his career he doesn't seem to really worry about these details. 

It's that attitude that Sokratis didn't appreciate when Anastasiadis was NT coach and after a loss to Armenia, said either me or him prompting the manager's sack after four qualifier games. 

Apart from football tactics he seems to not fully grasp foreign players, (having famously come to a disagreement with Souza at Panathinaikos) or their names for that matter. Eyal (Golasa) turned into the easier Giannis as well as Facundo (Pereyra) who switched to the more convenient Fanouris. 

More to the point the easiest excuse he gives for ridicule is his love for the Holy Mother. He frequently mentions Her as the driving force behind his teams' success in previous or upcoming matches. As he said on his last time with PAOK; 
&gt;From now on I leave the team on the hands of the Queen. Now some will say ; is he going to be sitting? [as in not working] I don't know who would say such a thing and why.

One particular display of his affection towards the Theotokos during [this clip before the start of a match.](https://youtu.be/8MnYZvahIZ8?t=33)

He has stated in an interview that he doesn't accept a job unless he asks his priest and has rejected a manager position at AEK when he received a negative response. Anecdotal stories exist of him taking the team to church on Sunday and players to Mt. Athos so it's perhaps fitting that his longest interview was given to a small ecclesiastical TV station which I watched in its entirety for the sake of research... I think...

I feel though that part of him has been persecuted with a vengeance by the media and far be it from me to mock a man's faith. Besides he is probably the only innocuous man on this list.

fo37gg,GigioDonnarumma99,"Paolo Maldini for Corriere della Sera: 'I am feeling well, the worst has passed already. I still have a bit of a dry cough, I've lost my taste and smell. Football should have been stopped earlier, it was madness to play league games and Champions League games with the pandemic going on'","*""I'm pretty good. The worst moments are gone.""* Paolo Maldini gave an interview to Corriere della Sera, during which he spoke about his state of health after contracting the Coronavirus: *""I still have a bit of a dry cough - he said - I've lost my taste and smell, hopefully I'll come back. It was like a slightly uglier flu. But it's not a normal flu. I know my body. An athlete knows himself. The pains are particularly strong. And then it feels like a squeeze in your chest... It's a new virus. The body fights against an enemy it doesn't know.""*

*""I felt the first symptoms on Thursday, March 5,""* added the head of the Milan technical area, *""pain in the joints and muscles. I never more than 38.5 degrees fever. The next day, Friday, I was supposed to go to Milanello, and I stayed home. I also missed Milan-Genoa. I only treated myself with tachipirin. I didn't take antivirals because I never had breathing difficulties"".*

Fortunately, Maldini had no contact with the team during the days he took the virus: *""I hadn't seen the players for 14 days. None of them are positive. We at AC Milan are very health-conscious, we have a lot of resources, we have an agreement with San Raffaele. But we've chosen to stick scrupulously to the rules set by our city, by our region"".*

Obviously, Maldini underwent the swab, which gave a positive result: *""The Asl doctors came, wearing gloves and masks. No, no diving suit. It was last Tuesday. After two days the verdict came: positive. I already knew I had the virus. I felt that it wasn't a flu like the others; and then for the flu I had had the vaccine. Sure, you're worried about it. A friend of mine had respiratory problems, he's in the hospital in Legnano, he doesn't sleep, he has nightmares... I had better luck. Anyway, I've been confined here for 18 days with my family.""*

His son Daniel has also been infected: ""Daniel also has pains and fever. *""But he's so young... I think he's the one in the family who's taken it lightly. My wife and Christian have swabbed and they're negative. But we think they got the virus, too, and they're already out of it.""*

*****

In the course of the interview, Maldini went beyond his situation, also talking about football, again in relation to the Covid-19 emergency: *""Football should have stopped earlier. Already playing behind closed doors is violence, for the fans and the footballers. Playing behind closed doors Liverpool-Atletico, with 4,000 Spanish fans in the stands, when it was already known that Madrid was a hotbed, was madness. When Atalanta-Valencia was played the alarm hadn't gone off yet, but now we know that that night is one of the causes of the Bergamo outbreak"".*

At the moment there's no certain date for the restart of Serie A: *""There has to be a ending to the Serie A season there will be. But when we can't say it now. I understand that for people it would be a precious way of entertainment. But in football it's impossible not only to play, but also to train without contact. And then it's right to put all teams on the same level. Some, like Sampdoria, are more affected. Some of Juve's most representative players are positive. We mustn't be in a hurry. You can't recover from this virus in two days. All the players must have time to recover and train. It will take at least two weeks of preparation before they return to play"".*

The Coronavirus has particularly affected the city of Milan, but Maldini has no doubt: *""Milan will fly again, Starting all over again is in its nature. But after the emergency will be gone, the city will have a very hard time. The economy, small businesses will be semi-destroyed. Politics must do much more. It must reassure people. I don't like Trump, but he has understood that the Americans need to be reassured by guaranteeing a good part of their salary. It's one thing to stay locked in your house knowing that you will have something to live on, but to stay locked in your house without certainties creates unbearable anguish. The state, the government must understand this. And give a sign that it understands, as soon as possible""*.

fo1g14,steaminbeamen,[OC] I Made a Premier League Cryptic Quiz For You to Enjoy!,"# The 2020 Premier League Cryptic Quiz

Bored in isolation, I've put together a cryptic quiz entirely Premier League related. Hopefully someone can get some enjoyment from it like I enjoyed making it. At least it might give you something to do if you're stuck at home. 

**HOW DOES IT WORK**

If you're familar with cryptic crosswords, you can solve these questions very similarly. There will always be a definition (or at least a logical hint that narrows the options down) in each question and a cryptic way to solve it. So keep an eye out for anagrams, hidden answers, phonetics, double meanings etc. All the answers are **current premier league players**. There are 20 questions and **one answer/player for each team currently in the league.** 

Here's an example question to explain it a bit better:

*Merlin transformed ageless midfielder into fullback (6)*

The answer is Milner. As he is an ageless midfielder who has played fullback (definition). 'Transformed' is a trigger word which means a word or words before or after it are jumbled or ""transformed"". The word 'Merlin' is an anagram for Milner.

**THE QUIZ**

1. Everybody sounded keen to eat Italian (4)

2. An EPL winner annoyed with offside calls believes VAR dying partly solves the problem (5)

3. Curry complement was eaten by a hammer midfielder (4)

4. Magpie mysteriously maintains mix of magic (12)

5. Defective darling scored an FA Cup final winning goal (7)

6. Big money signing had to take Physical Education twice (4)

7. Loanee was told to hydrate (10)

8. Seagull shooter was vocal about getting more pay (7)

9. The blades definitely aren't blunt when in the hands of English striker (5)

10. Goal-scorer devastated a rogue defender (6)

11. A resume was handed in at law firm in Oxfordshire by a Brazilian (7)

12. Saint was an odd and bad mess (5)

13. Defender is known to somehow ski at work (9)

14. Underrated Frenchman was spotted driving a coupe wildly (6)

15. Initially the first league leader overtly received in swap was a shot stopper (6)

16. Young canary conceals his incredible wisdom (5)

17. A young goose in Bournemouth could be the brother of Ryan (7)

18. The ball was taken aggressively by World Cup winner (5)

19. German mister was outside, eye for goal he had (5)

20. Midfielder who usually wears number 8 put on the number 7 jersey backwards (5)

&amp;#x200B;

*If you would prefer the quiz in crossword format you can access it here:* [*https://www.armoredpenguin.com/crossword/Data/2020.03/2400/24002617.754.html*](https://www.armoredpenguin.com/crossword/Data/2020.03/2400/24002617.754.html)*. The website is a bit clunky but you can solve it online and it might be helpful in solving a couple of the harder ones.* 

I hope to get some answers in the comments, first person to answer them all correctly wins my love and affection. If anyone is interested I can post the answers with explanations later on.

fnzk1l,displacedindavis,The Adidas vs Nike kit manufacturer battle across different top leagues around the world,"These two giants have been at it for years and it's no surprise that one of the biggest stages has been the world of football. I'm in no way endorsing any company in this post, this is just a simple look at the clients of these two companies around the world **as of today (so please don't be like ""you forgot to include Liverpool under Nike"")**.

This post will be primarily UEFA-based but I will include leagues from other confederations as well.

Along those lines, I realize that there are other major kit manufacturing giants such as Puma. Unfortunately, I won't have the space to list every single club with a non-Adidas and non-Nike kit supplier out there. So sadly, some teams such as Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, Porto, and Celtic will be missing (they use New Balance, Puma, Puma, New Balance, and New Balance respectively).

Please try not to read too much into this other than a simple list. Without further ado, here we go:

**A-League**:

* Adidas: Melbourne Victory
* Nike: Western Sydney Wanderers

**Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1**:

* Adidas: ASO Chief, CR Belouizdad, JS Kabylie
* Nike: N/A

**A Lyga**:

* Adidas: N/A

One thing I noticed very quickly is that Adidas tended to have a more elite profile among football clubs. Adidas is affiliated with the most successful team in the respective nation by league titles won (all eras combined) in:

* Algeria
* Argentina
* Australia
* Austria
* Belarus
* Bulgaria
* Canada
* Croatia
* Denmark
* England
* Germany
* Gibraltar
* Greece
* Italy
* Kazakhstan
* Malta
* Netherlands
* Norway
* Poland
* Portugal
* Slovakia
* Slovenia
* Spain
* Turkey
* United States
* Uzbekistan

Nike can claim this distinction in:

* Azerbaijan (and if Qarabaƒü keeps on winning, Azerbaijan may join the Adidas list soon)
* Czech Republic
* Hungary
* Iceland
* Japan
* Lithuania
* Mexico
* Romania
* Russia

I hesitate to give a solid reason why this is the case. I'll leave this up to you guys to discuss.",7,1585027126,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fnzk1l/the_adidas_vs_nike_kit_manufacturer_battle_across/,soccer,1

fnr18g,blueballs360,(Discussion) Who is the worse ever player that has put on the shirt for your club or national team," 

Since we are locked out of football due to covid 19 lets have this discussion to pass the time. This can count for any player, bought, youth player, they can even play for one minute in a cup game. I am fascinated in how this shit player has put on the shirt for the club, maybe a cereal box competition. What was there contribution to the club, in a negative way.

For Man Utd, he could pick Bebe, Mark Lynch or Taibi but at least Bebe has forged himself a decent career in the Spanish second division. For this I have to say Dong Fangzhuo who was a real ""marketing signing"" to promote themselves in the Chinese market who had a few appearances but looked way out of his depth, couldn't even make the Chinese National Team, journeyman in shitty lower league in China and Armenia and judging from Wikipedia, he is 33 and hasn't played since 2014.

For Ireland, it has to be Joe Lapira, who played one friendly in 2007, played in the American amateur leagues, failed trials in Scotland with Rangers and Aberdeen, had a few spells in lower leagues in Norway played in a friendly in the US v Equador in 2007 under Steve Staunton(possibly on drugs) and even players in the Ireland team at the time like Kevin Kilbane said he was way out of his depth.

fnprgz,iisminus1,The Stats That You Still Can't Believe Are Real,"So let's go,


1. Lionel Messi scored **91 goals** in a single calendar year.

This stat is famous tho but still unbelievable.

2. Didier Drogba's **big game record** was insane - aka Finals record.

The Ivorian played in 11 cup finals for Chelsea, scoring in ten of them and only losing once.

He also absolutely loved terrorising Arsenal, scoring 15 goals in as many games against the Gunners. Only Spurs Harry Kane being close to him against arsenal I guess.


3. Roy Hodgson is older than the **Santiago Bernabeu**


72 years of age, he was born before Real Madrid's iconic stadium was built.


**127 days older**


4. Jose Mourinho went **nine** years without losing a home game

This is crazy, Legend has some great records.

Jose Mourino didn't lose a single home game between March 2002 and April 2011. He managed four different clubs during that period

That's **9(!) years and 150 games.**



5. Manchester United have **NEVER** lost a Premier League game at Old Trafford after leading at half-time.

If Manchester United are winning at half-time at home in the Premier League, there's next to no chance of them losing.


6. Chelsea conceded just **15 goals** in the 2004/05 Premier League season


7. Messi and Ronaldo and their sons have the exact **same age gap**

Born 869 days apart, the two titans of world football have shared the stage for over ten years. Will their sons do the same? Rather eerily, there's also the same age gap between Cristiano Jr and Thiago, Messi's eldest son.

8. Manchester United have named an academy graduate in their squad for over **4,000** games in a row.

Manchester United pride themselves on giving young players a chance in the first-team and the stats absolutely back that up. Since 1937, they've named an academy graduate in the matchday squad for over 4,000 consecutive games.



9. PSG players have the **most bizarre bonus**

Applauding the supporters after a game is pretty mandatory across football, even after a poor result.

But for PSG players, they are given an 'ethical bonus' if they do so. Neymar, the most expensive player in world football, is said to receive 375,000 euros just for a bit of post-match clapping.

fnp0pw,FootballBallsack,All time non-NZ Oceanian XI,"Ahoy Redditors!

So, with the current lack of football worldwide, I've decided to make an all-time non-NZ OFC Classic XI. I've decided to enforce a few rules, as otherwise I could select players such as [Pascal Vahirua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Vahirua), [Adrian Mariappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mariappa), [Tim Cahill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cahill), [Fr√©d√©ric Piquionne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr√©d√©ric_Piquionne), [Jacques Zimako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Zimako) and of course [Christian Karembeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Karembeu).

So, my two (loose) rules are... Players who are eligible to play for the countries listed, without being cap-tied to other countries (or having had played for the country in question) and (where possible) players who have retired internationally, or have at least ended their professional careers.

Let me know if I've missed anyone!

-|-|[Patrick Jacquemet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Jacquemet)|-|-

Once again, I've gone for a pretty standard 4-3-3/4-1-2-3 formation. Perhaps I'm rather biased, but I believe this formation is the best all-round setup, as well as allowing me to select a few more attackers (which there are a lot more of).

[GK - Patrick Jacquemet - Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Jacquemet): Jacquemet spent almost a decade in Division 2 and 3 in France. After his professional career came to an end, he was asked to play for a single season in Tahiti, but ended out emigrating there. In the twilight of his career, he was called up for the 1998 OFC Nations Cup, where the Polynesians finished a respectable 4th place. After a brief managerial career, he took up an advisory role with the Oceanian Football Federation and works with budding goalkeepers in the Pacific region.

[LB - Robert Wayaridri - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wayaridri): Be prepared to see a lot of New Caledonians on this list! This selection was quite hard, as there's not a great deal of geniunely talented Oceanian players from yesteryear, but here goes. Not much information is available about Wayaridri's early career, but after playing youth football in New Caledonia, he moved to Gaz√©lec Ajaccio in 1997. He played over 100 matches for the Corsican outfit, before moving to semi professional outfit ES Fr√©jus. He retired at age 32, but was convinced to come out of retirement and play for JS Baco back in New Caledonia. He has since taken up a role as assistant coach to the New Caledonian national side, where his son has been capped.

[CB - Antoine Kombouar√© - New Caledonia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Kombouar√©): Kombouar√© is one of the easiest choices to make for the two centre-backs. He played 177 Division 1 matches for Nantes, as well as playing frequently in the UEFA Cup. After 7 years with the Les Canaris, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain, where he would become known as the ""Golden Helmet"", due to his stoppage time winning headers. Perhaps his finest career moment came in the 92/93 UEFA Cup quarter-final, when he scored a 90+6th minute goal against Real Madrid, knocking out the Spaniards. His later career saw him play in Switzerland and Scotland, before a managerial career, where he would take charge of Paris Saint-Germain.

[CB - John Gope-Fenepej - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gope-Fenepej): A bit of a questionable choice here, but due to the lack of true Oceanian defenders playing professionally, Gope-Fenepej gets selected as a substitute. After moving to France as a youth in order to become a professional footballer, Gope-Fenepej was taken in by Nantes, who he made his professional debut for at 20. He was briefly signed on loan by Sam Allardyce's Bolton Wanderers. Two appearances in the Championship followed, before another loan deal to Ligue 2 side Cr√©teil. His career quickly declined and he played out his days playing lower-tier football in France, before moving back to New Caledonia to become a coach with AS Tiga Sport.

[RB - Mo√Øse Gorendiaw√© - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo√Øse_Gorendiaw√©): Again, quite an easy selection at right-back. Gorendiaw√© played his career playing for Gaz√©lec Ajaccio and AC Ajaccio. Unfortunately, his record is hard to come by, however it is known that he played over 250 appearances, more than 50 of which were in Division 1. He passed away in either 2000 or 2001. Any more information would be greatly appreciated!

[LM - Marama Vahirua - Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marama_Vahirua): Perhaps the easiest choice of this whole list. Vahirua was an unexpected supersub for Nantes' surprise 2000-01 Ligue 1 championship winning team. Spells for Nice, Lorient, Nancy and Monaco followed, seeing him collect over 300 Ligue 1 appearances. He spent his later professional career on loan with Panthrakikos, before moving back to his native Tahiti. Vahirua made himself unavailable for selection with Tahiti, however with Tahiti's qualification to the 2013 Confederations Cup, he deemed it was ""the closest thing I'll ever get to playing in a World Cup"". Vahirua's corner set up Tahiti's only goal of the tournament, after which he announced his international retirement. He was enticed out of retirement for two more matches in 2018, however his time as a genuinely world-class player has passed.

[DM - Wesley Lautoa - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Lautoa): So, my first real current player. Lautoa has been a mainstay in the defence of clubs in France for the last 15 years. A no-nonsense defender, his physical stature and surprising agility allow him to be utilised as the starting point for an attack. With just shy of 200 Ligue 1 matches under his belt and the lack of depth in Oceanian defences, he is an easy choice in this category. Internationally, he is eligable for New Caledonia, due to his heritage, yet thus far he has rejected frequent call ups by the Melanesians.

[RM - Esala Masi - Fiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esala_Masi): Masi's career started in Fiji, before quickly being snapped up to play in Australia's National Soccer League. He played over 200 matches in the top flight competition, scoring at better than a goal every 5 matches. After the fall of the NSL, Masi took up playing in the state leagues of Australia, before moving back to Fiji for two seasons. He ended his career as a journeyman, playing in various clubs in the state leagues. His international record saw him score 32 goals from 52 appearances, including 7 against Kiribati, 5 against Tonga and 4 against American Samoa. In 2008, he was selected to play in the OFC All-Star XI. After his retirement in 2013, he has taken up coaching.

[LW - Reggie Davani - Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Davani): Davani's story is a little ""what if?""... Due to the unique nature of Oceanian football, playing professional football in Oceania in the 1990s, the best way to make a living as a professional footballer was to play in the summer in one league and another league in winter. With this back and forth career, Davani scored more than 200 goals... Impressive, considering he played for well over a dozen teams and had to acclimbatise. His blistering speed, ball control and technical skill made him able to play any position in attack or midfield. Still to this day, he hold's Papua New Guinea's goalscoring record, having scored a goal every 1.5 games for the Kapuls.

[CF - Marc-Kanyan Case - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Kanyan_Case): Case's senior career started at 17, playing for Olympique Noum√©a. At 19, he (like many of his colleagues) moved to Corsica, chasing a career as a professional footballer. Case was selected by the New Caledonian national team to play at the 1963 South Pacific Games, where he scored a brace in the semi-final against Tahiti and followed that up by scoring 4 against Fiji in the final. After moving to France, his career stagnated, as he struggled to get gametime with Gaz√©lec Ajaccio. In 1968, he was selected to play for France in the Mexico City Olympics, where they were eliminated in the quarter-finals. A year later, he moved to Bastia, where he would gain recognition as one of the greatest strikers in the league. By the end of his career, he'd scored over 100 goals in under 300 games in France's top two divisions and is considered a legend in New Caledonian football.

[RW - Roy Krishna - Fiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Krishna): At the age of 32, Krishna already holds the goal scoring record at two clubs, in two different leagues. He scored 55 goals in 75 appearances for Waitakere United in the New Zealand Football Championship, before a brief move to continental giants Auckland City. He scored Auckland City's only goal of the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup. He was quickly signed as a temporary player for Wellington Phoenix in the Australian A-League, however after a man-of-the-match performance and goal on debut, he was quickly signed permanently. His extreme pace and versatility saw him win the A-League Golden Boot for the 18/19 season. After scoring over 50 goals, he moved to ATK in the Indian Super League, where he tied for the league's top scorer award. Watching him play, it's easy to see why clubs such as PSV Eindhoven have been interested in signing the Fijian.

Substitutes

[GK - Seiloni Iaruel - Vanuatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiloni_Iaruel): Iaruel started his career at 16 and, by 17 had been invited along to a one month long trial with Stoke City. The 6ft 5in shotstopper gets the nod for the reserve goalkeeper for his fearless goalkeeping and his extreme aggression, often putting his body on the line.

[DF - Nicolas Vallar - Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Vallar): Signed by Angers at the age of 13, Vallar quickly rose up the ranks of the youth system, including being selected for the Tahitian Under 20 national team. He moved to Montpellier, before moving to FC S√®te. After playing in Ligue 2, he moved on to Penafiel in Portugal's second division. Internationally, he captained the Tahitian team at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and still plays in Tahiti's First Division today.

[MF - Henry Fa'arodo - Vanuatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fa'arodo): For nearly two decades, Fa'arodo was the danger man for the Solomon Islands' national team. Another technically brilliant player, Fa'arodo's career took him to both the Australian A-League and the 2004 OFC Nations Cup final. He was instrumental in the Solomon's two-all draw against the Socceroos in Adelaide.

[MF - Micah Lea'alafa - Solomon Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Lea'alafa): The technically gifted Lea'alafa started his career in the Solomon Islands, before moving to Vanuatu. He was scouted and signed by Auckland City in the New Zealand Football Championship, where he made himself a mainstay in their midfield. Since then, Lea'alafa became the first Oceanian player to play professional football in Africa, having signed for Maritzburg United in 2019.

[FW - David Browne - Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Browne_(footballer\)): How many 16 year olds are able to claim to have played in the FIFA Club World Cup? Browne's career has gone from strength to strength. After developing at Port Moresby School of Excellence's academy, he signed for Auckland City after a brief stint with Central United. After three turbulent seasons, he was first signed by PEC Zwolle, then by FC Groningen. He's now recently signed with HJK Helsinki and, at age 24, seems to have a bright future.

Well, that's it! Cheers for reading this complete crap! Once again, let me know who I've missed!

fnovl3,FootballBallsack,All-time non-NZ OFC XI,"Ahoy!

Reposting my work from the other day!

So, with the current lack of football worldwide, I've decided to make an all-time non-NZ OFC Classic XI. I've decided to enforce a few rules, as otherwise I could select players such as [Pascal Vahirua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Vahirua), [Adrian Mariappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mariappa), [Tim Cahill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cahill), [Fr√©d√©ric Piquionne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr√©d√©ric_Piquionne), [Jacques Zimako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Zimako) and of course [Christian Karembeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Karembeu).

So, my two (loose) rules are... Players who are eligible to play for the countries listed, without being cap-tied to other countries (or having had played for the country in question) and (where possible) players who have retired internationally, or have at least ended their professional careers.

Let me know if I've missed anyone!

Once again, I've gone for a pretty standard 4-3-3/4-1-2-3 formation. Perhaps I'm rather biased, but I believe this formation is the best all-round setup, as well as allowing me to select a few more attackers (which there are a lot more of).

[GK - Patrick Jacquemet - Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Jacquemet): Jacquemet spent almost a decade in Division 2 and 3 in France. After his professional career came to an end, he was asked to play for a single season in Tahiti, but ended out emigrating there. In the twilight of his career, he was called up for the 1998 OFC Nations Cup, where the Polynesians finished a respectable 4th place. After a brief managerial career, he took up an advisory role with the Oceanian Football Federation and works with budding goalkeepers in the Pacific region.

[LB - Robert Wayaridri - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wayaridri): Be prepared to see a lot of New Caledonians on this list! This selection was quite hard, as there's not a great deal of geniunely talented Oceanian players from yesteryear, but here goes. Not much information is available about Wayaridri's early career, but after playing youth football in New Caledonia, he moved to Gaz√©lec Ajaccio in 1997. He played over 100 matches for the Corsican outfit, before moving to semi professional outfit ES Fr√©jus. He retired at age 32, but was convinced to come out of retirement and play for JS Baco back in New Caledonia. He has since taken up a role as assistant coach to the New Caledonian national side, where his son has been capped.

[CB - Antoine Kombouar√© - New Caledonia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Kombouar√©): Kombouar√© is one of the easiest choices to make for the two centre-backs. He played 177 Division 1 matches for Nantes, as well as playing frequently in the UEFA Cup. After 7 years with the Les Canaris, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain, where he would become known as the ""Golden Helmet"", due to his stoppage time winning headers. Perhaps his finest career moment came in the 92/93 UEFA Cup quarter-final, when he scored a 90+6th minute goal against Real Madrid, knocking out the Spaniards. His later career saw him play in Switzerland and Scotland, before a managerial career, where he would take charge of Paris Saint-Germain.

[CB - John Gope-Fenepej - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gope-Fenepej): A bit of a questionable choice here, but due to the lack of true Oceanian defenders playing professionally, Gope-Fenepej gets selected as a substitute. After moving to France as a youth in order to become a professional footballer, Gope-Fenepej was taken in by Nantes, who he made his professional debut for at 20. He was briefly signed on loan by Sam Allardyce's Bolton Wanderers. Two appearances in the Championship followed, before another loan deal to Ligue 2 side Cr√©teil. His career quickly declined and he played out his days playing lower-tier football in France, before moving back to New Caledonia to become a coach with AS Tiga Sport.

[RB - Mo√Øse Gorendiaw√© - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo√Øse_Gorendiaw√©): Again, quite an easy selection at right-back. Gorendiaw√© played his career playing for Gaz√©lec Ajaccio and AC Ajaccio. Unfortunately, his record is hard to come by, however it is known that he played over 250 appearances, more than 50 of which were in Division 1. He passed away in either 2000 or 2001. Any more information would be greatly appreciated!

[LM - Marama Vahirua - Tahiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marama_Vahirua): Perhaps the easiest choice of this whole list. Vahirua was an unexpected supersub for Nantes' surprise 2000-01 Ligue 1 championship winning team. Spells for Nice, Lorient, Nancy and Monaco followed, seeing him collect over 300 Ligue 1 appearances. He spent his later professional career on loan with Panthrakikos, before moving back to his native Tahiti. Vahirua made himself unavailable for selection with Tahiti, however with Tahiti's qualification to the 2013 Confederations Cup, he deemed it was ""the closest thing I'll ever get to playing in a World Cup"". Vahirua's corner set up Tahiti's only goal of the tournament, after which he announced his international retirement. He was enticed out of retirement for two more matches in 2018, however his time as a genuinely world-class player has passed.

[DM - Wesley Lautoa - New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Lautoa): So, my first real current player. Lautoa has been a mainstay in the defence of clubs in France for the last 15 years.

fnof79,SS2602,Throwback to some of the craziest Mario Balotelli moments.,"Some of the craziest moments Mario Balotelli -

&amp;nbsp;



 ‚Ä¢ In June 2010, Balotelli and a group of friends fired air pistols in the open in Milan's Piazza della Repubblica.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢Balotelli was once carrying ¬£5,000 in his back-pocket, and when a police officer asked why he had such a large sum of cash, Balotelli replied, ""Because I am rich.""

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢Mario Balotelli was bored and he decided that throwing darts at a youth player was not only safe but a civil thing to do. 

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢Mario and his younger brother Enock drove into a women‚Äôs prison in Italy to ""have a look around"".


&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Balotelli and friends set Balotelli's house on fire when a firework was let off in it; later that week, Balotelli was unveiled as Greater Manchester's ambassador for firework safety.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ In December 2011, Balotelli broke a 48-hour curfew before Manchester City's match against Chelsea to go to a curry house, although he ""was not drinking alcohol, he signed autographs, posed for pictures with fellow diners and was involved in a mock sword-fight using rolling pins"".

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ On 1 December 2014, Balotelli was accused of racism and antisemitism for posting an image on Instagram of the video game character Mario. The image promoted anti-racism by telling others to be like the character, attributing him qualities stereotypically associated with different ethnicities, ending the idea that he ""jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew"". In response to criticisms, he wrote, ""My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please.""

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢He proclaimed that he would 'kill' any racists at Euro 2012. ""If someone throws a banana at me in the street, I will go to jail, because I will kill them.""

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ He randomly showed up to a press conference in Italy where a new coach was being introducing at an unrelated team, then left.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢He was fined $400,000 for going to a strip club two nights before a game.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢He stopped at a local high school, used the bathroom and left. He also meandered around the school with some friends for 20 minutes, then left in his Bentley.

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Balotelli was somehow not red-carded when he [stomped](https://youtu.be/6caNpwDYJ98) on Tottenham player Scott Parker's head. But he did receive a four-match ban.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ After scoring the opening goal against Manchester United, Mario pulled up his jersey to reveal a shirt that said, [""WHY ALWAYS ME?""](https://youtu.be/6S3flAAkBO0)

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ He came home from the club‚Äôs U.S. tour and found a bag of two-week old herring rotting in his $250,000 Maserati.
He's known for pranking his teammates, and it appears someone got him back in a gross way.

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Mario had a wide-open goal in a preseason game against the L.A. Galaxy.
But instead of kicking it in, he tried to do a [twirling backheel](https://youtu.be/Ea6t_FCQ6Vc) and missed.
His coach was enraged, and pulled him out of the game on the spot. Balotelli was also enraged and argued with the manager. He replied ""I thought I was offside! B******s,""

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Balotelli became a YouTube hit in the States when he tried and failed for over a minute to put on a bib before warming up in a Europa League game. He struggles to work out which holes are for arms and which holes are for heads.
Eventually, a Man City employee gave him some help, and he was able to get the thing on. [Video](https://youtu.be/lYU-SeVofHs).

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ A youngster asked Balotelli for his autograph after practice one day. When Mario asked him why he wasn't in school, the kid said he was being picked on.
So he drove the boy and his mother to school and gave the bully a talking to. He also met to the headmaster to discuss the issue.

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Favored Man City were eliminated from the Europa League by Kiev.
In the second leg of the clash, Balotelli carelessly flew in to a [tackle like a ninja](https://youtu.be/HVzXYrMP8cc) and spiked a Kiev player in the midsection.
City lost 2-1 on aggregate.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Totti once kicked Balotelli. [Video](https://youtu.be/a0Zsd38GssA). I know Its not a Balotelli moment, but still I added it.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Balotelli is apparently allergic to some kinds of grass, which is problematic if you're a soccer player.
Said his coach after the game, ""I came out a minute before the players and I didn't see Mario. He then said he could play but his face was swollen.""

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Jose Mourinho red card story-
‚ÄúI could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at Inter with Mario, but the book would not be a drama ‚Äì it would be a comedy,‚Äù Mourinho once said.
‚ÄúI remember one time when we went to play Kazan in the Champions League. In that match I had all my strikers injured. No Diego Milito, no Samuel Eto‚Äôo, I was really in trouble and Mario was the only one.
‚ÄúMario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute, so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario.
‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòMario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers on the bench, so don‚Äôt touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.‚Äô
‚ÄúThe 46th minute ‚Äì red card!‚Äù

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Sent to the shops for a bottle of milk by his mother, Mario returns with a Vesper, a trampoline and Scaletrix. Standard.

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Back in 2010 when playing for Inter Milan, Balotelli accepted a gift of an AC Milan shirt, before being snapped wearing it later on.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Perhaps nobody has tried to help Balotelli quite as much as his former Inter and City mentor Roberto Mancini, but the pair famously came to blows at the training ground ‚Äì after Mario put in a nasty challenge on Scott Sinclair.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Balotelli didn't like the new Italy shirt. So he decided to wear the old one in his country's friendly clash with Uruguay in 2011.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Balotelli joked during the World Cup in 2014 that if Italy did England a favour by beating Costa Rica, he‚Äôd have earned a kiss from Her Majesty the Queen.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Balotelli lent his Ferrari to Liverpool fans, so that they could drive it around a car-park.

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Liverpool were 3-0 down to Real Madrid at half-time in a Champions League group clash last season, but inexplicably, the forward thought a tunnel shirt-swap with Pepe was appropriate at half time.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Balotelli's [iconic celebration](https://youtu.be/YJex_WcVt1c) vs Germany.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ He got banned for three matches for getting too many red cards, after which his coach proclaimed he was finished with him for good in an epic rant. Here's what Roberto Mancini had to say:

""I've finished my words for him. I've finished. I love him as a guy, as a player. I know him. He's not a bad guy and is a fantastic player. But, at this moment, I'm very sorry for him because he continues to lose his talent, his quality.""I hope, for him, he can understand that he's in a bad way for his future. And he can change his behavior in the future. But I'm finished. We have six games left and he will not play.""
Mario played in City's final game, and got an assist on their league-winning goal.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ I AM SHIT. After the cup final on live TV, he says: "" I have been sh*t this season, am I allowed say sh*t on TV?

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢ He adopted a stray cat that kept on turing up at the Manchester City training ground.

&amp;nbsp;



‚Ä¢ Had his friend approach girls in a nightclub and say: ""Balotelli will see you now.""

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Handed out ¬£50 notes to strangers when out shopping in Manchester.

&amp;nbsp;


‚Ä¢ Had to be physically hauled away by Javier Zanetti for refusing to let Samuel Eto'o take a penalty that he had earned. 

&amp;nbsp;  


‚Ä¢ Won ¬£25,000 in a casino and promptly gave ¬£1,000 to a tramp outside the casino.   

&amp;nbsp;

‚Ä¢Balotelli was once carrying ¬£5,000 in his back-pocket, and when a police officer asked why he had such a large sum of cash, Balotelli replied, ""Because I am rich.""

‚Ä¢Mario Balotelli was bored and he decided that throwing darts at a youth player was not only safe but a civil thing to do. 

‚Ä¢Mario and his younger brother Enock drove into a women‚Äôs prison in Italy to ""have a look around"".

‚Ä¢ Balotelli and friends set Balotelli's house on fire when a firework was let off in it; later that week, Balotelli was unveiled as Greater Manchester's ambassador for firework safety.

‚Ä¢ In December 2011, Balotelli broke a 48-hour curfew before Manchester City's match against Chelsea to go to a curry house, although he ""was not drinking alcohol, he signed autographs, posed for pictures with fellow diners and was involved in a mock sword-fight using rolling pins"".

‚Ä¢ On 1 December 2014, Balotelli was accused of racism and antisemitism for posting an image on Instagram of the video game character Mario. The image promoted anti-racism by telling others to be like the character, attributing him qualities stereotypically associated with different ethnicities, ending the idea that he ""jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew"". In response to criticisms, he wrote, ""My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please.""

‚Ä¢He proclaimed that he would 'kill' any racists at Euro 2012. ""If someone throws a banana at me in the street, I will go to jail, because I will kill them.""

‚Ä¢ He randomly showed up to a press conference in Italy where a new coach was being introducing at an unrelated team, then left.

‚Ä¢He was fined $400,000 for going to a strip club two nights before a game.

‚Ä¢He stopped at a local high school, used the bathroom and left. He also meandered around the school with some friends for 20 minutes, then left in his Bentley.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli was somehow not red-carded when he [stomped](https://youtu.be/6caNpwDYJ98) on Tottenham player Scott Parker's head. But he did receive a four-match ban.

‚Ä¢ After scoring the opening goal against Manchester United, Mario pulled up his jersey to reveal a shirt that said, [""WHY ALWAYS ME?""](https://youtu.be/6S3flAAkBO0)

‚Ä¢ He came home from the club‚Äôs U.S. tour and¬†found a bag of two-week old herring¬†rotting in his $250,000 Maserati.
He's known for pranking his teammates, and it appears someone got him back in a gross way.

‚Ä¢ Mario had a wide-open goal in a preseason game against the L.A. Galaxy.
But instead of kicking it in, he tried to do a [twirling backheel](https://youtu.be/Ea6t_FCQ6Vc) and missed.
His coach was enraged, and pulled him out of the game on the spot. Balotelli was also enraged and argued with the manager. He replied ""I thought I was offside! B******s,""

‚Ä¢ Balotelli became a YouTube hit in the States when he tried and failed for over a minute to put on a bib before warming up in a Europa League game. He struggles to work out which holes are for arms and which holes are for heads.
Eventually, a Man City employee gave him some help, and he was able to get the thing on. [Video](https://youtu.be/lYU-SeVofHs).

‚Ä¢ A youngster asked Balotelli for his autograph after practice one day. When Mario asked him why he wasn't in school, the kid said he was being picked on.
So he drove the boy and his mother to school and gave the bully a talking to. He also met to the headmaster to discuss the issue.

‚Ä¢ Favored Man City were eliminated from the Europa League by Kiev.
In the second leg of the clash, Balotelli carelessly flew in to a [tackle like a ninja](https://youtu.be/HVzXYrMP8cc) and spiked a Kiev player in the midsection.
City lost 2-1 on aggregate.

‚Ä¢ Totti once kicked Balotelli. [Video](https://youtu.be/a0Zsd38GssA). I know Its not a Balotelli moment, but still I added it.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli is apparently allergic to some kinds of grass, which is problematic if you're a soccer player.
Said his coach after the game, ""I came out a minute before the players and I didn't see Mario. He then said he could play but his face was swollen.""

‚Ä¢ Jose Mourinho red¬†card story-
‚ÄúI could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at Inter with Mario, but the book would not be a drama ‚Äì it would be a comedy,‚Äù Mourinho once said.
‚ÄúI remember one time when we went to play¬†Kazan¬†in the Champions League. In that match I had all my strikers injured. No Diego¬†Milito, no Samuel¬†Eto‚Äôo, I was really in trouble and Mario was the only one.
‚ÄúMario got a yellow card in the 42nd minute, so when I got to the dressing room at half-time I spend about 14 minutes of the 15 available speaking only to Mario.
‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòMario, I cannot change you, I have no strikers on the bench, so don‚Äôt touch anybody and play only with the ball. If we lose the ball no reaction. If someone provokes you, no reaction, if the referee makes a mistake, no reaction.‚Äô
‚ÄúThe 46th minute ‚Äì red card!‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Sent to the shops for a bottle of milk by his mother, Mario¬†returns with a Vesper, a trampoline and Scaletrix. Standard.

‚Ä¢ Back in 2010 when playing for Inter Milan, Balotelli accepted a gift of an AC Milan shirt, before being¬†snapped wearing it later on.

‚Ä¢ Perhaps nobody has tried to help Balotelli quite as much as his former Inter and City mentor Roberto Mancini, but the pair famously came to blows at the training ground ‚Äì after Mario put in a nasty challenge on Scott Sinclair.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli didn't like the new Italy shirt. So he decided to wear the old one in his country's friendly clash with Uruguay in 2011.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli joked during the World Cup in 2014 that if Italy did England a favour by beating Costa Rica, he‚Äôd have earned a kiss from Her Majesty the Queen.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli lent his Ferrari¬†to Liverpool fans, so that they could drive it around a car-park.

‚Ä¢ Liverpool were 3-0 down to Real Madrid at half-time in a Champions League group clash last season, but inexplicably, the forward thought a tunnel shirt-swap with Pepe was appropriate at half time.

‚Ä¢ Balotelli's [iconic celebration](https://youtu.be/YJex_WcVt1c) vs Germany.

‚Ä¢ He got banned for three matches for getting too many red cards, after which his coach proclaimed he was finished with him for good in an epic rant. Here's what Roberto Mancini had to say:

""I've finished my words for him. I've finished. I love him as a guy, as a player. I know him. He's not a bad guy and is a fantastic player. But, at this moment, I'm very sorry for him because he continues to lose his talent, his quality.""I hope, for him, he can understand that he's in a bad way for his future. And he can change his behavior in the future. But I'm finished. We have six games left and he will not play.""
Mario played in City's final game, and got an assist on their league-winning goal.

‚Ä¢ I AM SHIT. After the cup final on live TV, he says: "" I have been sh*t this season, am I allowed say sh*t on TV?

‚Ä¢ He adopted a stray cat that kept on turing up at the Manchester City training ground.

‚Ä¢ Had his friend approach girls in a nightclub and say: ""Balotelli will see you now.""

‚Ä¢ Handed out ¬£50 notes to strangers when out shopping in Manchester.

‚Ä¢ Had to be physically hauled away by Javier Zanetti for refusing to let Samuel Eto'o take a penalty that he had earned.

‚Ä¢ Won ¬£25,000 in a casino and promptly gave ¬£1,000 to a tramp outside the casino.

‚Ä¢ The Italian's car has been impounded 27 times. Seems absurd yet plausible in equal measures.

fnkn1x,PeppaPig85210,Who would rank as the Top 5 GREATEST players of all time? (and explanation),"I put greatest in capitals, because it means overall career wise, not peaks some players had. 

For me the top 5 goes like this: 

5. Cruyff- He won 3 Balon D'ors, carried Holland to 74 WC final, brought glory to Ajax and Barca, and then went on to become one of, if not the most influential manager in history. R9 is very close to him, and could have been 1, if not for injuries.

4. CR7- A machine. 5 Balon D'ors, countless records for Madrid, Portugal. Brought a Euro to Portugal, 4 CL to Madrid, and at times is just a guaranteed goal. He is actually one of, if not, the most clutch player of all time. I only rate the next 2 higher because of personal preference. 

3. Pele- You know the story. WC at 16. Hat trick in semifinal, 2 goals in the final, 3 WC, over 750 goals, and just iconic moments. I dont think kany people on this sub watched Pele, as I didnt. But the stories people tell of him, makes you think he was Hercules. He was the original GOAT, but has since been overtaken, twice.

2. Maradona- Magic. Maradona had that flair and touch that was so perfect. 1986 WC was Maradona at the peak of his powers. Carrying Argentina to the final, on ONE LEG, in 1990 is underrated by most. Not to mention the number of trophies he brought to Napoli. Only footballer to have a religion made after him, AFAIK.

1. Messi- The best. Nobody has played the game like him. He brings a different flair to football. Maybe it's the fact that Ronaldinho said he was better than him at 17. Maybe over 700 goals later, maybe 6 balon dors later, over 30 trophies later, hes finally shown signs of slowing down. Still. 24 goals, 16 assists, in 31 games. Everything has been said about him, but I dont know. 

Given enough time, any sport will have an athlete so good that he makes everyone look like kids.  World class athletes. Just the greatest IMO, of course.",35,1584972882,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fnkn1x/who_would_rank_as_the_top_5_greatest_players_of/,soccer,1

fnih51,braddf96,Draft-related game to play with your friends while you're in isolation.,"So something me and my mates have been doing recently to pass an hour or so each night/every other night is a football draft. 

You use a random list generator to decide the order of your group, last goes twice and the list goes back on itself etc.. 

You pick a theme for each one, so for example we've done all time PL, current prem, English, Home Nations. African XI is planned next. Good thing about this is that there are so many different options you can use.

If you take too long, you miss your go. If you say a player that has already been picked, you miss a go, etc... At the end you all rank each others teams. 

For example, last night we did a home nations XI. You had to pick at least 2 from each country (stopped everyone going for English players) and these are the teams we got:

fnhrdg,dumbwatercba,Bayer Neverkusen,"Bayer Leverkusen. Perhaps the unluckiest side in football.  5-time Bundesliga runners up. The only major titles to their name are a single DFB-Pokal and a UEFA Cup. In the 2001/02 season the nickname Neverkusen was born.
Bayer Leverkusen almost had the league title in the 1999/2000 season. All they needed was a draw on the final day to take the trophy. But on the against Unterhaching on the final day, they were beaten 2-0. With the first goal being an own goal scored by Michael Ballack. Giving the title to Bayern Munich on goal difference
As the 2001-02 season was winding down Leverkusen found themselves in 3 competitions. They were leading the Bundesliga, in the Champions league semi final and had booked their spot in Berlin for the DFB-Pokal final. But into May things took a turn for the worse.
 
How they lost the league
On the 20th of April 2002, Leverkusen were sitting top of the table with a 5-point lead over Dortmund. That day Werder Bremen came to the BayArena and took all 3 points, with a 2-1 win. Their lead had been sliced to 2 points, as Dortmund had scored from the penalty spot in the last minute of their match against Koln to snatch a 2-1 win. On the 27th April it was the penultimate league game. Leverkusen travelled to lowly Nuremberg. The objective was clear don‚Äôt lose. Leverkusen had a far greater goal difference to Dortmund so a point would all but surely give them the title. But at the Max-Morlock-Stadion FC.Nuremberg ran out winners, with Marek Nikl heading home in the 23rd minute. Elsewhere Dortmund had won 4-3 in Hamburg to go top of the table. Leverkusen‚Äôs devastating loss to Nuremberg can be seen as the moment they lost the league. When the 4th of May rolled around Leverkusen needed Werder Bremen to beat Dortmund if they were to have any hope of getting their hands on the title. Alas Dortmund defeated Bremen to win the league with 70 points. Leverkusen had fallen short by a point. Their win against Hertha Berlin had secured second spot but once they lost to Nuremberg it was out of their hands.

How they lost the cup
On the 5th of March, Bayer Leverkusen secured their spot in the final with an extra time win over arch rivals Koln 3-1. In the other semi the next day Schalke knocked out Bayern Munich 2-0 in extra time. In Berlin at the famous Olympiastadion the final of the DFB-Pokal was taking place. 70,000 people gathered to watch Schalke take on Leverkusen on the 11th May. Leverkusen took the lead in the 27th minute through Dimitar Berbatov. Right before a half time Schalke scored directly from a free kick. The second half would be unpleasant for Leverkusen as they conceded 3. A consolation goal was scored by Kirsten in the 89th minute to end the game 4-2 to Schalke.
 
 
How they lost the Champions League
In the 2000/01 season Leverkusen finished 4th earning them a spot in the third qualifying round for next seasons champions league. A 3-0 aggregate win against Red Star Belgrade sent them through to the first group stage. They finished second in a group featuring Barcelona, Lyon and Fenerbahce. In the second group stage they topped a very close group featuring Depotivo La Coruna, Arsenal and Juventus. In the quarters they knocked out Liverpool 4-3 on aggregate. An away goals win followed against Manchester United sending Leverkusen to Glasgow to take on Spanish giants Real Madrid who dispatched Barcelona in the other semi-final.  On the 15th May at Hampden Park, Leverkusen had their final chance to taste glory that season. Leverkusen became the first team to appear in a champions league final without ever winning a national league. Real Madrid were seasoned Champions League veterans with 8 wins under their belt in 11 final appearances. This was Leverkusen‚Äôs first and only Champions league final appearance. The match got under way with Raul netting in the 8th minute. Lucio would respond in the 13th. But in the 45th Zinedine Zidane volleyed it into the top corner. This would go down as one of the greatest goals scored in a Champions League final. The second half would bring no joy for Leverkusen as they couldn‚Äôt find a way through despite Real Madrid being forced into bringing on a 20-year-old Iker Casillas to replace the injured Cesar. Bayer Leverkusen collected their third runners up medal of the season. Completing a silver treble.

Legacy
Bayer Leverkusen haven‚Äôt won a trophy since their DFB-Pokal in 1993. After the 2001/02 season they would go on to lose a cup final to Werder Bremen in 2009 and be runners up to the Bundesliga in 2010/11. At the moment they have a promising team and are in the semi final of the cup against 4th tier Saarbrucken.

The 2002 world cup
5 Leverkusen players were selected in the squad for the 2002 world cup in Japan and South Korea. Germany reached the final and was beaten by Brazil 2-0. Further adding insult to injury as those 5 collected their 4th silver medal that season.",21,1584959381,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fnhrdg/bayer_neverkusen/,soccer,1

Roy Hodgson. Brock. Been around a while. Pretty reliable, not sure if people are laughing with him or at him.

David moyes as karate master koichi. Had potential to be something. Now a bit of a push over on the way to a real challenger.

Sean dyche bruno. Seems like he‚Äôd do ok in a fight. Bit of hard nut and quite good at absorbing attacks.

Brendan rodgers. Lt surge. Just a fuckin wild cunt. Gets loose and plays fast attacking football. First big challenge on the way to the big boys.

Nuno santo as koga. Seems pretty foreign but also dangerous.

Jose mourinho as blaine obiously. Blaine often spoke nonsense to disguise his secret very serious persona.

Pep guardiola. Also blaine. Blaine is the baldest gym leader.

Chris wilder that weird kid who ran a wannabe ground type gym ash faces early on. You think you‚Äôll run all over him bit ends up much tougher than imagined. 

Daniel farke as bug catcher in route 1

Ralph hasenhuttl as agatha. Better than you think they will be. Agatha and austria both start and end in a. Im getting tired now.

Ole solskjar as blue/gary. Can be an easy beat or a nightmare depending how your form is. 

Steve bruce as oak. Bit of a duffer who says some funny things. 

Nigel pearson as lance. Would look good in a cape i imagine. Seems like a well educated man amongst the riff raff. A stepping stone on the way to the top.

Carlo ancelotti as sabrina. High level intellect. Fairly serious person not to be underestimated. 

Frank lampard as giovanni. Similar hair cut and build. Would be a great shout for a james bond villian.

Mikel arteta as lorelei. Probably the only one I wouldn‚Äôt kick out of bed. Looks like they practice good hygiene. Technically in the top 4 but an easy victory to the better teams.

Once again in match day order. 

**SC Paderborn 07 vs 1.FC Koln**

(Koln have played a game more recently than this)

**SC Paderborn 07**

Zingerle - Abra - This man has only won 4 games all season and averages 2 goals against him a game. He must be teleporting away from the ball or some shit.

Jans - Furret - According to Fifa, his best stat is pace. And that's still shit. 

Strohdiek - Sunkern - I searching him up on Wikipedia to see what he was like. His page only had 1 sentence. Clearly no one cares about you. 

Schonlau - Jynx - Jynx is the worst fully evolved pokemon defence wise. Yeah you might be Padorborns best defender, but that's not saying much. 

Collins -  Porygon - You see that absolute thunder cunt he scored against Bayern? He may be shit, useless, and make the fans want to have a seizure. But he's got a bit of special attack about him. 

Proger - Weepinbell - His head is extremely long. 

Fridj√≥nsson - Blipbug - According to SofaScore, he was the worst player for them last game. What a stinker. 

Vasiliadis - Trubbish - Garbage and ugly. 

Antwi-Adjei - Jumpluff - Pretty quick, pretty shit.

Srbeny - Fearow- Second top goalscorer for the team, with 4 goals. Even in a place with little options, he's not the best. 

Michel - Spearow - Like Srbemy but worse.

**Freiburg vs 1. FC Union Berlin**

**Freiburg**

Schwolow - Wooloo - Schwooloowooloowooloo

Gulde - Eiscue - Perfectly square head.

Lienhart - Beldum - Slow, but seems like he could be quite good.

Heintz - Shieldon - Slow, better than Lienhart at the moment. But will be outgrown. 

Schmid - Palossand - Stats wise he actually looks okay. But he's probably shit.

Koch - Ditto - His name is Robin Koch. The dirty slut.

Hofler - Quagsire - Passable in a system. Awful out of it. 

Gunter - Gastrodon - Despite being generally shit. He's had brief glimpses of success. 

Sallai - Caterpie - Still very young, has the potential to become something beautiful.

Petersen - Eelektrik - Actually pretty good but isn't rated by those not in the know. 

Grifo - Quilladin - If I made a list of the most average players, he'd be in it. Same face too.

**1. FC Union Berlin**

Gikiewicz - Bruxish - I always forget he exists, but he's actually not too bad.

Subotic - Golem - Used to be on top of the world. Now can't get out of bed without assistance. 

Schlotterbeck - Alomomola - Just fuck the keyboard up lads.

Friedrich - Golisopod - Got a red card in his last game. Emergency Exit anyone?

Lenz - Minccino - Massive ears.

Andrich - Cinccino - Someone has bigger ears.

Gentner - Nosepass - Similar forehead and nose ratios. 

Trimmel - Golbat - I packed his inform on fifa 5 times in a week. Get out of my packs. But it's an inform so better than a Zubat. 

Bulter - Pachirisu - From the 4th division to bagging twice past Dortmund. Still shit but been a journey. 

Andersson - Blaziken - They are literally the same height. 

Malli - Zorua - 'The next big thing'

**Wolfsburg vs RB Leipzig**

**Wolfsburg**

Casteels - Meowth - I once bought 200 of them for 800 coins and sold them for 6K each on an SBC. Talk about a Pay Day. 

Steffen - Lillipup - Angry little man, resembles a terrier. 

Knoche - Mega Camerupt - He's good, but my god my grandad moves faster and he's dead.

Brooks - Braviary - AMERICA. FUCK YEAH. 

Otavio - Runerigus  - Why did they make it? Someone please tell me.

Mehmedi - Drizzile - I expected so much more from you.

Gerhardt - Ariados - Alright for a while, then just falls off hard. 

Arnold - Galarian Farfetch'd - Surprisingly pretty good. 

Brekalo - Onix - He'll break through this year, honest. 

Weghorst - Zubat - GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY PACKS

Schlager - Spinda - Acts like Spinda after a few Schlagers. 

**RB Leipzig**

Gulacsi - Mr. Mine - Builds an impenetrable wall around his goal. 

Halstenberg - Shuckle - Slow but solid.

Upamecano - Torkoal - Low key a banger.

Klostermann -  Whimsicott - Fast and good at defending. A little suspect on the attack. 

Laimer - Heracross - I feel like he'll turn out good but I can see myself being disappointed. 

Angelino - Scraggy - Jessie Pinkman as fuck. 

Forsberg - Donphan - An absolute belter that gets underappreciated. 

Sabitzer - Kricketune - Same facial hair 

Nkunku - Rhydon - Going to evolve into a massive disappointment. 

Poulsen - Heliolisk - Was better in the early years. Despite being young, he gets worse each time. Same neck vibes. 

Schick - Loudred - He's literally a cube.

**Hertha BSC vs Werder Bremen**

**Hertha BSC**

Kapino - Turtonator - Absolutely massive, not as good as he looks.

Augustinsson - Metapod - Well rounded but not in a good way.

Moisander - Pineco - Good defensively but extremely slow.

Veljkovic - Bouffalant - Same hair. 

Gebre Selassie - Ledian - He isn't that good but I really lie him.

Klaassen - Exeggcute -  The most egg looking head I've ever seen.

Eggestien - Exeggutor - Also looks like an egg, just taller.

Vogt - Alolan Exeggutor - Also looks like an egg, even taller.

Sargent - Smoochum - Both have the same shit hair.

Raschia - Zoroark - The most disappointing shapeshifter.

Bittencourt - Bidoof - Extremely white teeth.

**Bayer 04 Leverkusen vs Eintracht Frankfurt**

**Bayer 04 Leverkusen**

Hradecky - Machamp - Hes good. At times does have 4 hands.

Weiser - Cubone - Looks 18 and 81 at the same time.

Bender - Plusle - Wishes he was as good as his brother.

Tapsoba - Elgyem - Not actually sure the country he is from exists.

Wendell - Sceptile - Fast, decent all rounder, under rated.

Baumgartlinger - Minior - Good at defending half of the time.

Aranguiz - Ursaring - a bit on the slower side but still a unit. Not as good as he once was.

Bellarabi - Ampharos - Electric to watch. People forget about him but he's a banger.

Paulinho - Raticate - Size of them teeth. Good lord.

Diaby - Clobbopuss - Everything about it looks amazing but it'll be a stinker. 

Havertz - Melmetal - Despite being new to the scene, he's already top tier.

Hasebe - Sentret - Quite possibly the slowest thing I've ever seen.

Kohr - Patrat - Just extremely boring.

Kostic - Krokorok - sometimes I think he's amazing. Sometimes I think he's shit.

Rode -  Medicham - Not the best but will fight until the end.

Kamada - The small one on the Alolan Dugtrio - The hair is literally the same shape.

Silva - Tepig - I expected little and was still disappointed.

**FC Schalke 04 vs 1899 Hoffenheim**

**FC Schalke 04**

Shubert - Snom - He has potential but he looks like a baby. 

Becker - Gossifleur - I honestly don't know who this guy is. So he can be a Pokemon I forget about.

Nastasic - Dubwool - I was so excited by you and this is what I got.

Kenny - Litleo - Baby lion, hoping he turns good.

Schopf - Psyduck - Always seems to be hurt.

McKennie - Fletchinder - Already really good. Has the potential to be something incredible.

Matondo - Charmander - Will hopefully evolve into a Welsh Dragon.

Nordtveit - Boldore - Solid option, nothing special.

Grillitsch - Arctovish - His smile looks like a frown.

Skov - Magcargo - better than he gets credit for.

Samassekou - Chansey - He can do a lot. Attacking isn't a part of that.

Kaderabek -  Camerupt - Extremely Underrated.

Kramaric - Honchkrow - In the right environment, he's really good.

**Borussia Dortmund**

Burki - Chesnaught - I know he's good, I just refuse to believe it.

Zagadou - Vikavolt - Looks like he should be quicker than he is.

Hummels - Lapras - A powerhouse of the old guard. Not as good has it was in the past, but still well loved.

Guerreiro - Grapploct - Looks like he should be better

Witsel - Venusaur - Keeps getting better with age.

Can - Beheeyem - Well rounded, can do most things. Occasionally does things from out of this world.

Hakimi -  Sneasel - Extremely fast, has some issues but has still got plenty of to grow.

Hazard - Manectric - Fast and exciting to watch. There are better options, but no one will complain if they have him.

Brandt - Grimmsnarl - Exploded onto the scene and people have seen how good he is already.

Haaland - Rotom - Has the ability to be a world beater if he is used right.

**Bayern Munich vs Augsburg**

**Bayern Munich**

Neuer - Marshadow - The best sweeper.

Pavard - Kingdra - I always thought it would have gone better for him.

Boateng -  Toxapex - What he lacks in speed he more than makes up for in defensive ability.

Alaba - Cloyster - Great defensive abilities. Can be used on the attack. Can be used as a support.

Davies - Jolteon - Very fast, looks like a live wire. Probably won't become the best but will be a fantastic option.

Kimmich - Groudon - An absolute beast. Hard to find anyone better than him. He can do it all. Will be a legend.

Thiago - Serperior - So slick in everything he does. Very well rounded and well loved.

Gnabry - Hitmontop. He must have 3 legs to perform the dizzying runs he does. 

Muller - Clefable - Came from space to support everyone. 

Coutinho - Scolipede - I have high hopes for you, they were misguided. Like most of your shots.

Zirkzee - Xurkitree - I've never heard of him so I can't really compare. Just similar names

(Honourable Mention because I know you'll want it) Lewandowski - Deoxys Attack Forme - He won't defend but he'll beat you all on the attack. 

**Augsburg**

Luthe - Trapinch  - Small face. Big head.

Iago - Maractus - Looks shit and forgettable so far.

Jedvaj - Mega Ampharos - L'Oreal because you're worth it. 

Gouweleeuw - Beartic -  Same shit beard.

Framberger - Spewpa - At the stage where I could be good, but isn't.

Baier - Slowpoke - I swear all the midfielders in Bundesliga are slow.

Khedira - Dedenne - The clone no one cared about.

Max - Applin - Could be either a defender or an attacker. Let's see how he plays out.

Lowen - Cryogonal - Pretty shit but an absolute unit.

Richter - Quilava - Kinda fast but not great at anything. Potential to get better.

Niederlechner - Toxicroak - Actually doing pretty good, but I can't see him being much better than this.

**1. FSV Mainz 05 vs Fortuna Dusseldorf**

**1. FSV Mainz 05**

Zentner - Eiscue Noice Face - For some reason he's really fast. Extremely round head.

Pierre-Gabriel - Purrloin - I'm going to guess he wont turn out great.

Bruma - Lickitung - I don't know why anyone would ever use it.

Niakhate - Shieldon - I feel like he could be good, but he won't be.

Baku - Avalugg - The top of his head seems to just cut off. Perfectly straight haircut.

Latza - Hariyama  - He's shit, but not that shit.

Barreiro - I don't know who this guys is. I randomly generated and got Yanma. I don't make the rules. Well I do, but still.

Mwene  - Shiinotic - Apparently defending is his best aspect. No one believes that.

Onisiwo - Teddiursa - Tries to be fierce, no one is fooled.

Mateta - Spoink - Always got a ball on his head.

Quaison - Quagsire - I thought he was going to be shit but he's actually amazing.

**Fortuna Dusseldorf**

Kastnmeier - Sandygast - Staring in a team with 6 goalkeepers means he must have something about him. It's a shame he has the same presence as some sand would in goal. 

Suttner - Garbador - Old, washed up. No one wants it.

Giesselmann - Mienfoo - Shit. Has a very high jump (kick)

Hoffmann - Dottler - I'm starting to run out of slow Pokemon. 

Ayhan - Honedge - He's slow. But he's actually not too bad and could get better.

Zimmermann - Venonat - Eyes looking in all directions. 

Thommy -  Carvanha - Couldn't defend against me, and I'm shit.

Bodzek -  Ferroseed - Surely there aren't many slow midfielders left? He's decent at defending though.

Stoger - Cosmog - Somehow the best and worst player on the team.

Berisha - Seviper - A tricky, slippery little fucker.

Karaman - Drapion - Capable of pulling out decent performances after being bad for a while.

**Borussia M'Gladbach vs 1. FC Koln**

I've lost the will to live.

**Borussia M'Gladbach**

Sommer - Graveler - A rock with 4 hands.

Lainer - Blissey - Has unreal stamina, will last for ages. Ladies form an orderly cue. 

Ginter - Cofagrigus - Like everyone in this league, he's slow but good at defending. 

Elvedi - Fraxure - Reasonably quick, good at his job. Plenty of time to improve still. 

Wendt - Hypno - Oscar Wendt to the shops and didn't come home, because Hypno lured him away. 

Kramer - Omastar - Oh look. Another guy who's slow and cant shoot. But is for some reason good at defending. 

Strobl - Wishiwashi Solo Form - He look a bit like me. I'm shit, so he must be too.

Herrmann - Rhyhorn - Not as good as he used to be. Still good though.

Embolo - Luxio - Will you please just get good already, I really like you. 

Thuram - Buzzwole - He's a fucking tank.

Plea - Regigigas - Slow off the mark but something special when he gets going.

**1. FC Koln**

Horn - Keldeo - Actually good. has a horn. Idk I've given up. 

Schmitz - Togepi - He just looks scared all the time.

Leistner - Voltorb - Shiny round head. Not very good

Mere - Comfey - Looks like the kinda guy to wear flower necklaces on holiday

Ehizibue - Koffing - I haven't made the 'lol dutch people get high' joke yet. 

Hector - Growlithe - The most loyal companion

Skhiri - Drednaw - Slow, shit, massive mouth.

Jakobs - Lovedisc - Does anyone know who this is?

Uth - Volbeat - Looks 21 and 31 at the same time.

Kainz - Shelgon - Very well rounded but you thought he'd be better by now. 

Cordoba - Gumshoos - Gumshoos with black hair.

That was painful. Never again. If you want to see more do it yourself.

fn83gi,stella__art,Cercle Brugge and the 'Greatest Escape of the Decade',"During this period of boredom and isolation I have decided to write about my beloved 'Cercle Brugge' and -what √å believe is- the greatest ever escape from relegation. I will write in 'we' and 'us' just to make things easier. 

Cercle Brugge are the 12th oldest team in Belgium, located in Bruges with a small but ever so loyal following. Found in 1899 inside the high school I attended.

  
In my 11 years time of holding a season ticket (I'm 18), I have been through every emotion watching Cercle Brugge, from finishing 4th in the 1st division and 2 (lost) Cup Finals in Brussels to narrowly avoiding relegation in 2017. Only to get promoted back to 1st division less than a year later through a 89th minute penalty.

However, this season has been by far the most intense for us Cercle Brugge fans. 

As some of you may know, AS Monaco owns us. They send a bunch of loanees to Bruges each year to help them develop.

Now to the footballing part. We started the season off with only 3 points from the first 10 games. At this point the manager Fabien Mercadal got the sack and was replaced by Bernd Storck, who helped Moeskroen avoid relegation the season before. 

For clarity: 16 teams, 30 gameweeks and bottom 1 gets relegated

From the moment Storck arrived the trainings doubled and became more intense, a lot of players burnt out and were never seen again on the pitch for the remainder of the season. It was clear that Storck meant business. Cercle got praise from nearly every pundit in the country for their attacking and pressing style of play, but 1 thing remained missing: the actual points.

In the next 14 games (so matchday 24 of 30) we only won 8 points and were deadset for relegation. We weren't even included in the list for TV revenue for the next season, that should give you an indicator on how bleak things looked for us at that moment. 9 points away from safety with 6 games to go (including 2 games against the top 2 in the league)

&amp;#x200B;

[MATCHDAY 24 OF 30](https://preview.redd.it/xe3ttet6nao41.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4f238f3a484d8def8eef032133b66f9fe3274b3)

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, we played KV Mechelen at home, who were 6th in the league. We won that game 3-2 thanks to a 90th minute banger from outside the box. The players started to believe again and so did the fans.

After the KV Mechelen game we had 2 away games in front of us, Sint Truiden and Moeskroen. The fans believed in the team again and we sold out both away games, even buying some of the empty home stands. 

We narrowly won both of them 0-1 and somehow we weren't bottom of the league anymore, that dreaded spot we were in for the large majority of the season. We were ahead of Waasland-Beveren, both 20 points but we were ahead based on 'won games' (which is the first tiebreaker). A nice video from the Moeskroen game: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMXgcSROKs&amp;t=204s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaMXgcSROKs&amp;t=204s)

Now, we weren't quite there yet, 3 games to go and the next two were Gent at home and club brugge away in the derby. 

Both Waasland-Beveren and Oostende lost their games so we went into the Gent game with a lot of pressure but also hunger. We beat Gent 1-0 thanks to a goal after 25 seconds. We had now won the past 4 games, after only winning 3 in the previous 24(!).

1 week later was the Bruges derby, We were the away team so we knew this would be an extremely hard fixture, club brugge might have lost 5-0 to Man Utd (lol) but they are bossing the Belgian league at the moment. All games were played at the same time because this was the 29th of the 30 games.

We would be safe in this matchday IF: we matched Waasland-Beveren's result. They played Moeskroen. We lost the Derby 2-1, BUT Waasland-Beveren lost as well so we celebrated safety in the away derby, which was special to say the least, especially if you see where we came from. Nice little video from the away derby: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxWkSa3dotU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxWkSa3dotU)

fn80lt,GeddyLee15,Which Brasileir√£o Serie A club is the closest to a steakhouse/churrascaria?,"If there is one brazilian culinary tradition that's massively practiced, it's the churrasco. Fire grilled, medium rare steak served with a freezing cold glass of beer. Usually adopting the eat-all-you-can system, also known as rod√≠zio, the churrascaria is the ultimate temple of good brazilian food.  So, which of the 20 teams at the Brasileir√£o Serie A has to walk less to enjoy a fine picanha mal passada pingando de gordura? 

\-All teams are sorted in alphabetical order;

\-The farthest team to a steakhouse is Gremio, at a whopping 2610m to the closest maminha. The closest team to a steakhouse is Coritiba, with the steakhouse *built-in* the stadium complex;

\-All of the chosen steakhouses are eat-all-you-can/rod√≠zio. There might be closer restaurants to the stadiums but none are eat-all-you-can;

\-I am really bored, as you can see.

fn7e2w,displacedindavis,Some nice home records certain teams have against specific opponents (Part I: Big 5 and Portugal),"The best teams also have some of the best home field advantages in the sport. And that means that collectively, it becomes difficult for teams to win at certain stadiums (and, in many cases, even draw).

I can easily get sucked into doing this, so I'll be limiting myself to just a few historically notable teams for now. Sorry if I didn't include your favorite team, feel free to suggest your own in the comments but as indicated in the title, I hope to continue this series in the future. I may even consider a database to store all the results. I looked at data from [worldfootball.com](https://worldfootball.com), but do realize that data may be quite spotty for some early years. Actually, I would welcome suggestions as to a more reliable database for H2H records if one exists.

Entries are as such: *home record* against *team* (*last home loss to said team*) since *first year in which data exists for said matchup on worldfootball.com*. I realize now that I used the American M-D-Y system. Hope it's not too confusing.

Finally, I realize that my lists for Premier League teams are shorter on average. I'm suffering a bit of a burnout from looking at Premier League stats, so I just wanted to get something new into the picture.

Without further ado, here we go.

* 33-20-5 against Bordeaux (1-2 loss on May 4, 2008) since 1945-46
   * While I'll skip Bordeaux for this portion, this H2H has seen insane home domination on both sides. You already know Bordeaux has only 5 wins in Marseille, but Marseille actually has it even worse in Bordeaux: they're 4-20-35 at Bordeaux. Since said road win by Bordeaux at Marseille in 2008, the home team in this matchup has earned at least a point in the next 24 matchups and counting, including both games this season.

**Benfica**:

* Before I go on, there are a ton of ridiculously lopsided matchups in Portugal so I'm going to have to be very selective here. Use the comments section to suggest any other matchup though I may also get to them in a later part.
* 41-3-3 against Academica (1-2 loss on August 15, 2010) since 1938-39
* 47-9-4 against Belenenses (2-3 loss on April 16, 2000) since 1939-40
   * Admittedly, the Belenenses SAD currently in the Primeira Liga is often viewed as an unlawful representation of the original. However, *technically* it split off from that one as well which is why their games are counted as well.
* 47-3-2 against against Braga (0-1 loss on February 15, 2020) since 1955-56
* 29-12-4 against Boavista (0-3 loss on March 14, 1999) since 1959-60

* 51-8-6 against Vitoria de Guimaraes (0-1 loss on March 14, 2009) since 1958-59
   * I realize that the 2013 Taca Final was basically a home game for Benfica but it wasn't played at their home stadium so *technically* it was a neutral-site game. Benfica lost to Vitoria de Guimaraes 1-2.
* 50-8-2 against Vitoria de Setubal (0-1 loss on August 30, 1987) since 1955-56

**Porto**:

* 38-6-2 against Boavista (0-1 loss on November 20, 2004) since 1959-60
* 49-7-4 against Braga (1-2 loss on January 17, 2020) since 1955-56
   * You probably noticed that Braga won at both Benfica *and* Porto this season. The odds of that happening are pretty low so it's kind of nice to see. Sadly, Braga could not pull off the Big 3 road sweep as they dropped their road game against Sporting.
* 38-2-1 against Maritimo (1-3 loss on December 29, 2015) since 1977-78
* 48-11-4 against Vitoria de Guimaraes (2-3 loss on August 25, 2018) since 1958-59

**Sporting CP**:

   * They basically played a home game in the 2012 Taca Final but it was played at a neutral site. They lost 0-1

fn68kr,yeskevinlad277,"Garth Crooks Team Of The Season: Van Dijk, De Bruyne, Vardy","Because the season has come to a standstill and I have nothing better to do on a Sunday evening I have trawled through each of Garth Crooks' Teams of the Week to determine what his Team of the Season would be. I was originally going to present it in Garth's preferred formation of 3-4-3 (he's used this formation in 18 of his 24 teams of the week this season) but because of the way I've calculated it, it would be unfair to use it.

**How the Team of the Season has been calculated:**

Positions are picked based on amount of times a player has been selected in a specific **position**. So for example Mason Mount has been selected twice; once as a midfielder and once as a forward. This would count as one point for each position, not two points overall.

**Team Of The Season**

*Ederson* (5)

*Van Dijk* (7) - Maguire (6) - Cahill (4) - Fernandinho (4)

Grealish (5) - *De Bruyne* (11) - Bruno Fernandes (4)

Aubameyang (5) - Vardy (5) - *Mane* (7)

*italics* show that this player was picked the most in that position.

**Selection facts:**

Ederson (5) pipped Ben Foster (4) to the goalkeeping slot. Alisson was never picked but stand-in goalkeeper Adrian featured twice. Even Pickford made it.

Defenders was a closely fought contest with Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Dunk, Pereira, Holgate and Schar being selected three times.

Henderson, Cantwell, Maddison, Silva and Traore were all selected three times. Bruno Fernandes was selected in four successive Teams of the Week (2nd Feb 2020-8th March 2020) which lead to his inclusion.

Aguero, Abraham and Rashford were all eyeing that striker spot with four selections each. Perhaps Rashford would have made it had he not been injured. Martial also featured three times.

**Other interesting facts**

Liverpool would have been Garth's choice for overall team of the season with 38 players making the cut overall. City were close behind with 35 selections.

8th placed Spurs (17) featured more players than 3rd placed Leicester (16).

12th placed Everton (12) and 13th placed Newcastle (13) featured more players than Wolves (9) and Sheffield United (9), who are 6th and 7th respectively.

Burnley have seen the fewest players selected, with only 4 players chosen. These were Nick Pope (2), Dwight McNeil (1) and James Tarkowski (1).

Aston Villa players have been selected 6 times. 5 of these were Jack Grealish.

His Team of the Week on the 27th October was the first time he'd ever chosen 3 players who'd scored a hat trick.

fn3hgi,ImFranny,"Bar√ßa is playing again! New week, new games, as Bar√ßa plays 2 matches ... in Rocket League","*The stream is live right now on http://www.twitch.tv/rocketleague*
! And the first match starts in about 5-10 minutes.

Rocket League is a football Esport. People might be interested due to the quarantine since we all can‚Äôt leave our homes.  It‚Äôs all online and the casters are also currently casting each one from their own home.

Today in season 9 of the [Rocket League Championship Series](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/Season_9/Europe) (or RLCS for short), in the European League play, [Bar√ßa]( https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/FC_Barcelona) is facing off against two teams. First we get Bar√ßa versus [Team Solo Mid]( https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Team_SoloMid), and about 1 hour and a half later, [Mousesports]( https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Mousesports).


**The game**

Rocket League is a fast-paced car football game, played 3v3 in a closed arena (has a ceiling), and where players are rocket-powered cars that can fly. Despite the car part, the game actually has a lot of depth with the real 3rd dimension created by the flying cars, and the fact that you can't fly indefinitely (you need to pick up boosts around the pitch to fill your tank). The game is not boring since most games are fast-paced, mechanical proficient players can make crazy shots (from odd angles) and the games are also quick. Each match is played in a series, which means the best of 5 games. Games are 5 minutes and only end when the ball touches the ground (which means sometimes games might last a few extra seconds if the ball is flying) which creates tension and enthusiasm in some specific situations, when teams are tied or there is only 1 goal different. There are no tie games. If the 5 minutes end and teams are tied, they move into overtime where the first to score (tension) wins the game. A great example of tension would be the best goal ever in Rocket League, the goal by Jstn in the season 5 Worlds grand finals.



**The team**

FC Barcelona is now entering their 3rd season of RLCS and have become a staple of the European League. They were predicted to have a subpar season as they decided to replace the European MVP of last season by an unproven and controversial prospect, but have defied all expectations and are now placed 3rd in the standings with 5 wins and 2 losses.

**The players**

Aldin Ronaky Hodzic (19, Denmark), aka Luis Suarez. A pure striker. Often doubted for his ability to really contribute to the play he, much like the Uruguayan, is however clinical in front of the goal.

David Deevo Morrow (19, England), aka Marc Andre Ter Stegen. A tremendous defender and goalkeeper, winning games with his saves like MAtS.

Hrant Flakes Yakoub (19, Netherlands), aka Frenkie De Jong. He really likes to keep the ball under control, and to start plays from deep inside, with a great vision and a midfield activity resembling his countryman.

fn2jsn,JavBG17,Could the Mongol Empire win the World Cup?,"The Mongol Empire, the largest contiguous land empire in history. At its peak it had an area of a whopping 24 million km^(2), covering over 17% of the worlds land. In other words, it was a big fucker, and it was led by one of the biggest fuckers going, Genghis Khan, who unified several Mongol tribes in order to start this dynasty.

Big G was definitely a savage one, raping, pillaging and killing anyone and anything that dared to stop him. It is said that he raped so many women, and fathered so many children, that anyone with blue eyes can trace their lineage back to him. I don't actually know if that's true or not but I don't really care.

Khan was a tactical genius, winning battles left and right, capturing the lands and increasing the size of his empire. He revolutionised the war game by deploying his archers on horseback, having lighter armour to increase mobility, and getting the people from the lands he captured an opportunity to fight for him. He did however get fucked up by Japan a couple times because he could not navigate the Sea.

Genghis ruled the lands from Eastern Europe all the way to Eastern Asia. It is debated what modern day countries is empire covered but most lists include: Mongolia (his homeland), China, North Korea, South Korea, Iran, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Northern parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Persia, Ukraine, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, some of Romania, Hungary and Belarus, and much or all of Russia

So the important question is could they win the World Cup? Let's take a look at their potential line up (note that my knowledge of Asian football is very limited and I didn't really want to look it up):

\------------------------- Ugurcan Cakir -----------------------

\-M. Fernandes--- Demiral---Soyuncu---Zinchenko-

\--------------------- Dzagoev --------Yokuslu--------------------

\----Yarmolenko---------Son------------------Cheryshev---

\----------------------------------Dzyuba---------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Goalkeeper:

Probably the best choice between the sticks. Other options include Andrii Lunin and Andrey Lunev,  

Defenders:

Mario Fernandes, Merih Demiral, Caglar Soyuncu, Oleksandr Zinchenko 

Probably the area I know the least about for these countries, but Turkey have a couple of decent centre backs that have impressed. Demiral was going to miss the Euros this year but it looks like he might be able to play them after all.

Midfielders:

Andriy Yarmolenko, Alan Dzagoev, Okay Yokuslu, Denis Cheryshev

Strong competition on the wings and attacking midfield but didn't really too many high quality defensive midfielders, some decent picks either way. Other options include Aleksandr Golovin,  Henrikh Mkhitaryan, , Ifran Can Kaheveci, Konoplyanka (Is he still relevant?), Ki Sung Yong, and Ianis Hagi

Strikers:

Son Heung Min, Artem Dzyuba

Big and little. Perfect Combination.  Not as strong competition as midfield, went for these two as I think Son could play of Dzyuba quite well. Other candidates include Wu Lei, George Puscas, Hwang Hee Chan, and Alireza Jahanbakhsh.

So could the mongol empire have won the world cup? Probably not. Not now anyway, maybe in the past when Romania was a better footballing country back in the 90s or when Hungary ruled world football, but as of right now I would say they could probably make the quarter finals, if everyone is up for it.",23,1584895236,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fn2jsn/could_the_mongol_empire_win_the_world_cup/,soccer,1

fn1n9e,dumbwatercba,The San Marino National Team,"San Marino. The oldest country in the world and the fifth smallest. Home to just over 30,000 people. When it comes to their favourite sport, they are quite possibly the worst in the world.

Why are they the worst?

As of the February 2020 FIFA world rankings they sit at 209th. Narrowly above the British territory of Anguilla. Since they joined FIFA in 1988. They have won just one game.  A 1-0 win over Lichtenstein. Additionally, they have managed 4 draws. Most notably in 1993 when they drew with Turkey in a World Cup qualifying game. In their 164 games played they have managed just 24 goals while conceding 693. This abysmal record makes them a strong contender for the worst national team in the world.

The Famous Win

On the 28th April 2004. A miracle occurred at the Stadio Olimpico. Not the one in Rome but the one in Serravalle.  San Marino won their first game. To this day it is still their only win. In front of a crowd of 700. San Marino secured a win in a friendly against Lichtenstein. Thanks to a goal by Sammarinsese record goal scorer Andy Selva. He holds the record with 8 goals. He is one of two players to score more than 1 goal for the San Marino. 2 years on they suffered their biggest defeat, at the hands of Germany 13-0.

Unusual Records

Up until 2016 San Marino held the record for the fastest goal in World Cup history. During the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifying round, England came face to face with San Marino in the final round of fixtures. Qualification for England looked unlikely as they sat in third behind Norway and the Netherlands. Earlier in the campaign England had demolished them 6-0 at Wembley. When England played away against San Marino in Bologna. After just 8.33 seconds Davide Gualtieri slotted past David Seamen. This record was beaten in 2016 by Belgian forward Benteke against Gibraltar in a 6-0 win which was timed at 8.1 seconds. A more bizarre record they hold is for having twins score own goals in the same game. In 2010 Aldo and Davide Simoncini scored own goals in a defeat to Sweden.
 
San Marino can be excused for their poor footballing record due to being a country with a population a third of the capacity of Wembley. Almost every player to have represented San Marino have had jobs. The country is only 61 square kilometres in size. Additionally, they compete in Europe which has a higher level of competition compared to the other continental confederations. As one of the smallest countries in the world on size and population and a team made up mostly of part timers. It can be said they have performed fairly well.",1,1584891762,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fn1n9e/the_san_marino_national_team/,soccer,1

fn18tn,Shanal183,"[OC] Players with highest recorded assists at League level, at UCL, at World Cup and the entirety of their careers","Just a comparison of players who've statistically provided the most assists throughout different competitions.

&amp;#x200B;

[Players with most recorded career assists](https://preview.redd.it/74unlgd528o41.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19915a32a864bb194f1bfe6e43a9e410fa7a098d)

This is considering their entire career. Messi, Suarez, and Ozil, in that order, have the highest amount of recorded assists. Meanwhile the highest assists per game ratios (at least within these ten) also belong to these three, except in the reverse order.

&amp;#x200B;

[Players with most recorded assists in the history of World Cup](https://preview.redd.it/odiupzrt48o41.png?width=513&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53149d99779d00c066513ff955eced9c23ca1236)

These are the players with highest amount of World Cup assists that I could find. Pele leads in the number of assists, followed by Messi and Schweinsteiger. Ratio pretty much rolls in same manner, except push Messi to the third spot, while putting Beckham at second.

I tried my best to look into old (past century) players- though there's always a chance I missed someone as I only researched either very well-known players, or the players with a lot of WC appearances.

&amp;#x200B;

[Players with most league assists](https://preview.redd.it/sylr9j2d28o41.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28c1d66bcbb1e98ec5f3752d2468c429bba385dd)

These are the players with highest amount of league assists in records. Messi has the highest number at 181, while Suarez has the best ratio at about 0.37.

&amp;#x200B;

[Players with most assists in the history of UEFA Champions League](https://preview.redd.it/pwtpfcgf28o41.png?width=515&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7acca35fc225f6459d4a6dbd527740ff3cc4e86)

And finally, the players with highest number of recorded assists in the UCL. Cristiano Ronaldo dethrones Messi for the highest amount, meanwhile Suarez apparently has the best ratio by far. Di Maria also appears to be quite a good bit ahead of everyone else when it comes to ratio.

That'd be that! Messi appears to be the best, and the most consistent goal provider- appearing in all four of the lists, all while topping two of those. Meanwhile Suarez has been very consistent in terms of ratios, topping two of the lists, and being the second highest within the third list. Ozil's ratios have also been pretty nice.

On another note; Giggs was definitely the assist king of his time.

**Sources:** Transfermarkt, Whoscored, Wikipedia, UEFA official website, and a few The Guardian and The Independent, etc articles for WC assist stats of old'ish players.

In 1968, after the Israeli team lost a coin toss to Bulgaria national team in the quarterfinals of the Mexico Olympics, Dagan and Michael Almog felt that it was appropriate to have a more fair way to decide knockout games.

The two came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe penalty shoot-out, formally drafted it and passed it on to FIFA representatives. Stanley Ross, FIFA president, then looked for a different method to decide games and happily adopted the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDagan and Almog. In June 1970, the proposal was approved. In 1999, Dagan was awarded the UEFA award for his invention and his contribution to the industry.

He came up with the idea of the penalty shootout and submitted it to FIFA, and by June 1970 it was accepted into the rulebook. The first shootout took place between Manchester United and Hull City in the semifinals of the Watney Cup (United won), with the first player taking a kick being George Best.

He was a family friend, and yesterday he took his final breath at 93 years old. Whether or not you like penalties, they are almost universally accepted as better than every method used before, and since their introduction have supplied some of the sport's most iconic and dramatic moments.

fmxfq4,alienkidxnzm,The one player you'll never be sold on?,"Which is that player who no matter how well he performs (according to statistics or any measure), you just feel is not good enough or overrated? 

A lot of the times statistics hide the actual performance of a player. Key passes missed, goals which could've been scored by the opposition due to poor positioning/give aways, deceiving the referee etc.

**For me**, it's Dominic Calvert-Lewin. I feel the only thing good about him is the work rate and will to fight for every ball (which is just what's needed some of the time) but on a whole, I just can't understand how he's being backed for a place in the Euro squad. From what I've seen, he has a weak shot, very weak passing, poor composure and dives a lot. He's scored decent amount of Ghosh's but missed so many opportunities and passes which could've led to an easy chance.

Again, it's just personal opinion. I hope no one is offended by the comments or this post. Cheers!",1567,1584870473,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fmxfq4/the_one_player_youll_never_be_sold_on/,soccer,1

Although it is of course sad to see any of our subscribers       struggling with their health - be it mental or physical - we have been greatly encouraged to see how supportive our community has been regarding these issues, and heartened that people have found /r/soccer a safe place in which they feel able to open up regarding issues which sadly do remain stigmatised in society at large. 

Regardless of the colour of your shirt (or the flair next to your username) we are all living, breathing human beings - and we all love the beautiful game. Everyone on /r/soccer deserves to be happy and well - so be kind. It can be a tough old world out there, and that kindness can go a long way.

fmw8ui,Fedboy,"[OC] Mario Mandzukic, Zinedine Zidane- only two players to score in both a UCL final and a WC final this century. Curiously, their names are alliterations.","Does this tell us that your name must be an alliteration for you to score in the finals of the most prestigious tournaments at both the club and international level? 

Going backwards from 2018 WC, lets have a look at the players who have played and scored in the World Cup-

Antoine Griezmann (AG): Scored in the 2018 WC final but couldn‚Äôt score in the 2016 CL final for Atletico Madrid even when he took a penalty. 

Paul Pogba (PP): Scored in the 2018 WC final but couldn‚Äôt score in the 2016 CL final. This shows us that having an alliterated name isn‚Äôt a guarantee to score in both the finals. Yet.

Kylian Mbappe (KM): Scored in 2018 WC final, hasn‚Äôt appeared in a CL final. Yet. 

Ivan Perisic (IP): Scored in the 2018 WC final, hasn‚Äôt appeared in a CL final. Yet. 

Mario Mandzukic (MM): Scored in the 2018 WC final, twice. For both the teams. Scored an amazing overhead kick in the 2017 CL final for Juventus. Also scored in the 2013 CL final for Bayern Munich Top stuff.

Mario Gotze (MG): Scored the only goal in the 2014 WC final. Wasn‚Äôt able to play the 2013 CL final. Hasn‚Äôt scored in a CL final. Yet.

Andres Iniesta (AI): Scored the only goal in the 2010 WC final. Has played 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015 CL finals. Hasn‚Äôt scored in the CL final. Yet.

Mario Materazzi (MM): Scored in the 2006 WC final. Played the 2010 CL but didn‚Äôt score. Coincidentally, he replaced Diego Milito, who scored both of Inter‚Äôs goals. Confirms that an alliteration isn‚Äôt a guarantee to get you a goal in both these finals.

Zinedine Zidane (ZZ): Scored a paneka penalty in 2006 WC final against prime Buffon (absolute shithousery). Scored in the 2002 CL final with an amazing weak foot volley. 

Ronaldo (R): Scored two goals in the 2002 WC final. Surprisingly, he hasn‚Äôt played a CL final. Yet. 

Some players who have scored in the CL finals, played the WC final but could not score include: 

Lionel Messi, Arjen Robben, Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso, Thomas Muller et al. Interestingly, majority of these players either belong to Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich. 


The analysis shows us that having an alliterated name is necessary to score in both the CL and WC finals, though it isn‚Äôt a guarantee as seen in the case of Mario Materrazi and Paul Pogba. 

An unforeseen inference from the analysis is also that if your name is Mario, you have a high chance of scoring in the WC final. 

Also, having Mario Mandzukic in the CL or WC finals guarantees that there will be multiple goals. Lad has scored 3 different finals for 4 different teams.

fmvtg4,AlcoholicSocks,Each Premier League sides last starting 11 as Pokemon.,"The lack of football has driven me to madness.

Enjoy this list of footballers if they were Pokemon. Or don't, I don't care anymore. Done in match order.

**Liverpool vs Bournemouth**


**Liverpool**

Adrian - Gliscor - Much like ash getting Gliscor, this was a surprising addition to a good team. Is bang average but does his job.

Trent Alexander Arnold - Scorbunny - Despite being new, it feels like he's been here for ages. Everyone that starts with Scorbunny likes it. Everyone that didn't start with it pretends to hate it but low-key likes it. 

Joe Gomez - Toxapex - Relatively new to the scene but still has some decent experience. Established itself as a good defensive option.

Virgil Van Dijk - Steelix - Been around for ages, everyone that's used it has loved it. Everyone against it hates it. That 200 defence stat is just about good enough to match Van Dijk. 

Milner - Ditto - Milner is a footballing slut and can play in any position for any team.  

Alex Oxlade Chamberlain  - Diggersby - Always seems on the cusp of greatness, before something about the meta makes it a rotation option. Always something just better than it but a great option to have. Has big ears. 

Fabinho - Forretress - Fantastic defensive option. round shiny head.

Wijnaldum - Crawdaunt - Sometimes forgotten about by people not fans. Underrated and everyone actually likes it. 

Salah - Lucario - Top Tier, based on an Egyptian god. 

Firmino - Umbreon - Keeps everything ticking over. Usually outshined by the other attackers but is the key supporting member.

Mane - Pyroar - Has a Mane. 


**Bournemouth**

Ramsdale - Pincurchin - New to the scene, forgot it existed. 

Smith - Escavalier - Been around a fair amount of time, was shit, transfer evolved him. Now decent.

Ake - Zoroark - So much hype. Wasted. 

Cook - Accelgor - Been around a fair amount of time, was shit, transfer evolved him. Now decent.

Stacey - Pyukumuku  - I don't know who this is either. 

Lerma  - Ferrothorn - Seems to have been around ages but is still relatively young. Pretty good defensively. 

Stanislas - Magcargo - People think it's younger that it is. Has it's moments, otherwise just exists. 

Cook - Golisopod - Actually pretty good. Annoying face.

Billing - Sandaconda -  Young and deceptively tall. Actually good but no one cares.

Fraser - Appletun - Unexpectedly small.  Actually good but no one cares.

Wilson - Sableye - Always had the potential, mega evolved into something really good a few years ago. Not been the same since.

**Southampton vs Newcastle**


**Southampton**

McCarthy - Onix - Old reliable. Never quite hit the heights it could have but still well loved.

Valery - Muk - Why don't you Muk backwards on over, Valery?

Stephens - Farfetch'd - Used to be given away. Finally found a place to thrive.

Bednarek - Galar Stunfisk - Unexpectedly appeared. Unexpectedly okay. 

Bertrand - Skarmory - Had a few moments of joy, being in championship winning sides. Been replaced by younger, sexier, foreign options. 

Boufal - Snivy - Cocky, silky fucker. No end product. 

Ward-Prowse - Mimikyu  - Not sure of this is Milner, Beckham or Ward Prowse. 

Hojbjerg - Slaking - Had everything set up to be a class option. Something held it back. Still fantastic at moments.

Djenpo -  Dracozolt - An absolute shambles.

Long - Seaking - Been around for an age, keeps getting picked and no one knows why.

Rose - Starmie - Used to be good. Gotta respect it still.

Fernandez - Slowpoke - Does he know how to run?

Lascelles - Gengar - Will beat you up, take your lunch money, and shag your misses. Also really fucking good. 

Manquillo - Vivillion - Just a bit of a gimmick. 

Saint-Maximin - Flygon - So much potential. Everyone praying it gets better.

Shelvey - Electrode - Round and shiny. Tendency to explode.

Hayden - Tropius - Just there to make up numbers.

Ritchie - Alolan Vulpix - I want to like it, but I dont.

Almiron - Absol - Older than people think. Not as good as people think. 

Gayle - Dunsparce - I'm sure he has a purpose. We just haven't found it despite years of trying.

**Sheffield United vs Norwich**


**Sheffield United**

Henderson - Cofagrigus - Appears out of no where with more arms than he should have. 

Basham - Pachirisu - I don't know how it got this good, but it did. Has won 1 title. Still a shock.

O'Connell - Bouffalant - Can't decide if I rate it or not.

Baldock -  Ursaring - Average all over the board.

Norwood - Stoutland - A bit boring but a key to a good side

Fleck - Rotom - I still don't know what it does, but it's good at doing it.

Stevens - Breloom - Looks shit on first glance. People in the know, know it's good.

Cantwell - Tsareena - Relatively new to the scene. Can be used to great effect in the right set up. Has potential for much more.

Duda - Stonjourner - I'd never heard of him until just now. I'd never seen Stonjourner until I got traded one. 

Bunedia - Milotic - Is an elegant baller, and looks fantastic. Unfortunately, stuck with shit.

Pukki - Wurmple - Got a party last year and was met with great happiness by the fans. No one cares now.


**Crystal Palace vs Watford**

**Crystal Palace**

Guaita - Graveler - Been around for ages. Good option to have, especially if you can't evolve it.

Ward - Metapod - Just exists to be hard to get past.

Dann -  Rattata - Been around for ages. Very boring. Some people think he's top percentage

Cahill - Raticate - Been around for ages. Very boring. Actually has success.

Van Aanholt - Croconaw - Stopped in the middle of his progression. Could have been more. I still really like him.

Kouyate - Piloswine - Been around for ages. I always thought it was better than it actually was. Needs more to be top tier.

McCarthy - Plusle - I thought this was McArthur

McArthur - Minun - I thought this was McCarthy

Ayew - Gastrodon - Easy to forget it exists. In the right set up can cause havoc.

Benteke - Diglett - Was a Dugtrio, but lost 2 of it's heads. Is now shit.

Zaha - Wobbuffet - Get's hit a lot. It's believed the right leg is the actual Zaha and the rest of the body is a decoy.

Hughes - Haxorus -  I honestly don't know if he's good or not. Looks like he should be, but isn't? Then sometimes is. 

Pereyra - Togekiss - Looks fancy. Can provide all the set up in the world. No end product. 

Doucoure - Metagross - A fucking unit. Can do it all. Should be rated higher.

Sarr - Mewtwo - Only person powerful enough to beat Liverpool.

Deeney - Garbodor - Ugly. Used to be a bad person. People are starting to warm to it. Actually really good.

**Arsenal vs West Ham**

**Arsenal**

Leno - Machamp - One of the best around. Has 4 hands.

Sokratis - Houndour - A greek hell hound. Just not a great one. 

Mari - Patrat - I don't know who he is. Didn't know arsenal signed him. He can be a starting rodent because he's forgettable clearly. 

Saka - Bagon - Unreal potential, gonna be a banger when he's older.

Ceballos - Gorebyss - Elegant yet shit.

fmjpcm,Rondont,(OC) The best match I ever attended (Effort post) (Czech Third Division),"Is this scraping the barrel?

Do you care at this stage?

I know we're all very starved for football at the moment, so I hope this effort post can go some of the way to making you guys happy. It's a bit tough for a lot of people dealing with isolation, anxiety and boredom, and I really appreciate a lot of the content that's been on this sub recently, so I hope someone reads this and enjoys my contribution...

Here's the story of the best game I ever saw live, and a look into life in the Czech Third Division for all you hipsters out there. The only other reference to SK L√≠≈°e≈à I could find on this sub was a link to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijd87x4v87g), which I struggle to explain. What follows is a game of lowish quality with a great score and a beautiful free kick.

# 26 March 2018- SK L√≠≈°e≈à face of against relegation battling HFK Olomouc in the hopes of keeping their faint promotion dreams alive.

**Context and Pre-Match**

In 2018 I was looking for teaching gigs in the Czech Republic, and briefly ended up in the small village of L√≠≈°e≈à, population 26,000.

Keen to check out a local match, I headed to [Stadion SK L√≠≈°e≈à](https://imgur.com/a/HZW1mNO) for SKL's game against HFK Olomouc. Shoutout to the [Futbology app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kepermat.groundhopper) for helping me track down details.

I was charmed by the fact that the [programme doubled as a ticket](https://imgur.com/a/dxA9cnN), and cost me a healthy 40 Kc (¬£1.30). The litre of beer I got with it was most likely cheaper, with a [scarf](https://scontent-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s960x960/37659033_2141858522738860_3206526663688978432_o.jpg?_nc_cat=104&amp;_nc_sid=e007fa&amp;_nc_ohc=um0b_hzBVzcAX8qQsIH&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-dub4-1.xx&amp;_nc_tp=7&amp;oh=176035622439bbdbd7bdf21dd141f3a3&amp;oe=5E9C14B9) costing roughly a fiver. The club shop was a small shed of about a metre square (it's where the E is painted [here](https://imgur.com/a/8APUUgU)), though the ground itself was fairly large.

SKL were in third place, and pushing for promotion, whilst HFK were stranded some way in the relegation zone, 15th place in a league of 16 and 13 points from safety

**The Game**

After 2 minutes, SKL had already found themselves behind, conceding what I remember to be a comical goal where a long ball was not properly dealt with. The SKL CB jumped at the ball, completely misjudging its trajectory and allowing HFK forward Patrik Volesky to nip in and slot past the keeper. 1-0 to HFK.

Things got worse when L√≠≈°e≈à keeper Jan Kotnour conceded a foul in the box, getting booked in the process, allowing Horka to double Oloumoc's lead just 20 minutes in. The standard of football was decidedly low thus far, with teams unable/unwilling to pass along the ground for more than a few seconds. One of the L√≠≈°e≈à wingers caught my eye a couple of moments with some silky running, but it rarely came to anything.

The one-time Olympian (iirc) L√≠≈°e≈à manager responded by instantly making a sub, which seemed to reinvigorate the team. A five-minute spell saw Lisen grab two goals and go in 2-2 at half-time. I grabbed a Smazeny Syr (Czech deep-fried cheese, you have to try it).

The second half was less eventful until 70 minutes in when cultured SKL defender Tadeus Zezula curled a beautiful free kick over the wall and past the HFK keeper. This far and away the most technically impressive moment I witnessed that day, and it was worth the (incredibly low) price of admission. The crowd went wild, and HFK lost their heads. Midfielder Marek Sichor received a second yellow and HFK had to fight their way back into the game. They didn't.

What remained was a crazed mess of misplaced passes, rash challenges and dodgy defending. It was beautiful- anything could have happened! But instead nothing happened and there were no further goals. SKL emerged victorious after seeing out the final minutes, and in a touch of pure class the squad walked to the main stand, shaking the hands of the congregated fans. I felt like something of a fraud, but got my handshakes nevertheless.

[Cheers to both teams for putting on such a great show](https://imgur.com/zmkUAhI)! It was one of the highlights of my time in the Czech Republic.

I really hope you guys found this interesting, I love insights into how football in other countries works and it was nice to relive the time I spent abroad. Look after each other at a time like this

**Postscripts**

* SKL did not achieve promotion in that season, but were promoted in the 2018-19 season by finishing first. They are currently safe, sitting 9th in the Czech second division prior to its suspension due to the virus.
* HFK were sadly relegated at the end of the season, and have since plied their trade in Czech Division E, where they were 2 points of the promotion place prior to their league's recent suspension. Hopefully things get resolved quickly and they are able to achieve promotion.
* Whilst wearing the scarf in Belfast, my friend asked me why I was wearing a Rangers scarf. I quickly removed it to avoid getting kneecapped, having worn it about town for the past week.
* Marek Sichor, sent off in this game, had an 11 game winless run in 2019 whilst playing for Valasske Mezirici.
* L√≠≈°e≈à is actually a district of Brno, but calling it a 'small village' seemed more romantic, and I thought it was a village until I was researching for this post.
* This is constructed from my memories from two years ago, I apologise for any factual inaccuracies, I was unable to find highlights online.
* Here is a display commemorating one of [SKL's most historic results](https://imgur.com/a/3jU4LUh).
* A [picturesque church](https://imgur.com/3Vp1bd9) in the distance.

fmj7mn,Loeffellux,Highlights of All Current Borussia Dortmund Players,"So I thought it would be a good use of my (now very plentiful) free time to gather different highlight videos and clips from youtube and reddit of all players in the current Borussia Dortmund current squad. 

[I originally posted this](https://old.reddit.com/r/borussiadortmund/comments/fmiyd2/ultimate_quarantine_highlight_collection/) to the /r/borussiadortmund subreddit (with a slightly longer disclaimer) but I thought it might be interesting regardless of which team you support 

I spent much more time on finding and selecting the individual clips than I did with the general highlight videos so I can't guarantee for their quality (or taste in music...). So if anything, I'd recommend checking those out.

fmig58,Whykecoakfly,Which Premier League Club's shirt sponsors have the best and worst league performance? An analysis.,"We are here to ask a simple question: which companies and industries dominate the Premier League, which one screwed the pooch.

So I pulled the league table from the beloved Wikipedia from 92/93 season up to 18/19 season. Then I get the shirts sponsors for each Premier League club from each year from [here](https://www.myfootballfacts.com/premier-league/all-time-premier-league/premier_league_shirt_sponsors/).

I then find the total points accumulated by each sponsor. Since some sponsors have significantly more games played than others, it's only fair to calculate the points per appearance too. One appearance means one season and one team. So if a sponsor appears in two clubs' shirts in the same season, it would be counted as two appearances.

Some companies have the same parent companies (for example Fly Emirates &amp; Emirates) which I just count them as the same company. I then categorize all the companies to a specific industry. My industry categories might not 100% accurate and it's based on my own decision.

Some teams in the past have different home and away sponsors, but for simplicity, I only count the home sponsors. There is only one company that I have no idea what they are: CFS from QPR's sponsor in 93/94. Hopefully, someone can help me with that one.

Without further ado. Here we go:

HIGHEST POINT SPONSORS

1. Emirates: 1247 pts; 17 apps
2. Carlsberg:  1161 pts; 17 apps
3. Etihad: 812 pts; 10 apps
4. Samsung: 807 pts; 10 apps
5. Chang: 797 pts; 14 apps

HIGHEST POINT/APPS SPONSORS

1. AIG: 87.75 pts/apps
2. Sharp: 83.5 pts/apps
3. Etihad: 81.2 pts/apps
4. Samsung: 80.7 pts/apps
5. Aon: 80.5 pts/apps

Note:

* Unsurprisingly, more appearances = more points (big brain analysis right here). Emirates takes the top spots by sponsoring Chelsea for 4 years and Arsenal for 13 years. However, they only won the league once with Chelsea 04/05 and has relatively low Pts/apps with only 73.35 pts/apps (thanks to Arsenal).
* Chang has the third-highest apps but can only accumulate 797 pts losing to Samsung and Etihad which only has 10 apps each. This is because it has an abysmal 56.93 pts/apps with Everton. :(
* 3 of Manchester United's sponsor is in the top 5 Pts/apps showing how dominant MU was in the Premier League. Another MU sponsor is Vodafone at 7th spot with 79.17 pts/apps. So all companies must be salivating to sponsor MU right? Well, Chervolet must be writing angry emails every year asking for a discount since Chervolet has only 70.4 pts/apps.
* The worst performing sponsor is Derbyshire Building Soc sponsoring the infamous Derby County 07/08 with only 11 pts and 1 apps. You could say that this is the second worst disaster in the financial industry in 2008.

Let's move on to industry category

HIGHEST POINT INDUSTRY

1. Electronics: 4953 pts; 87 apps
2. Beverage: 3644 pts; 60 apps
3. Gambling: 3235 pts; 75 apps
4. Finance: 2330 pts; 61 apps
5. Airline: 2622 pts; 40 apps

HIGHEST POINT/APPS INDUSTRY

1. Airline: 65.55 pts/apps
2. Insurance: 63.95 pts/apps
3. Beverage: 60.73 pts/apps
4. Telecommunications: 59.8 pts/apps
5. Gaming: 59.6 pts/apps

Note:

* The electronics industry takes the top spot because it's a pretty broad industry. The beverage industry is 2nd thanks to the Merseyside clubs with Carlsberg and Chang. The scousers really do love their beer. The next spot goes to the controversial gambling industry. Then finance and finally the airline industry.
* For pts/apps, The airline industry gets top spot probably because players can travel more comfortably and get discounts for their vacation which could increase morale. Insurance gives players a sense of security to break a leg. Beverage obviously because players can drink before and after the match to boost motivation. Telecommunication because players can communicate better in and off the ground. Gaming obviously because of epic gaming moment^(tm) .
* Interestingly, gambling average only around 43.13 pts/apps which is one of the worst performing industries. Probably because smaller teams are more likely to accept sponsors from the gambling industry. But we all know because players gamble more and stress and debt cause poorer performances.

FIRST PLACE SPONSORS

1. Sharp: 6 times
2. Etihad: 4 times
3. Samsung, AIG: 3 times
4. Vodafone, Aon: 2 times
5. Dreamcast, O2, Emirates, King Power, McEwan's Lager, JVC: 1 time

FIRST PLACE INDUSTRY

1. Electronics: 10 times
2. Airline, Insurance: 5 times
3. Telecommunication: 3 times
4. Gaming, Retail, Automotive, Beverage: 1 time

Note:

* The 90's is dominated by the electronics industry, the 00's by the insurance industry and the 10's by the airline industry.

Conclusion:

Seems like every decade a new industry will dominate the Premier League. Because of the Covid 19 which decimates the airline industry, expect a new industry to take over the league. Also, whenever possible try not to get sponsors from the gambling industry because it's a sure sign your clubs are going downhill. For a safe bet, get electronics, insurance or beverage sponsors which are high performing throughout the years.

fmgcx0,detstor,[OC] A comprehensive guide of the peculiar items thrown onto Turkish pitches,"After I read /u/Billion34 's [Greek way of thrown items](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fly1zw/oc_a_comprehensive_guide_of_the_peculiar_items/), I decided put my two cents about the Turkish way of foreign objects -which we call yabanci madde- 

Just as my dear neighbour Billion34 I'm not going to include flares, crackers, confettis etc. because they are too common for this kind of research.

Well as some of you know about the Istanbul trio and Trabzonspor but in Turkey there are other heated rivalries such as Bursaspor-Besiktas, Kocaelispor-Sakaryaspor, Ankaragucu-Besiktas, Goztepe-Karsiyaka, Adanaspor-Adana Demirspor etc. these matches are usually the most heated ones in any kind of competition. But I'm not going to below then 1st league games so you'll mostly see incidents from Galatasaray-Fenerbahce or Fenerbahce-Trabzonspor matches usually.

* **Rocks or Bricks**

Rocks are interesting materials, but how the hell fans find those rocks to throw? That is a good question and let me tell you how; usually fans bring some of them in their pockets but sometimes they tear or crumble down some parts of the stands to make some rocks to throw. One of the biggest ""rock"" incident was the [infamous Diyarbakirspor Bursaspor match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlFmJ79pyjc) that postponed in 6 March 2010 after Diyarbakirspor fans throw rocks, keychains, lighters at Bursaspor players and referees. Later federation awarded this match as 0-3 to Bursaspor. In that season Bursaspor got its first championship.

Another incident from a Turkish cup game between Tuzlaspor and Fenerbahce, that Tuzlaspor fans threw [rocks](https://img.sondakika.com/haber/001/tuzlaspor-fenerbahce-macinda-sahaya-tas-attilar-7974001_4_m.jpg)

There was another incident that [Trabzonspor fans threw some bricks](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf521c667b0a80f5024a49d) to Fenerbahce goalkeeper.

* **Water bottles**

Water is a way of life, water is a substance that makes us and football pitch is no different in this matter, grass likes water. Water bottles was always be a part of fan culture and one of the prime ""foreign objects"" that thrown to the pitch. One of the famous water bottle incident was the [19 May 2007 Galatasaray Fenerbahce match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZb8uEfOMH4) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUP42s6xugg) [3](https://facebook.com/12NumaraninSesi/videos/792606107508312/) a.k.a. ""Water Derby"" prior to this match Fenerbahce was already clinched the title and sports clique was talking about will Galatasaray team clap and congratulate Fenerbahce before the ceremony as you can see they even throw something at them. After the match which Fenerbahce won 2-1, [Galatasaray players guarded the midfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SNg2FC6AwQ) against a possibility of a [Souness's infamouos flag incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39UmmzqLOvs).

Well I can show some more clips about water bottles but pretty much you'll see these in every Turkish match. [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v_T6rezcDA), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM37WQGqXr8), 

* **Raki**

Another interesting object that thrown was raki bottle, I know It may sound strange why would someone throw something that so precious to someone we still don't know why but this incident happened at [Galatasaray Fenerbahce match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRLOIDOfJPY) that even Diego Lugano surprised to see. In another incident that again happened in Galatasaray's stadium between Galatasaray and Eskisehirspor someone threw a raki bottle but it landed around the crowd and injured a kid.

There are other incidents as well happened in Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game [2](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf523df67b0a80f5024a4c4)

* **Whiskey**

Besides raki there was also a whiskey incident that happened, this incident was in a Fenerbahce Galatasaray match, oh I know this sounds surprising after the raki incident but; in 12 May 2013 when Fenerbahce beat Galatasaray 2-1 in Kadikoy [their fans throw a whiskey bottle](https://kralspor.ensonhaber.com/resimler/viski.jpg) on to pitch.

* **Ayran and other beverage cans**

Well after raki and whiskey here it come the ayran; and to be fair ayran orther kind of beverage cans or bottles are not unusual objects to be thrown on pitch because they are convenient rather than a giant ass raki bottle; here you can see [Emre Belozoglu with a nice ayran can that he couldn't ran away](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CbMgKYiUAAAs1xy?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)

* **Cell phone**

No I'm not joking, that is a real foreign object that thrown to pitch and it's not a latest fashion. First documented incident was in 22 September 2001 in a Galatasaray Fenerbahce match that Galatasaray won 2-0 in Ali Sami Yen. [Galatasaray fans threw at least couple cell phones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNfHLlJUHyU?t=87) on to pitch, later fans got creative and started to use mockup cell phones with cements placed in them instead of batteries etc.

Here are some other documented incidents about this. [2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXNdZJOXcAADEeU?format=jpg&amp;name=small) [3](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf5223d67b0a80f5024a4aa)

* **Stove lid**

That's not a joke either, in [3 March 2009 Ankaraspor Besiktas game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLyfenFdelE) there was an incident that hit Rodrigo Tello, the object that hit him was a stove lid. Though I need to tell this about more because Ankaraspor had no fans but Ankaragucu fans attended these matches when Ankaraspor played against Besiktas or other Istanbul teams and due to their fan rivalry and clashes against Besiktas fans that incident was Ankaragucu fans initiation. [2](https://kralspor.ensonhaber.com/resimler/galeri/sahaya_atilan_yabanci_maddeler_1.jpg) [3](https://twitter.com/Hasan83285616/status/1064882877152849920] [4](https://twitter.com/Hasan83285616/status/1064900335196667905)

* **Giant metal pole**

In 10 March 2014 Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game something interesting happened; [Trabzonspor fans dismantled a giant ass metal pole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR4rtJmjkcg) that was behind the Fenerbahce goal and threw it. [2](https://assets.dogannet.tv/img/82/640x0/5b0e8a36ae298b43cd1d4d82) [3](https://img.fanatik.com.tr/img/78/740x418/5b0e8a3566a97c4350d60da8.jpg) [4](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf5230067b0a80f5024a4b1)

That game was crazy you can see more things thrown at pitch in [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9fE8MN8l28).

* **Knife**

Well since we are in the metal zone here comes another metal object which is knife; oh I know you are thinking WTH but hear me out. In several there are knifes thrown at pitch, so let's start. In 1 April 2012 Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game [Trabzonspor fans threw a knife](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf521c667b0a80f5024a49f) on to pitch later Fenerbahce goalkeeper gave it to referee.

There are other incidents as well, in 2017 Super Cup game between Besiktas and Konyaspor [fans threw a knife](https://s1.dmcdn.net/v/LF4xc1PXtwTUaMME_/x1080) on to pitch later [Quaresma gave it to referee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv4EciozLEI). Also there are other incidents as well; [2](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf522b567b0a80f5024a4ad), [3](https://twitter.com/Nocontext_61/status/1236404343332626433)

* **Viking Axe**

You must be asking yourself is he trolling us, no I certainly am not and I'll be adding some more objects to the lot. In 23 November 2001 Goztepe Fenerbahce game in Izmir, Goztepe fans threw a viking axe on to pitch. We had the photo proof of this incident but I couldn't find it.

* **Door knob**

In another Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game [Trabzonspor fans threw a door knob](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf5238967b0a80f5024a4bd) to Fenerbahce goalkeeper.

* **Ashtray**

In the same game [Trabzonspor fans also threw an ashtray](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf5232b67b0a80f5024a4b7) to Fenerbahce goalkeeper.

* **Lighters**

As usual lighters and keychains thrown at pitch usually. [These](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf523b567b0a80f5024a4c2) are from Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game that in the past.

* **Shoes**

In 24 April 2016 Trabzonspor Fenerbahce game after Fenerbahce's first goal [Trabzonspor fans threw a shoe](https://i4.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/0x0/5bf5252967b0a80f5024a4d4) at Fenerbahce goalkeeper.

* **Rabbit**

Yes, we also have a rabbit that found itself on to pitch. In 19 December 2010 Akhisar Tavsanli Linyitspor game -BTW Tavsan means rabbit in Turkish so Tavsanli means place that has rabbits- one [Akhisar fan was holding a rabbit](https://qol.az/img/pics/large/5302.jpg) then that rabbit was fell on to the pitch. [1](https://imgrosetta.mynet.com.tr/file/1648080/728xauto.jpg) [2](https://foto.sondakika.com/haber/2011/02/03/akhisar-staddaki-tavsan-dogurdu_o.jpg)

Well I can go on but I think this is enough also there are other objects that also thrown on to pitch such as hammer, people etc.",29,1584803322,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fmgcx0/oc_a_comprehensive_guide_of_the_peculiar_items/,soccer,1

While I have a good idea about the major rivalries in the modern balkan nations like Red Star v Partizan and Hajduk v Dinamo Zagreb, I am wondering what cross-country matches caught the most attention in the old Yugoslav first league?

Was there kind of a hierarchy of rivalries, like was Red Star and Dinamo a lot better than Hajduk vs Partizan, or were all the matches between the 4 most successful teams all equally intense and important? Were there any social or political implications to any matches in the Yugoslav first league aside from the known city derbies? Basically, I want to know about the rivalry dynamics of the yugoslav first league, of course anyone with a good answer will have their comment featured. Thanks for taking the time to read this guys.",1,1584799567,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/fmfgrk/soccer_fans_from_the_balkans_i_have_a_questions/,soccer,1

fmfaft,john_runnner,Coentrao's 72 hours before Madrid - Atleti,"SUNDAY, three days before the match. Fabio Coentrao is wearing a wife beater in his living room, stretched out on his sofa watching reruns of The Simpsons while he rolls a  cigarette. His phone rings. He puts the cigarette behind his ear and reluctantly answers.

**Coentrao:** [hoarse cough] Hello?

**Ancelotti:** Fabio? How are you? It's me, the coach. I think we need you next week. Marcelo is suspended.

**Coentrao:** [Covers the mouthpiece with his hand and whispers profanities in Portuguese. He takes a deep breath. He looks at his schedule on his phone and gets back on the phone, a little more calm than he was.] When do you need me? I can't on Thursday. I'm playing poker with the boys.

**Ancelotti:** No, there's no CL on Thursdays. Wednesday. Against Atleti.

**Coentrao:** In Bilbao? (Where Athletic plays)

**Ancelotti:** No, Fabio. Against the ones we played last year in Lisbon.

**Coentrao:** [He writes down the time and date on an empty pizza box] Ok, coach. I'll be there on Wednesday. My license is still suspended so call me a cab. Do I need to go to the training grounds?

**Ancelotti:** Uhh... I don't think so. Just be there on Wednesday a few minutes before kick-off. I'm counting on you. By the way, Benzema isn't playing either. Chicharito will play in his place.

**Coentrao:** Who?

**Ancelotti:** Chicharito. The Mexican who came this summer, the one who's been wearing a beanie in training since October. Forget about it. I'll introduce him to you on Wednesday. Don't forget to wear a white shirt.

**Coentrao:** Understood, boss.

Coentrao hangs up and takes a deep breath. He tries to get rid of the cloud of smoke in the room. He tries to find his boots among the mountains of clothes, dolls made of beer cans and takeout Chinese food. He doesn't remember where he put them last. He doesn't even remember when he played his last game. He smells his white shirt. Ugh.

MONDAY, two days before the match. The phone rings again. It's 12:36 in the afternoon. Fabio's hand emerges from the duvet feeling for the phone on the nightstand. Who the hell is calling at this ungodly hour? It must be an emergency.

**Ronaldo:** Fabio, it's Cris. How are you, man? Did I wake you?

**Coentrao:** [Sounding asleep but trying to appear awake] Hey, Cris. No, don't worry. I was just doing some push ups.

**Ronaldo:** Listen, we need you on top of things on Wednesday. I'm sure the coach let you know. Just like old times.

**Coentrao:** Yes, of course! You can count on it. He also told me some Colombian is playing. Some guy by the name of Chapul√≠n.

[Uncomfortable silence]

**Ronaldo:** Uh... Yeah, sure. Get in shape, man. We're all counting on you.

**Coentrao:** Relax, homie.

TUESDAY on the eve of the match. Fabio goes for a run in the park in front of his house. He's wearing some worn New Balance shoes he used to play tennis in in the year 1998 and a shirt that says ""What happens in Cascais stays in Cascais"". After stretching, he runs around for 10 minutes and starts coughing. That's enough for today, he thinks while he takes his pulse. It could be counterproductive to give my body this kind of shock so close to the match. Unprofessional, even.

He turns his TV on and Bar√ßa is playing against PSG. Fabio is confused: Didn't these guys already play last year? He laughs every time the cameraman does a closeup of David Luiz's hair.

*WEDNESDAY.* Match day. He arrives in the stadium by taxi. He doesn't really remember how to get to the dressing room. A very nice man by the name of Chendo shows him to his locker and he gets dressed. He feels the tension in the dressing room. Sergio Ramos will play as CM. This sounds odd to Fabio, but Fabio never asks questions. He follows orders. There's a guy next to him wearing the number 14 who gets to his knees and starts to pray. Xabi Alonso looks very strange. Must have shaved.

He walks onto the pitch and when the Champions League anthem plays he transforms himself. He jumps, tackles and fights for every single ball. He gives his all. He pushes up the wing, makes crosses and marks his man. He looks spectacular out there. In the 87th minute, the guy who was on his knees praying scores. He looks touched. The crowd chants a strange name. ""Damn, Spanish is hard"", thinks Fabio as he flies through the air fighting Ra√∫l Garc√≠a for the ball.

He's taken off in the 90th minute and the spectators acknowledge his hard work.

He takes a shower and Ancelotti congratulates him.

**Ancelotti:** Incredible game, Fabio.

**Coentrao:** Thanks, boss. It was nothing. I'm here for whatever you need. Call me for the return leg.

Ancelotti is bewildered but doesn't say anything. Coentrao leaves the Bernab√©u without saying goodbye to anyone and without talking to the press. He lights a Lucky Strike and tries to hail a cab on the Castellana.

Ancelotti shakes his head and smiles as he watches Fabio walk away. He tears open a pack of gum, raises his eyebrow and throws eight pieces of gum in his mouth as he mutters ""there's a method to his insanity"".

""I was rooming with Robbie Fowler. We'd come back from our evening‚Äîslightly later than the curfew, shall we say. And Rafa was patrolling rooms, making sure everyone was in their rooms and stuff like that.

""So we were both *in*, so we were fine... got a knock at the door, and I opened it and it was Rafa in his pajamas... traditional sorta checked, done up to the top *pajamas*. He looked very smart. I thought 'We're fine here.' Y'know? We're in our room. So I opened it. 'Gaffer, you okay?' He said 'Where's Robbie?' I said 'He's in here as well.' Rafa sorta brushes past me to check, and as he came in Robbie was nowhere to be seen. I was like, 'Wha... I swear to you, he was here! I dont know where he's gone...' 

""And for some reason, Robbie had got in... you know the cupboards, in like the roof? So he's in the smallest little gap up above, right? So I'm looking at Rafa's eyeline, right, and above him is Robbie Fowler in this cupboard with his finger going [shush]. And I swear to you I'm in tears here. I'm trying my best not to laugh. I saw a bit of movement and was like 'Oh my god he's in the cupboard.' But I had to like keep my... like I couldn't say 'Oh yeah he's in the cupboard right there, gaffer.'

fmbsis,sportsticketexchange,Champions League: Callum Lang desperate to show his value to Shrewsbury Town,"Striker Callum Lang is desperate to make up for the lost time and prove his ability to Shrewsbury Town fans after a nightmare injury spell. The on-loan Wigan hotshot broke his metatarsal at Tran mere in October and was out for three months. Champions League fans can book [**CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TICKETS**](https://www.sportticketexchange.com/champions-league-tickets/) on our website on exclusively discounted prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Lang, 21, admitted the first major injury of his young career was a big setback on what he hoped would prove a prolific loan stint at Sam Ricketts‚Äô Shrewsbury. 

‚ÄúAt first I took it well but when you have to watch from the sidelines it‚Äôs hard. I came on a loan because I wanted to play every week. The last time I didn‚Äôt play every weekend I must have been...God knows how old.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy mum and my whole family have been fed up with me the last few months, now I can try to be positive and keep picking up my performances and hopefully show everyone here what I can do. I haven‚Äôt been able to do that as much so I just want to have a really positive end of the season. I‚Äôm looking forward to how it will end.‚Äù

Lang signed a new three-year deal at his parent Latics before joining Town on loan. He previously enjoyed goal-laden loans at Morecambe and Oldham in League Two.

**Callum Lang Talk**

‚ÄúOn a personal level my performances are getting back to how they should be and how they used to be,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI came here and was buzzing. I loved my first few games and got off to a good start and was looking forward to the season. ‚ÄúI got that injury against Tranmere and was gutted about it. I wanted to stay around the lads every day. The fans were so positive with me, I had a lot of messages won Twitter and Instagram when I was injured and it helped me out a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to be back earlier than I was and it was frustrating when you get back on the pitch, you‚Äôre not your usual self after being out four months.‚Äù
