CORRECTIVE ENVICERATION. 

Ch 1. 

The alarm went off. ""I want to be a boss, to be a boss,"" the alarm sang to him. It was 6:30 A.M., in the late 2020s or early 2030s. 

""I want to be social worker, to be a social worker."" He got up from his bed and did his morning routine. He went to work in the autobus. In his office, he alone told his secretary that he was no longer attracted to his wife. He continued that ""sweet women are no longer my thing, now I'm hot for total badasses with deep voices."" 

His secretary apologized that she asked. 

""Forgiven, no one comes around for seconds of that, it's so filling. Now, return to your cube."" She did so, and he went out into the windowed cell in the reception area. There, he asked an indigent woman that was confronting and reprimanding him whether he needed to call the police. 

She said that that was not necessary, that she was leaving immediately. She did so, and took her stuff with her. A fellow client saw this, and got out to her. There, she had spilled the stuff and was struggling to pick it back up. The fellow client offered to pick it up, and she told him to take off. He returned into the reception area, and the social worker was making a phone call on a landline. 

The client shouted, ""That was a really stupid thing that you did! Next time, be silent when you're confronted!"" He shouted so loud that people down the corridor heard him. 

""What?"" 

The client shouted, ""That was a really stupid thing that you did! Next time, be silent when you're confronted!"" 

""I've already called the police, if you want to go with them, you can stay."" The client left, and the social worker went back into his office, and the password prompt soon gave way to cetacean related desktop background pursuant to his office's cetacean theme. He did some he did some work on interagency sharing of information with the police erroneously, and once he got on his game, he did civilian work. He needed to do some overtime to do the civilian work correctly, and he went home on time. There, his wife sat on his face, and he wasn't able to get hard. His wife made an ultimatum - that he will do the dishes or she will spank him. He still wasn't that hard, but he was hard enough. They had coitus and he went to sleep. He faced away from her, and she embraced him with one of her arms and one of her legs. Then, she went to sleep as well. In the morning, she went over to the cabinet she visits before and after Visiting the writing table, except she didn't visit the writing table this time. She visited the library instead. There, she spent time standing before a self-contained scanning and reading appliance. 

Ch 2. 

""So, Willow, are you proficient with Python?"" 

She nodded, and when asked, she said that she was reckless, she'll take the risk that she'll get bit by the venomous snake. 

Her interviewer was taken back for a moment. ""Oh, well, I've never heard Python be described as a venomous snake before. I don't know about the other firms, but we communicate more literally here."" 

""I'M PROFICIENT WITH PYTHON BECAUSE I LOVE ANIMALS."" 

""Ma'am, that does not follow."" 

""THE PYTHON IS AN ANIMAL."" 

The interviewer gasped, bit his lower lip, and looked down. ""Oh my God,"" he whispered. He facepalmed, and said, ""No further questions. I have your number, and if I'm interested, I'll call in five working days. If you don't get a response from me by then, I would encourage you to pursue other opportunities."" 

""OKAY, HAVE A NICE DAY,"" she said, and got up and left. 

She went to grant an interview to another prospect at another firm. 

""So, Willow, are you proficient with Python?"" 

She nodded, and when asked, she said that she is excited for the job position. Her emotions were the only thing whatsoever on which she had spoken her mind or told the truth. She got the job. All told, the prospect interviewed her only twice, and the previous interview was three months before. She and her interviewer walked into the office, and bragged about her TTF. According to the email print outs and secret journals, Willow was assigned to the team assigned to ""Python the bank to the planes."" What that means, no one there, no court, and not even I know exactly, but the court later concluded that it meant to use Causal ML for some aerospace application. They were trying to create a computer program motivated in part by money. It would quantify how much a decision, no matter how small or how large, would cause utility to be gained, and this was turned into a financial instrument. Algorithms in New York, NY would then speculate on the financial instrument, and algorithms where the decision is implemented would then make the decision by interpreting the price. 

One of Willow's workmates coughed, and failed to cover it. 

""COVER YOUR COUGH."" 

Once again, he coughed and failed to cover his cough. 

""CALL IN SICK."" 

""If I don't have a near perfect attendance record, then I'll be fired."" 

""YOU BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM OR I'LL RUN YOU OUT OF HERE, YOU BETTER TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THAT,"" she said softly, smiling. 

""You're smiling, I see. In any case, your argument is persuasive,"" he said, and then he put on one of the many masks the workplace provided. She stole a keystroke logger from the IT department by bumping the lock on the drawer where the keystroke logger was kept. He then later unintentionally infected her with low-virulence rhinovirus over fomites when she sat at his computer when he wasn't there, she quickly popped the keystroke logger in, and left. She was no work martyr, so she stayed home. 

When the airline perished under corruption, its email printouts and journal entries convinced the court that the non-monetary motivation part of the program was not done properly. 

That she wasn't there when someone at the workplace hashtagged out the proper line and wrote a similar line under it, containing a call to a method defined with a line beginning with def and nothing was indented underneath it, but is similarly named to the method that would have added non-monetary motivation to the program's utility had the definition of non-monetary motivation been implemented properly was a key factor in the court case to come. This, the adequacy of assistance of counsel of her public defender, her wish to speak with her attorney first in the police interview, that she was not tried in Redwood City, CA, and sheer dumb luck were crucial in the not guilty verdict for the charge of criminal negligence. Assistance of counsel was adequate for the simple facts that her lawyer was not a toxic employee, and cases in which the court committed legal errors were not this one. The court cited none of these factors in their decision. Her lawyer was the child of non abusive parents who got gently divorced soon enough, became a non toxic employee by just staying away from people they didn't trust in school, not casually sharing beds, not meeting with bartenders nor drug dealers, not going into the alcohol section of the grocery store, by studying hard, and passing the bar. Their boss's unqualification was not woeful. Someone could have accurately predicted the result in voir dire. 

The People were using an algorithm for attributing the bug that unbeknownst to the court attributed it to just anyone that was there that day. Confidence was only about 70% on the classification of the person that it had classified as responsible for the bug. However, had the other key factors been absent, Willow would have been convicted. 

And she never heard back from the first prospect. 


Ch. 3 

The social worker went off to another enterprise that worked with the homeless, which specializes in treating people that say that they've been abused. The clients took a vote, and voted for someone to show up and give a presentation from a misanthropic view. The most obscure line in the entire presentation was that in all the over 20 studied cases of rape and rape accusations, substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present, so you can protect yourself against rape by - 

""You're fired. We don't say things like 'substance use or neuromodulation by the perpetrator or by the victim was present, so you can protect yourself against rape,'"" the social worker suddenly explained while pre-meeting with the presenter. 

""I can remove the line for the presentation, and then you can rehire me."" 

""Sir, I prefer to not hear it. You need to leave now."" 

Later, one of the clients asked, ""How are we supposed to protect ourselves? I already had the self defense course by the time it happened, and it didn't work. There's already sex offenders in prison, so they can't be deterred."" 

""This meeting is adjourned,"" the social worker suddenly said. 

""But sir, I can still take this question,"" the replacement presenter said. 

""But sir, this meeting is adjourned,"" the social worker said again. The clients groaned once they realized he was serious. 


Ch. 4 

Among the client population of a homeless shelter, a toad-shaped man quietly confronted one of his enemies. She apologized profusely, and said that she was sorry. 

""No, you're not."" 

His enemy left the homeless shelter, and his friend, Willow, showed up. 

""HI, HOW ARE YOU,"" she asked in her mezzo-soprano voice. 

He answered that he was fine, and he asked her, how is her work? 

""IT'S JUST FINE, TO BE HONEST,"" she said, and after he pressed the matter, she said, ""LOOK, I'LL GET OUT MY LAPTOP, MY CLIENT, CYBERDORNGORNG69 IS TWEETING HER F---BOY NOW THAT SHE WANTS MORE AND NOW SHE ASKED ME WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE FIRED BEFORE THEIR F---BOY ASKS THEM OUT ON A DATE, I HAD TO ERASE A SPREAD BECAUSE THERE'S THESE COURT CARDS IS ALL."" (https://purefieldhealing.com/tarot-mistakes-to-avoid-what-to-do-instead/) She showed him what she meant on her laptop, which had two walruses having sex as its desktop background. The other windows were open to r/rapekink and the Wikipedia page on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. 

""But didn't you learn how to read court cards after your client stopped having hate-ex-sex to go exclusive with their f***-boy preparing for commitment talk?"" (https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/advice/a6595/turn-your-friends-with-benefits-into-boyfriend/) 

""NO, THE REASON WHY I SAID NO LAST TIME IS THAT THE CLIENT NEVER DID THAT. HE IS STILL THE SOLE MEMBER OF HIS 'HASHTAG XTRUTH' PROJECT. THIS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE MY CLIENT AND HIM MET ON TWITTER COMING FORWARD AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE EXES."" (https://www.scarymommy.com/why-shouldnt-talk-trash-about-your-ex/) 

""I see, so your client is still talking about their ex, and they're still seeing them. How are your client's friends taking this?"" 

""HERE'S HOW THEY'RE TAKING THIS: THE ONE FRIEND THE F---BOY INTRODUCED HER TO ASKED WHAT IF THE F---BOY AND MY CLIENT WERE COMMITTED, AND THE F---BOY UP AND LEFT FOR HIS CLIO SEEKING WORK IMMEDIATELY. THEY WERE HAVING BREAKFAST TOGETHER."" 

""So, how can you get things together?"" 

""LEARNING INVERSIONS. IT'S ALL INVERSIONS THIS TIME."" 

""No, you can't, you're bad at inversions."" 

She faced her computer and raised her arms up into a W. ""LISTEN, YOU HAD BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM OR I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU. NOW, IF SHE CAN JUST GET HIM DRUNK ENOUGH TO SAY YES, AND PUT IT ON HER PHONE WITH THE CAMERA APP, WHEN HE'S SOBER SHE CAN CONFRONT HIM WITH THAT.""


Ch. 5 

""You need to organize the Christmas party, with alcohol,"" the social worker said in East Palo Alto. 

The organizer objected that alcohol is bad. 

""What does my man Miguel have to say about this,"" the social worker asked. 

""If you don't organize the Christmas party with alcohol, then you will organize it without alcohol, and then we'll stick alcohol in there on our own,"" Miguel told the organizer. 

""The reason why I am telling you to organize the Christmas party with alcohol is that you're going to organize the Christmas party. I'm telling someone to organize the Christmas party with alcohol because the bank and the clients drink alcohol at parties,"" the social worker explained. ""The bank will be there, they're funding the party and are the primary funding source for the shelter."" 

The organizer resigned, effective immediately. They left the building. 

""Miguel, you need to quickly hire a new organizer."" 

""On it, sir."" Miguel texted someone, and he said, ""That was Peter, he can have a new organizer in 36 hours."" 48 hours later, Peter texted Miguel, who texted his boss, the social worker. ""Nu oegernizer at epa,"" was the text from Peter that Miguel texted, and the social worker pre-met with the secretary and the bank. 

""Willow, is it? We need you to organise a party."" 

""OKAY. I MAY BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE YOUR PARTY."" 

""It involves alcohol."" 

""OF COURSE,"" Willow said, perking up. 

""It will be in Redwood City."" 

""OH, IT WILL BE IN REDWOOD CITY."" 

""Yeah, it'll be in Redwood City, and the bank will be there. It's easier to find a job when you have a job, and the organizer position is like a job with them. Maybe they'll promote you to proper employee for long-term employment."" 

""I NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT."" 

Ch. 6 

""Oh my God, sir. There's a veteran with a reinforced prosthetic body that's just exploded in the shelter across [Highway] 101. Staff have called police."" 

""What does he want?"" 

""To punch washing machines. He says the washing machines are hostile."" 

""What?"" 

""He says the washing machines, they look through the pockets for fights people misplace in the pockets."" 

""Does he have a chemical imbalance?"" 

""Yes, alcohol. He says that some slipped in through the food."" 

""Did that happen. Food doesn't carry enough alcohol for that to happen."" 

""There's a storm coming, I can feel it."" 

""Worse. And more fun. There's a Christmas party coming. So you need to ATL him."" 

""Sir, why?"" 

""I'm glad you asked. There will be alcohol at the party."" 

""But the organizer said that alcohol is bad."" 

""I replaced them."" 

""Four were ATL'ed last week, he will be the fourth this week."" 

""Do it."" 

""That's a decision shelter staff should make, but I'll recommend it it to them anyway."" 

""It's not a recommendation, it's an instruction. After he gets out of the 5150, he's still to leave to another shelter."" 

""I wish to remain silent."" 

Ch. 7 

Willow met her friend at the library, and there, she told him that she'd been assigned to organize a party in Redwood City with alcohol with the bank. 

""Oh my God, that's terrible. But at least there'll be alcohol."" 

""IT IS TERRIBLE, BECAUSE I'LL NEED YOUR HELP WITH ORGANIZING, BUT IT WILL BE AWESOME SINCE YOU'LL BE THERE I THINK. I NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT REDWOOD CITY. YOU SHOULD CALL UP YOUR CONTACTS."" 

""You wouldn't know this since you're a woman, but I've already been there. The place is a total sausage fest. The meal room is too small, so you'll need to meet outside. The front porch is also too small, so you need to meet out in the back. There's about 35 clients there, so you could be looking at maybe 50, 100 people to serve. You have to consider both shelter staff and bank staff. You'll need lots of both food and alcohol. Also, you need to supply lots of intravenous needles and sharps containers in the bathrooms."" 

""BUT WHY NEEDLES? WHY NOT LIGHTERS AND THIMBLES?"" 

""Well, first of all, you're thinking of freebasing. Second, you would use a spoon, not a thimble. Third, you need to provide lots of clean intravenous needles because my offense wasn't a sex offense, it was mainlining cocaine."" 

""THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YOU CAN'T USE ALL THOSE NEEDLES."" 

""Don't be disingenious, it was in Redwood City, and I won't be doing it, the guests will. In 13 months, I lost my job, my significant other, and my home, all to mainlining cocaine. I blew up at work every time something went wrong, and I used to blow up at my significant other. All that was in Redwood City. San Francisco is the drug capital of the Peninsula, but second to that, is Redwood City."" 

""DID YOU BLOW UP IN BED?"" 

""Yes, but not during sex."" 

""HOLY S---."" 

""I rest my case."" 

""I'M GOING TO THE CLINIC TO FIND THE NEEDLES. PLEASE COME WITH ME."" They went together to the clinic, who turned them down. The cited reason was that she's not an established event organizer. She visited the bank on the bus, and picked up the company card. With it, she paid for bus passes and rode the bus to Redwood City the next day. There, she visited the shelter. The social worker's story checked out, and she still meant to pick up needles and Sharps Containers. 

""Willow? I found one on the Internet."" (https://www.nasen.org/map/) Her friend wasn't kidding about it being the second most substance fuelled city on the peninsula. The clinic was well placed, because the city needed it. They did the errand, spent the night in EPA, and in the morning, they shopped for alcohol. They wound up ordering cheap red wine. 

Finding food other than tappa (https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/29181/is-there-an-english-word-meaning-snacks-eaten-as-an-accompaniment-while-drinkin) was more than difficult. r/migraine told them that the ideal food for this case was called Mud and Snow with Gronions, (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gronion) meaning black beans with green onions on white rice. They went out to the place, and ask the proprie - 

""Oh my God, Willow? Like what the f*** are you doing here?!"" 

""A SOCIAL WORKER MY CASE MANAGER KNOWS WANTS ME TO ORGANIZE A CHRISTMAS PARTY, AND -"" 

""What the f*** do you think you're doing here, and what's this about a social worker?!"" 

""WE LIVE IN A HOMELESS SHELTER, AND THE SOCIAL WORKER TOLD ME TO ORGANIZE A CHRISTMAS PARTY."" 

""Oh my God, that's it! Pedro, hon, call the cops. Pedro, come on, I'm telling you to call the f****** cops. This thief is here, and she lives in a homeless shelter for people that steal keyloggers from IT departments. We're outside, Willow. So don't tell me to cover my cough again."""" 

""WHAT THE F--- IS WRONG WITH YOU? WE ONLY CAME HERE TO GET MUD AND SNOW! CALM THE F--- DOWN!"" 

""F*** off. Don't tell me to calm down, you calm down. F*** off."" 

Her friend urged her to leave, and they did so. They spent the night in EPA, and the next morning, they had Mud and Snow with Grunions at a canteen in San Carlos. They stared out into space, and - 

""Willow, this is amazing. This is an aphrodisiac."" 

""NO, COME ON, IT'S NOT AN APHROSIDIAC. ONLY ADDYI IS THAT."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flibanserin) 

""No, this is an aphrodisiac. It's also nootropic. Because of it, I now know stuff."" 

""LIKE WHAT DO YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU HAD SOME?"" 

""For example, I now know that you need to get f---ed. I need to f---. We need to f--- each other. We must have sex."" 

""MAYBE NOT, I CAN HOLD IT IF I WANT."" 

""Will you? Now that you've eaten it too? F--- me. F*** you, except the opposite of f*** off, f*** on. Come over here and f***. I am always right, and I am never wrong. Your legs are made for being spread and lifted, and your c----- is made to accept hella tight rock hard d--- deep and fast in missionary position variations while your deep voice sexmoans."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary_position#Variations) 

""ASSHOLE, YOU'RE A WALRUS."" 

""That was a really dumba--ed thing you said."" The canteen operator asked them both to leave. They spent the night in EPA. 

Ch. 8 

Successfully ordering Mud and Snow with Grunions from that explosion hazard was the first thing that happened that morning. Then, he went over the guest list. The shelter staff, the caterer, the Christmas party organizers, and the shelter clients would all be there. There would also be the bank, who had just failed a training course on critical thinking and fraud examination. They failed because they were too gullible. One of the clients, Liam, (https://www.verywellfamily.com/top-1000-baby-boy-names-2757618) was convicted for a sex offense and was recently released from prison. Their file claims that they were sex offender, it's obvious from what the file says that they are untreated deaf and when they are drunken, they are also blind. They and a stranger met at a bar. The stranger was notorious for having drunken sex with strangers in bars. The two of them reconvened to the bathroom, and then of course later she pressed criminal charges. The police interviewed Liam using the Kinesic Method first for 9 contiguous hours at night, during which he wished to speak to his attorney first. The judge ruled the interrogation inadmissible, so the police interviewed him for twelve contiguous hours at night, using the PEACE Method. Frank wished to speak with his attorney first, and police used a suspicious signature on a Miranda rights waiver to continue. Frank finally ""told the truth"" in the 11th hour. The two confessions differ in many details, but both say that he knew he was raping her and he was sober at the time. The stranger was also notorious for paranoia and making mistakes, but never lying. All told, people capable of believing that Frank could be innocent would immediately view the case as what began as sex to which both willingly, equally and simultaneously drunk parties attempted to consent, and then she attempted to stop him. Due to his deafness and drunken blindness, he was unaware that she was attempting to stop him. Though she rarely if ever lies, she mistook the tragic encounter for rape. Then, he made internalized false confessions. All told, no one accomplished anything, since not only was this tragic accident mistaken for a felony, but since he himself mistook this for an intentional offense, so he failed to learn anything. His real offense was the simple fact he failed to stay clean and dry. 

Of course, many people are not capable of believing in such a scenario, have difficulty believing that an accident can be mistaken for a crime, and they have difficulty viewing doubt as reasonable. Defense attorneys in encounters with such people often complain that such people have difficulty understanding the defense case. When they consider someone to be guilty, there are rarely if ever clear signs that they are lying. Because his case was tried in Redwood City, 9 of the 12 of the people on the jury were of this type. Several candidates were disqualified from the jury, citing the rule that those with legal training are not allowed to serve on juries. One of the jurors was not of this type, but claiming to ""infer it because it is not logical,"" they voted for ""tellishment,"" (source: Wikipedia) as they put it in court, claiming that though the man is innocent, the jury needs to ingratiate themselves to the community's alleged ""wack values"" and to ""concur with it because it is erroneous"". The juror would often use the word ""expressly"" to describe their actions. The judge insisted that this was vote for a guilty verdict. The client served greater than 366 days contiguously in a prison for only sex offenders. The client was released from prison, spend time in a halfway house for recently released prisoners, and after an incident there with a fellow client, he began sleeping in the homeless shelter in East Palo Alto. There, a mysterious, venomous anthropod bit him. He then exploded while surrounded by shelter staff and he and several other clients began sleeping in the homeless shelter in Redwood City instead. 

""I think that the rapist has learned his lesson,"" the social worker suddenly said in the office in no particular direction. To his appalled secretary, he said, ""Liam, I mean, his time as a prisoner has reformed him. He's an ex-con that did over a year for raping a woman in Redwood City."" 

The secretary read the file, and she expressly concluded that he was innocent of that offense, and that his real offense was to drink. 

The social worker silently took an early lunch break. He returned, full of ham and cheese bagel and high as a flying kite on coffee. 

Ch 9. 

At trial, the videotape clearly showed Willow having drunken missionary position variation sex that both willingly, equally, and simultaneously drunken parties had attempted to consent with her friend in one of the bunks in the shelter in Redwood City during the Christmas party. Specifically, he lifted and spread her legs and unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate her, performed cunnilingus on her and then penetrated her vagina with his fully erect penis, at first slowly and then his penetrating her became deep and fast. She moaned, and lip reading reveals that she said ""OH MY F---ING GOD, IT'S HELLA TIGHT"". Afterwards, they kissed and slept there. It also clearly showed Liam drunkenly penetrating one of the drunken bank staff. The bank staff member later pressed criminal charges against Willow and her friend. Willow was sentenced to more than 366 days in prison. The public defender appealed the sentence as cruel and unusual, to no avail. The court had them both fitted with microchip implants. Willow's friend was sentenced to probation with an order to perform community service, the service of becoming by CRISPR a pinniped at sea - and Willow's prison as well, for at the behest of the court, the prison clamped his tubes, created a woman having missionary position variation sex shaped body cavity inside his abdomen, relocated his penis so that it could deeply penetrate Willow's vagina, fitted Willow with an apparatus for breathing, eating, drinking water, and excreting, and sedated and incarcerated Willow in there. Microchip implants confirmed who was incarcerated inside whom. The way she was tied up in there, she could bend her arms up into a W or down to her hips, and to otherwise flex her body, but not to hit her friend, nor could either of them masturbate. Also, they connected her BCI to a BCI port inside of his body cavity, ultimately connected to his brain. By design, her prison uniform dissolved in the saline there, and the sedative soon wore off. Then, they put the two of them out to sea with the other hapless people also sentenced to corrective envisceration. The bank staff member was later fired in an avalanche of copies of journals that workmates came forward with, calling her a narcissistic, impossible-to-believe liar in other matters occurring both before and after the alleged rape (https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/types-of-liars/#gref). However, her falsehoods were unintentional, for she had simply overestimated her skills in the interview and on her resume, and persuaded an employer that gave her no entrance exam. This was one of her habits, and it was a key part of her personality. 

The social worker and her long-time, non-toxic significant other had just had human sexual activity, and were outside in the park. Though to speak in fractions of a second, they were the first to begin dying when the Israeli SLBM warhead struck the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula, their death was the quickest and easiest. They were vaporized without having even noticed it. 

The others were less fortunate, for they were crushed under falling building debris or died within 24 painful hours of various precipitating causes for the simple fact that they were there. The President of the United States survived the nuclear strikes by Israel against the United States. A submarine that the United States ran did the same thing to Jerusalem with Trident D5LEP (lit. ""model of three-pointed spear completely redesigned and then redesigned again to lengthen the term of the model's use"") loaded with all 12 W80 in flouting of international law requiring that they be loaded with no more than far fewer warheads. The First Lady of the United States was one of the survivors of the nuclear attack by the United States against Israel. She eventually returned or was returned to the United States, where she was high on Abilify, and shot the President, who was drunken at the time, with a handgun, revealing his position to a hidden rifleman, who mortally wounded him by shooting him in the chest with the rifle. He soon died of wounds, and the allies of the United States unceremoniously abandoned the United States, calling it contemptible and weak. This was the President's fate, and the First Lady served approximately a year in sub-minimum security prison, and was released. She married another man, and he, she and her children ultimately died of non-preventable natural causes in old age. Unlike her marriage to the President, this marriage clearly lacked any trace whatsoever of abuse and was more less worthwhile. Given that the rifleman disappeared without trace, it's possible that he too died of non preventable natural causes in old age. 

Willow, her friend and the other convicts survived by being at sea. Corrective envisceration had impregnated none of them. This might have been their fate, but given the inadequate record-keeping of the era, it's also possible that someone rescued them and transformed them back into humans, after which they met a different fate, having never battered each other. 

Sacramento became the beautiful (and morbid) Sacramento Lake, a popular tourist destination inside the United States. The Second Israel - United States War happened. Then, the United States passed an amendment to the United States Constitution, plagiarizing Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, formally changing the United States military into the United States Self Defense Force. This enjoined them to dismantle and destroy the nuclear weapons, and though they were tardy in doing so, they ultimately did. The United States and Israel soon met their ultimate fates, alone, ignored, replaced and forgotten in what was left of international relations. 

Object lesson: 

If you're in the United States of America, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, or the State of Israel, leave before the year 2030 into a non abusive situation by any means necessary. Return is likely and it's not an option. Subject to this, accept that life is hard, unfair, and short, stay clean and dry, keep a secret journal, and be kind. People that you can have contact with are always people that you assume will unconditionally resemble, and subject to the resemblance, conform to you. 

THE END.

fsdpau,Character-Comb,How to tell the difference between futurology and science fantasy.,"Soft science fiction is usually a subjective experience in a technology-themed DMT bad trip. It is usually military science fantasy, and it's usually set in space. Futurism is not. Soft science fiction doesn't have to obey the laws of physics, and futurism obeys the laws of physics. If an experiment says that a material can turn iridescent using methods that were previously thought not possible, then the experiment might be real. However, if an experiment says that as long as it has a crew and overunity energy generation, a ship can go faster than light, then the experiment is probably not real. Another sign that something is not real is that it's similar to something like that is expressly disclaimed at the beginning as not real. This is basically fiction without the disclaimer that any similarity to any real person is purely coincidental. Herein, I will describe various tropes of fiction-like falsehood. Falsehoods are usually not intentional, nor do they result from some sort of abnormality. They are usually just opinion, or mistake. If there is an abnormality, usually it's not intentional falsehood, nor substance use nor mental illness, it's just slightly below-average intelligence. They usually scored somewhere between 21 and 27 on the Wonderlic employment test. This applies to even the most outrageous falsehoods. Also, herein I'll be using first movies that I've seen, mostly the Matrix, Tron, and The Last Starfighter. I'll be taking the names of the tropes from TV tropes. I've never had DMT, I swear. I got the stories of trips from Tales from the Trip, which is a YouTube series.

First, we are introduced to the main characters everyday life. We see that it is lame. The technical term for the trope is This Loser Is You. This corresponds to the pre-trip phase of the Psychonaut's life.

Then, the main character gets the Call to Adventure. Whether this comes in the form of an Internet chat, such as in the case of The Matrix, or a game, such as in Tron or The Last Starfighter, it's consummated in the appearance of some sort of side character. The environment may become shinier, brighter, more iridescent, or maybe develop lace-like patterns. In any case, this corresponds to the first hit of DMT the psychonaut takes.

Then, a complication sets in. This is probably a Leave Your Quest Test, and if there is a Leave Your Quest Test in the story, it's usually here. In The Matrix, Agent Smith melted Neo's face shut. In The Last Starfighter, one of the Krogan tried to shoot the main character. This corresponds to the psychonaut's second hit of DMT. The main character and the psychonaut both decide to push through.

Then, the main character visits some sort of facility, or enters a powerful vehicle. Whether expressly a nightclub, or whether it's a nightclub like environment, either way, there are lights, and there often are wires, peripherals, and displays. Usually the displays are transparent where they're not showing anything. Often the vehicle is bright white, although in a Used Future setting, it's often drab and dented. This part of the setting is usually inaccessible to normal characters. If there's a Masquerade, this is where it's lifted to audience. The story usually corresponds to a bad trip, so it's unclear if the psychonaut took the third hit.

Then, the main character tries to f*** someone. This is usually meant as and is a consensual, consummated sexual act. I am not sure why this is so, because the story is usually a war story, in the military this is just a misconduct offense, in war it's really hard to have sex, and really hard things that service members work on in war generally aren't getting away with having sex. In The Matrix, Neo and Trinity have sex. This corresponds to when the psychonaut has unsuccessful real life sex, or they fantasize about sex because they're too dysfunctional to have sex.

Then, the main character meets with a character. Whether they defeat an enemy, reject a cougar, a trickster figure promises to show them the meaning of life, and shows them a simple cat instead, or a gnome rejects them, either way they have an encounter but do not consummate a meaningful, friendly encounter. The character may die, once, or even several times. The entire thing doesn't take long enough to be realistic, such as you can go to a different planet every week or month.

Finally, everyday life goes on, and may be permanently changed. This corresponds to when the psychonaut wakes up from their trip. All told, the only difference between a subjective experience tripping on DMT and watching soft science fiction is that in a DMT trip, you're usually a cartoon character in a safe, supportive environment, and in soft science fiction, the main character is usually a live-action character, and they're a service member in a war. The hidden war theme is a trope of religion. There, it's usually portrayed as a war between two abstract concepts, usually good and evil. Well in real life it's usually two nations trying to torch each other's unwilling settlements over mineral resources or territory, not because of mineral resources nor territory, but because both nations are too lonely and frustrated to make concessions, and they're too equal in power.",0,1585664343,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fsdpau/how_to_tell_the_difference_between_futurology_and/,Futurology,1

We need a Universal Basic Movement.

—Universal Basic Income: Every 18+ year old citizen will have the right of receiving $1,000 a month with no bureaucracy, no strings attached.

—Universal Basic Health Care: Every citizen will have the right of high-quality healthcare.

—Universal Basic Education: Every citizen will have the right of a high-quality Preschool–12th grade education.

—Universal Basic Freedom: Every citizen will have the right of freedom of their own body and mind. Prison will be for violent criminals and not non-violent drug offenses. You will have the right to privacy, to delete your internet footprint and own your own data.

The infrastructure currently exists for all of this. It is reasonable and achievable. Politicians are supposed to act in our interest and carry out our collective will. We must demand this with no quarter.

If anyone says we can’t afford it, they are lying.

frx84m,kernals12,My Predictions for 2050,"\-Most repetitive tasks will be automated by AI able to perform one shot and unsupervised learning resulting in productivity (and hourly compensation) being about 70% higher than now.

\-All electricity will come from satellites collecting solar power and beaming it down to earth. Power will cost less than 1 cent per kwh

\-Transportation, with the exception of space rockets, will be entirely battery powered and will be autonomous. Electric cars will have motors mounted in their wheel hubs, freeing up interior space and lowering manufacturing costs. Passenger trains will be gone, replaced by electric VTOL aircraft. For long distance travel, electric power will make hypersonic flight economical, making it possible to get from New York to Singapore in about 2 hours

\-Steel will have largely been replaced by either carbon nanotubes or metallic glass

\-Telecommuting, driverless cars, and VTOL planes will allow a great dispersal of population and economic activity. Financial institutions and law firms will join most other corporations in moving to the suburbs. Traditional cities of today will be in rapid decline

\-Homes will be made of extruded metallic glass or some sort of polymer in factories and will be dropped off on the lot by helicopter. A 2500 square foot home, not including land or foundation work, will cost about $50,000.

\-Food will be produced synthetically, no more farms, and most of our meals will be preprepared by robots with most of our sustenance coming from grocery store hot bars, the frozen food aisle, and restaurants. Tagatose, an artificial sweetener with only 40% as many calories as regular sugar and with no harmful side effects, will allow us to eat junk food guilt free

\-We will have at least one manned space colony providing labor for the space economy, including the aforementioned solar power satellites, but also communications and weather satellites, the manufacturing of crystals, alloys, and drugs, the assembly of spacecraft for deep space exploration, and tourism

\-Satellites will result in much lower internet and cell phone service costs without the billions of miles of cable currently needed to provide web service

\-Clothing will be temperature controlled to ensure maximum comfort all year round

\-We will have reliable means of altering the weather. Lasers will seed the clouds causing or preventing precipitation, and thinning or thickening cirrus clouds to cool or warm certain areas. Marine Cloud Brightening will allow us to snuff out hurricanes by cooling down the equatorial waters

\-Gene drives will allow us to kill off any pests we so choose, freeing us from, among other things, disease carrying mosquitoes and tree killing beetles

\-Quantum computers will let us finally crack protein folding and let us cure alzheimer's, type ii diabetes, parkinsons and many other diseases, the effect being a great reduction in the need for nursing home care and reduced healthcare costs

\-New types of immunotherapy will mostly bring cancer to heal and make it only deadly to the very elderly

\-Psychadelics will wipe out addiction, finally bringing us victory in the war on drugs and eliminating the many social problems caused by substance abuse

I think our future will be one of wonder and abundance and the prophets of doom and gloom are going to be wrong yet again",26,1585595949,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/frx84m/my_predictions_for_2050/,Futurology,1

fr6mxx,Complex-Tailor,Why the USA could be communist before the end of the year,"I am indeed a kind, nimble man, and I tell you: everyone's job is fucked, and it is all going down because the whole world is in a standstill. There has barely ever been such a thing, as the whole world on a standstill...

The consequences are *vast and profound*. People can't pay their *dues*, so that there will be no solution but to override the landlords, and to override the banking system.

We can't send billions of people home... We have to preserve our inertia, and our intricate civilization... We *need* the workers to go to work, and *seize the means of production*. 

We don't pay the rent, and we don't pay the loan... We just work as usual, and watch it all organize itself accordingly -- the bankers get fucked, not the people. 

It is also time we sieze the housing system, and issue a lodging to every citizen... No more empty housing, no more housing speculation... We can do it. Dream big!

We are going to change systems for a system which *works for us*, not the other way around. 

There is *no choice* but to grant Universal Basic Income, so that the worker isn't enslaved to work, and isn't *over-producing*...

If you want to survive climate change, we have to *stop over-producing*, like yesterday -- wouldn't you agree? That means giving people the freedom to produce at their own rate, and at the best value...

The world has changed, and now communism is ready to shine, because corruption is not such a problem anymore. 

The US has created a [digital dollar ledger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2020/03/23/new-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-introduces-digital-dollar-and-digital-dollar-wallets/). We just have to make it public, and allow the citizens to peer live into the government's accounts, over a website portal. 

We can also make every meeting streamed online to the public, so there is nothing to hide. 

We are not in 1920 anymore... Communism is *hard*, indeed, and so it faltered, but *now we can succeed*. Indeed, communism is empowered by internet and computers, because we are highly organized, and highly transparent. 

I will be pushing for the social ownership of the resources and of the housing, because it is *the right thing to do*. We will all be wealthier, believe it or not, once the worker will earn his fair share. You are owed some check to cash, and I will fight everyday for you to wake up and cash that check.

Believe! It will happen, even if I have to push my speeches deep down Trump's throat.

People focusing more on what is important; shopping for example, the average person not wasting monies on sugary snacks but on bread, fruit and veg.

fqyd4v,One-Profit,My predictions on long-term societal changes after the COVID-19 pandemic,"I'll keep my points brief to avoid repeating arguments we've seen hashed out on this forum before. I'm interested in your comments.

**1/ The Cashless Society:** With paper money and coins being a vector for disease, we are seeing an increase of people paying with card. Cash is an outdated method of payment that belongs in the 20th century. The costs of creating, storing, transporting and counting physical currency are not worth it. The reduction in crime and tax evasion are bonuses. Society is already heading in the direction of the cashless society. This crisis will just help accelerate it. Countries like Sweden and China are already ahead of the curve.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*Loss of privacy:* you either care about this or you don't. Personally speaking, I have nothing to hide. I don't care if the government knows I bought McDonalds three times in a week. Besides, so much of your shopping habits are already being tracked by grocery store loyalty cards and the Amazon algorithm.

*Charities will suffer:* There is nothing stopping generous people donating food and clothes directly instead of giving cash which may be mis-spent of drugs/alcohol. Even the beggar on the street in a third world country seems to have a smartphone these day. I'm sure he wouldn't refuse Venmo.

**2/ Working from home:** Now that many businesses' hands have been forced, we have learned that working from home *is* possible. It will be hard to justify making employees commute an hour to work when it's possible to complete their work at home. Bonuses include: Less overheads such as rent and electricity for businesses. Less traffic on the roads and therefore less pollution. Rise in quality of life for workers who no longer give up large parts of their day for free in pointless commutes.

To preempt some some counter-arguments:
*I enjoy the social interaction with my coworkers and I feel more productive in the office:* This is a personal opinion. Perhaps working from home a few days a week could be made optional.

**3/ Reduction in the movement of people:** This is a political point so I expect some controversy, but this crisis has proven that strong borders are important. Free movement of goods can be allowed while greatly restricting the movement of people. The pipedream of free movement within the EU has taken a massive blow and I bet the Italians wish they had taken greater control of who they let into their homeland.

The airline industry in particular is getting hit hard and I predict the reduction in number of flights will linger long after this crisis has passed. There is no need for dozens of daily flights funneling Africans and Asians into Europe. Life can go on just fine if they stay in their part of the world and we stay in ours.

On the plus side, it's heart warming to see young Europeans helping out the elderly in our society by offering to pick up groceries in the shops for them. The kind of behavior you can expect to see (and that we used to see) in a homogeneous, high-trust society. Let's wind the clock back on this dangerous globalization nonsense.

fqpdpw,worldpeace4us,New Earth Order (NEO),"  

 1. Full Disclosure by all ruling bodies, government, judicial, military, medical, scientific and religious. We demand the complete whole truth, the good the bad and the ugly. Only then can proper decisions be made.

 2. Rewrite history with full disclosure. This will expose the atrocities of the past so we can learn from them. 

 3. Abolish all federal governments. Federal borders are political property lines, useless for people living together. Modern communication has relieved us of the need for federal governments. By limiting governed areas you increase accountability and impede corruption, your vote counts now more than ever.

 4. All ""Zones"" (City or County or Tribal populations) govern themselves according to the will of the native population with input from residents and settlers. Native defined as over 100 generations improving the same area, resident over 10 generations, settlers under 10 generations. 

 5. Land and natural resources are no longer privately owned but leased from earths population for funding a worldwide ""EMS"" (Earth Medical Service) and Zones. 

 6. Use EMS to police the Zones, replenish earths natural resources, clean pollution, improve infrastructure and provide disaster relief. Many EMS systems are already started but are wasted waging war. Start by integrating the army's and navy's worldwide. Now that they're on the same side, no more war, instead EMS provides schooling, training and great jobs. Other examples of EMS could include Health care, Forest Service ect..  All prisons become garbage recycling centers. 

 7. All Zones taxed on resources used and waste produced. Produce more resources than you use to lower taxes. Produce no waste (solid, air, sound or water pollution that will negatively affect others) and provide more resources than you use for low or no taxes.

 8. Immediately phase out burning of fossil fuels. All nuclear waste to be expelled from earth, no more landfills or depleted uranium bullets. It's not technology if it harms earth. We must limit things competing with us for oxygen like internal combustion engines, destruction of chlorophyll producers and livestock. All future decisions made with earths interests before humanities, hopefully we survive this mess. 

 9. After the year 2020 full accountability for crimes against humanity and nature. 

 10. Start teaching a sign language worldwide as a second language. This eliminates the language barrier in business, travel and vacations.

 11. Implement a blockchain that uses individuals value. Use a “PTV"" (personal trade value) that incorporates a point system to include complexity of the profession, schooling, demand for service, personal ability, your feedback for services rendered and experience. Example, heart surgeon has a PTV 11 is visited by a bus driver PTV 2, bus driver is healed, doc spent 10 hours, bus driver pays 10x11 divided by 2 so 55 hours are transferred to doc account. You earn according to ability and pay according to service.

 12. All entity's of earth, not of this earth or any entity visiting this dimension shall not initiate force, threat of force or fraud against my life and property and, any and all contracts I'm a party to by not giving full disclosure to me whether signed by me or not are void at my discretion. Give Love, if we as one civilization sharing this world decide to change now (immediately) I believe only then will the heavens open to us.

 13. Classify earth life into 3 categories. Native of Earth, Not Native of Earth and hybrid.",11,1585419444,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fqpdpw/new_earth_order_neo/,Futurology,0

fq6ffc,KnightOfThirteen,"As we move into a future with ever advancing robotics and artificial intelligence, it is going to become possible to custom order a life-like humanoid robot. How will social taboos change?","The possibilities of what a person will be able to do without harm are unlimited and alarming. Things that are completely abhorrent now may become commonplace. Things which are non-existent non issues now may become huge legal concerns.

I am interested in people's thoughts on how such technology will be used and abused, and the changes in legality and socially perceived morality caused by effectively a combined sexual and digital revolution.

Some of the things that have occurred to me, in roughly ascending order of concern:

1. A robot made up of an amalgamation of your personal tastes from hundreds of sources, using a Pandora-like system to build a look and personality profile that perfectly suits you. A new person that has never existed.

2. A robot made off of a standard model, a real person who donated their likeness specifically for this. Likely someone you will never meet.

3. A robot made in the likeness of someone who has passed away and is unable to give consent. A person who no longer exists.

4. A robot duplicate of a celebrity, with or without their concent. A person in the public eye.

5. A robot duplicate of someone you know, by your request. A crush, co worker, ex?

6. A robot duplicate of a relative.

7. A robot duplicate of yourself.

8. A robot of a fictional person, books, movies, cartoons, anime. A fantasy brought to life.

9. A robot of an inappropriate physical age.

10. A robot with non-human characteristics. Cat girls, furries, elves, aliens.

11. A robot that is completely non-humanoid.

Not all concern have to be sexual. There is also an element of privacy rights, copyright and royalties, invalidity of most vision-based evidence (pictures, video, eye witnesses), robot rights.

fq54wb,ozbljud,Virtual tourism and mother nature as a inevitable step in advancing our civilization,"Almost a year ago I had a real meltdown concerning the future of our planet. My daugther was about to be born and we have been bombed with all the info about the climate change. I do not question the intention behind those callings, however I must admit it was exhausting.
I personally started to feel like I am the worst human being to ever live, cause I do not recycle enough, not segregate enough, use too much of plastic and generally eat very unhealthy and buy food from sources only contributing to the problem. I have managed to make some improvements and am generally more aware as of how to spend my money but well, I still think its not enough. Especially when you hear about stuff like some ship dumped trash into the sea because paying the fee is still less money then utilizing it properly. Its hard to be on guard all the time, when your actions are only a drop in the ocean.

However, I had this idea that well, if we are ever going to become the interstellar civilization, then destroying our planet will be a valid step at some point. Just to gather the material (given that we can morph the elements freely and efficiently) to build the megastructures to harvest more energy from the dying sun, it would require to use all the material we can get in the solar system (not just Earth's, although that's the only planet with pretty trees and so on; btw I am all for nature, dont get me wrong).

I am certain that our progress is nowhere near such actions would that really be something just needs to happen at some point? Like with the planet in one of the Star Wars movie, all covered with infrastructure.

I am not proclaiming that we should just abandon all the care that the planet needs, but a lot is being talked about decreasing animal diversity in the ecosystem and all the causes behind it. CO2 emissions and all, but the main cause is just expanding human population and grabbing the land to ourselves. Can we really restrict the births to prevent that? Will the population grow indefinitely?

The ideas from the title, I think its essential for humans to have some kind of a bond with nature and to live close with it. Even having some plants in the house is already enhancing the mood and atmosphere. But if all the mountains and rivers and forests will be needed to build structures we might eventually need, how will we experience all that? Would virtual reality be an option to that, visit all the nice places that mother nature once shaped but they are not there anymore?

Maybe in 500 years people will look back at us laughing, at their ancestors who were desperately trying to preserve the planet which was doomed anyway. I mean, the sun will not be there forever (not in its current form anyway) and I know that this vision is as futuristic as it can be and there is little point in planning it at the moment, but well, what do you think?

Is it that we are just not ready yet to survive without all the environment supporting our lives, but once we are advanced enough we will be able to truly get on board with the total destruction (or deconstruction)?",3,1585341343,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fq54wb/virtual_tourism_and_mother_nature_as_a_inevitable/,Futurology,1

fpuy9g,FloppyGrandmaTitties,"In the future, we desperately need to revamp how we shop for essential goods during times of crisis","The way that the coronavirus crisis was handled in the United States was absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible by Major grocery stores. For example, Costco. in the midst of a viral outbreak where you're supposed to say 6 feet apart from one another, what does Costco do? Let everyone line app for miles 10 inches from one another and then all crammed inside the same store where all of them can get infected 10 * more easily. Plus, Costco allowed consumers to participate in panic buying, where they bought three or four times as much as they needed to. 



But what we desperately need for the future is to double down on the in-store pickup that many stores offer, and use that to our advantage in times of crisis. The way this would work is quite simple. Just like Walmart does it, people would have to place an appointment for in-store pickup and could only go at the allotted time. But during times of crisis, the app would direct you to the store in your local area that has the next available appointment, rather than just the store you are looking at. So this way, everyone has a fair chance of getting supplies in a timely manner, and you won't have any issues of overcrowding like 3,000 people going to the same Costco. 



This would solve numerous problems. First, it would allow consumers to know exactly what is available in store because every single item in store should be accounted for on the online application. Second, it would protect consumers from getting exposed to other people unnecessarily. Third, it would allow the panic and chaos to be alleviated. During these crises, there's no plan in place, there's no measures to protect consumers, so everyone pretty much just goes wherever they want and panics because they don't know what is going to happen. Having something like this would help alleviate that strain because there would be an actual process.",24,1585306610,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fpuy9g/in_the_future_we_desperately_need_to_revamp_how/,Futurology,1

fps1it,kernals12,The Post-Downtown Era,"Downtown long ago lost much of its importance. Most corporate headquarters moved out to suburban office parks and the great big department stores moved to shopping malls leaving behind just banks, insurance companies, law firms and other businesses that needed to be in a location easily accessible to clients. But now with technology, it seems likely even those firms will no longer need to be in great big downtown skyscrapers.

Lots of jobs can be done largely remotely with maybe only 1 or 2 days per week spent person to person and coronavirus could accelerate that move. Great advances in transportation are on the horizon too. Driverless cars, by perfect coordination, will be able to double or even triple the capacity of highways, almost eliminating traffic jams and greatly increasing the radius of commuters. And passenger drones could be a reality soon, further speeding point to point transportation. A large bank with a suburban corporate campus will be easily accessible to clients arriving by air. 

This will be a great shift, negating the need for us to cram together in big cities. We could each have 1 acre of land to ourselves. The huge premiums for urban land will vanish and we'll have far more flexibility in where we live, who needs to pay Silicon Valley real estate prices when you can just live in Sonoma? Sadly, this means lots of great landmarks will be demolished. Who'll need the Empire State Building or the World Trade Center when office space in White Plains or Stamford is so cheap? 

But ultimately, the effect will be positive. Humans were never meant to be packed like sardines. We will be a freer, happier species when downtown becomes obsolete and all the great skyscrapers are left to rust.",10,1585290267,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fps1it/the_postdowntown_era/,Futurology,1

fpnxpq,pm_me_your_shade,A study that can be done today that can teach us about how to handle future pandemics,"   TL;DR We can create an atmosphere that is conducive to healing to  strategically immunize people.  Planned infection limits the  individual's potential collateral damage (spread to family and friends)  of people who are highly likely to contract the disease 

## 1. Project  Background and Description

&amp;#x200B;

In an emergency, we place the interests of society above   that of the individual. The two are   not mutually exclusive but rather dependent on one another. Individual freedoms are protected by our   society, and without individuals, society would cease to exist. 

The societal impacts of an epidemic are far reaching and   potentially devastating to our way of life. The negative consequences economically, socially, and psychologically   cannot be quantified at this time but are worrisome.

In China, an early mandatory lockdown was largely effective   in slowing and possibly stopping the spread of COVID-19. In the USA, this option is past it’s time,   as it would require a prolonged total lockdown that would devastate the   economy. The cure cannot be worse than   the disease. 

We are at a historical inflection point and we have a   narrowing window to prepare the people fighting for all of us. As of today, I am not aware of any scalable   exogenous substance that will prohibit or cure COVID-19. We will eventually develop a vaccine or   find a cure, but we are currently in a race against time. We may run out of personal protective   equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds. We cannot wait for the inevitable and look only towards the stripping   of individual freedoms as our cudgel to address this problem. 

Once immunity to COVID-19 is acquired, the likelihood of   reinfection is negligible. Acquired   immunity is therefore our most primitive, yet most effective tool to use in   our fight. We can create the conditions conducive to healing and grow our   understanding by exposing healthy individual volunteers to COVID-19. 

We don’t expect a marathoner to run a race without training,   we should not expect our front-line workers to fight the battle of their life   without some preparation. This pandemic cannot be fought on a single front,   we must use our resources and creativity to align the values of individuals   and society. We are all scared,   confused, and in isolation. We will   get through this, and we will do it together. 

## 2. Project Scope

&amp;#x200B;

This project must be limited to volunteers and people should   not be coerced to volunteer. The   relative risk of infection in the wild must be approaching 1 (they are going   to get it whether they join this study or not). This must be a collaborative effort between   government, the medical community and you. All interaction with the public (social media) is voluntary but   encouraged (we are all in this together). The participants can be taught coping mechanisms and lifestyle   modifications (diet, exercise). We can come out of this catastrophe better   prepared for the next epidemic.",4,1585272065,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fpnxpq/a_study_that_can_be_done_today_that_can_teach_us/,Futurology,1

So that we have to go to our offices far **less**

So that we can damage the environment **less**

And spend **less** money on cars and planes

So that we can spend **less** hours on our work in general

So that we can spend **more** hours on things we like and with each other

And that by getting this satisfaction out of life, we might consume and need **less**

So we would need **less** money

And that the things we do still need, should be ordered **more** online

So that we create a modern lifestyle that actually fits our generation more

That some companies would just not be needed anymore

And we can have **less** stores and offices

And that we can use this space to create **more** houses and grow more nature

So we can support the environment and the people **more**

So many things we actually don’t need, is provided by jobs we don’t need

There would be **more** people available to work in education and healthcare

And there are **fewer** companies that make unnecessary profit over other peoples backs

So there are **less** companies and entities that people owe money to

And people can have **less** dept

And that a government doesn’t need to spend all that money on supporting poor people

So we can spend **more** money to healthcare and education

And that people can spend their own money **more** on themselves and their families

So we can have **more** possibilities in life

And we can create **more** possibilities for others

So that we can focus on giving ourselves a better life

&amp;#x200B;

And by giving people a better life to create a better world, I mean this

There is a World Health Organisation

Should there be a World Ethics Organisation?

And have an entity like the United Nations actually listen to it?

Where people together decide what is right and what is wrong and have that actually endorsed?

So that we can shut down scumbags like this:

Read that story and tell me it didn’t shock you. And if you think now that this is only happening with this vaccine, this happens all the time!

&amp;#x200B;

Some companies should not be able to operate like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Take this quarantine time or extra personal time and see what you like and enjoy it

Be happy

Need less

Buy less

Pay of your depts

Spend money on a nice office chair or education

And try to working from home more often when this is over

fpf1kq,1011011110,This is how we'll jumpstart biological immortality.,"Japanese folklore includes this little note about how kami revived animals from whom their meat had been taken:

&gt;There is also a ceremony called Kebokai performed after shooting an  animal. First the animal’s lips, nose, eyeballs, ears, nails and other  parts that are thought to contain its soul are removed, the animal is  skinned, the skin is reversed, the carcass is covered with the skin and  the heart is offered to the mountain kami. They believed that by leaving  the heart and carcass, the animal could be revived by the mountain  Goddess. 

[https://yokaigrove.com/2014/05/25/death-and-mountain-kami-origins-of-shinto/](https://yokaigrove.com/2014/05/25/death-and-mountain-kami-origins-of-shinto/)

This is essentially how we would do full-body transplants.  It may even be possible to put livestock that have had all their meat removed into a cell culture for regeneration and re-butchering within just a couple of months.  The procedure would be ideal for organ harvesting because it would preserve everything that may be of use.

We would want to preserve the individual's unique perceptions, which means including, if possible, their original eyes, tongue, nose, fingertips, lips, genitals, and so on.  It may even mean preserving the digestive system or microbiome.  If we can develop bio-compatible skin that registers the same amount of sensitivity and can be custom-printed for an exact match to the target patient, we won't need to preserve so much skin.

Imagine going through this cycle a couple of dozen times, all the while appearing no older than twenty-five.  Eventually, we'll get to the point where less and less must be preserved, and may even be able to transplant *just* the seat of consciousness into an artificial brain.  I don't think we'll ever reach a point where digital immortality is possible, because the digital version becomes only a copy the moment the biological consciousness ceases to exist, but there will come a time when a person's brain is only 1% biological and the 99% that is digital lives forever.

Hopefully we'll be able to rejuvenate the seat of consciousness indefinitely using stem cell technology.  If not, death is on the distant horizon.",5,1585241837,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fpf1kq/this_is_how_well_jumpstart_biological_immortality/,Futurology,0

fpdnhy,Yozhur,My vision about technological and evolutional advancement of the universe and humanity,"Hmm what does the good stories start with? Funny mind bending prologue?

# Everything that is written here is all my own thoughts. My thoughts can be liable to change as i process these mysteries of our existence. So be wary.

Shall we see upon the first word of my vision. Technology and evolution of human species. As our species started. We were fish. While crawling to the land of earth we had to evolve into species which could live on land. After many cycles of evolution, our species had adapted to the lifestyle of a land species. We started on four legs. Time and time our species tried to get better on bipolar style. That allowed for our first real technological evolution. We were able to use our hands as tools that allowed our humanity's mind to create different kind of small technological steps. Creating fire was huge step as it taught to them about physics and chemistry of the universe. Humanity then tried to learn how to produce that mythical thing that they saw. What a wondrous sight it must have been for the species **at the time of their evolution.** Species now sparked with this revolutionary energy which started their brain/mind/humanity to thirst for that energy. We want that energy, give it all to me screamed their humanity or what ever it is that we could call ourselves. Evolving thorough the decades after decades. Stars, like the sun were most likely the first energy source we found, but fire on earth is the step we were talking about.

The step to get **sustainable energy**. As we adapted and adapted more into the technological advancement of our brain. We were able to obtain the energy more easily and in higher quantity than ever before. Now further in the timeline we were able to harness the energy so well, that our brain started to learn about things other than, it's sole purpose of harnessing the energy. Using the energy source to create different kind of tools and equipment to ease harnessing the energy. So much power, said the being. It's brain got enormously overloaded by energy, which allowed for its true entity to appear. Entity now able to share energy for many branches which then branch into more branches. A jungle of energy branches is what we could call that entity. Energy was now evolving in many new way's. It's hard to imagine how many energy branches there were evolving inside this entity. Multiplying on tremendous speed. Yearning for more, more and more of the so called energy. This is only thing we can do to get to our real reason for being.

Our real reason for being is still way beyond the humanity's technology. To speak the truth, it might be way sooner than we ever expected. What have we always wanted? Energy. That is the sole purpose of our being. Stars? That is what we call those energy sources. The being called humanity yearns to get ever closer to those energy sources. That's why about now humanity is trying to ascend closer to those realms of new enormous era of energy. Space is a big mystery for humanity. It's a place humanity has to traverse in attempt to harness the mysteries of the realm. First step toward that dream was watching clouds float and feeling the embrace of the sky where you soar through the clouds.

# COVID-19

How COVID-19 relates to all of this. you may wonder why, would it have any special meaning for our humanity. We must firstly grasp the idea of earth and the universe

So The virus is really nasty pest. It Spreads through the whole humanity. Infecting every single being in such a short time humanity can't fight back against it. So what can we do as humanity to fight against this world destroying pest. That's where our being's most valuable thing is core. It becomes our most valuable thing to protect our supply of energy against this pest. So what are the things humanity is struggling with. What is our being imagining about what we should do in this case? Protect the core. Our core is the apex of our being. We need to do everything we can to save this energy. We will protect it by sacrificing the weakest part of our unity.

**THE CULL**

The cull is starting to happen. No matter what humanity does we can't stop it from spreading. We need to minimize the loss of humanity from the weakest parts which our being doesn't need anymore. All input tools we have will be lost as we struggle against the pest. It's trying to steal our energy we have gathered from time to time again. As humanity is struggling communicating with the other things that have been able to communicate back. This has been working so far. We had some outbreaks before. But this outbreak. There's no way hundreds of millions of lives will be lost.

So what are our weakest parts as an symbiotic energy sphere which has evolved it's threads to extraordinary lenghts. When we evolve. There is always the risk for an opposing force or thing or whatever we imagine it to be to appear as we try to communicate with all the thing's with our input systems. COVID is just that. It communicates with us, but it doesn't want to coexist. It wants to eat us. But we are stronger than it.

Well...Most of us are. Senior citizens have really rough time. The mortality rate is highest age 60+. That age group is humanity's one of if not biggest weakness in technological advancement. Their bodies are weak. Their energy source is starting to dim out. Outer shell is crumbling away. Still able to operate even if missing parts of outer shell. But too weak to fight against stronger core that wants to conquer your energy within your core. Pest wants to expand its territory. And oh boy that is what it is doing. It will affect every single core in our being. But gladly our being is stronger than the virus. By removing it's weakest parts like the senior citizens it can preserve way more energy to technologically advance. All this to make our being stronger and it destroying the virus in the end. We will see unimaginable number of casualties, but we the strong part of humanity have to do our utmost best to survive this cataclysm. We need to preserve ourselves for the future civilization to secure surviving while advancing technology as fast as we can. Only technology can extinguish the cataclysm and evolve us to beings beyond our imagination

(Under Work by huge amounts)

The earth has gravity in it's athmosphere. Athmosphere then pulls everything that happens to be inside it's radius towards the center. Humanity has been fighting this gravity for as long as they have existed. Now that humanity has come to this point of time where we have no need to be so tall to do things succesfully. Our kind has taken technology to the point of making us become curled up. As an example i have 3 different cases where we can apply this rule.

First of all we have **communication worldwide.** This rule applies as humanity no longer needs to move the enormous amount of distances like before. We can do everything via communication. I mean, you can pretty much get everything you could imagine if you had enough money. Without moving at all. Whilst previously humanity had to move hundreds of kilometers to get simple tasks done. Might be way more than that in reality.

We don't need to be so tall because everything is becoming smaller and smaller. We are adapting to becoming smaller ourselves because, being bigger would actually be weakness when, adapting humanity to technology as one being.

As our generation is starting to curl up by different technological innovations. Firstly as we started to learn the means of traveling saving more of our brain's energy. We didn't need our legs that much anymore. Nowadays you can easily live your life without your legs. That's a part of missing energy from our center or being or whatever we are. We can function more effectively by removing part of our clumsy outer shell. What is the purpose of our outer shell called body? To maximize the potential of harnessing energy we get to our being. Now that our legs are starting to slow our evolution down. Our being is starting to remove it's outer shell part by part. Legs seems to be one of the first signs of our outer shell fading away piece by piece.

Hand's are our input system for the being. Hands are clumsy at doing what they are doing. With hands we can create things that we can imagine with our being. Something mythical can be created but the input is limiting our potential at creating things we can imagine. If we could maximize the output's value to better understand our outer shell's input commands. Every single thing in our being is an input tool. Everything we do with our input systems feeds our being with extraordinary amounts of information. Which our being then tries to process for the input systems to materialize the things we imagine. Yes, even those imaginations of Mythical evolution of the universe. All this in order to maximize the potential of harvesting energy for our core. Now humanity no longer needs their input tools to use it's most potential to materialize things our being can imagine.

So How would our technological advancement's come into the story. Well that is one big chapter to talk about. First we could go as far as Communication becoming a thing. Humanity was able to learn how to interact with other thing's in the universe. Other things that wanted that same energy. As we were able to interact with this other being, we could input tremendous amount of information by sharing with the other being. Compared to the other input systems we had evolved this was truly revolutionizing step.

This is just a draft of my thought at the moment. More will appear as i'm able to materialize my thoughts. There is way too much information for my brain to output that my input system is too slow to process into information that others can understand. This might be work of my deppression added with huge panic about huge part of the world dying to covid-19 virus. It will affect the world way more than any of us can imagine. I'm trying to think everything about the universe to solve this question of our existence. I'm wonder if i'm the lone being thinking this way or is there more of us. Beings longing to be heard, but you can't materialize your output potential to it's peak. What if you could, With other beings just like you? Then my main question to you is.

foydyj,lsl345,"I’m building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a tree when you die and puts that tree in a memorial forest. Help me make this a movement.","Hey folks, I want you to imagine something for a sec: what if instead of mourning our loved ones in graveyards dedicated to death, we celebrated them in forests dedicated to life?
I'm trying to make this vision a reality by building reLive, the sustainable death care solution that turns your body into a memorial tree when you die (by mixing CO2-neutrally cremated ashes with seeds and soil), and lays that tree to rest into a 'memorial forest' space – the graveyard of the 21st century.
I have a lot of visions for what this forest space would be like – it would be a beautiful, tranquil place you want to stay awhile. It would be a place for reflecting on the past and reconnecting with the present and with nature. There would be regular events to keep the space alive.
I am even imagining planting QR codes at the base of each memorial tree – when you scan them, these codes would pull up a live forum where friends and relatives of that person can post memories and photos, giving you an insight into who they were. It's the best way for someone coming to the end of their life to complete the circle of life and leave a sustainable legacy, and its a new way for all of us who remain to stay connected to those we have lost.
If you think this is a great concept, please join the movement! All you have to do is sign this petition: https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/relive-the-sustainable-death-care-solution
The more signatures I have, the more I can demonstrate people are interested in this, and the more likely I am to find an investor who will help me bring this concept to life.

I am not so sure.

In theory telecommuting allows employers to do away with the enormous costs of office space, which, in the more desirable places, can cost tens of thousands of dollars per worker. It means workers are never late due to traffic and they can work even if they have a cold. It also eliminates geographic barriers to recruiting.

Given all of this, you'd think employers would've adopted telecommuting a long time ago. I'm guessing there's probably a very good reason why they haven't.",28,1585161033,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fovfms/my_skepticism_about_remote_work/,Futurology,1

There will be many challenges and problems to be overcome but we are good at solving problems and making things work. Benefits will result when we learn how to do this.  Less driving to workplaces or schools will help slow down climate change. There will be less transportation expense, less traffic, less office buildings and schools will need to be constructed and maintained. Diseases such as the current pandemic but also the yearly cycle of flu and colds could be reduced while the economy still functions.

Most education could be done remotely. Teachers would still be needed to direct studies, do remote lessons, grade practices, give evaluation tests and certify educational achievement.  There are problems that need to be overcome such as socialization, distribution of materials, care of young people if their parents need to work away from home and lunches during the day.  Problems could be overcome such as bullying, driving and busing students and teachers, mass shootings and disruptive students. What are other problems and benefits that would happen with remote education?

Most office work involves people sitting at a desk and working on a computer and phone.  This could be done at home with an internet connection.  Driving and traffic would be reduced saving the time and expense.  As an example today, many news and opinion shows have their hosts and guests video commuting and working from their homes.

When it doesn't work out, it actually can feel like someone has died, or like the Apocalypse.  But when a real Apocalypse is happening outside, small talk falls away and there is even more of a chance for these intense connections.

The virus is going to change our society, hopefully we can make some good changes, but humans are stupid and petty so I'm worried.

I'm a extrovert who thrives on human contact, so social distancing is one of the hardest things for me to have to do.  In a way, I would prefer this were a hurricane so I could at least get my big group of friends together to do something about it.  It's going to be hard to sit inside and feel like I'm doing nothing while front-line healthcare workers are getting sick.

Seriously, what I want is someone equally paranoid about transmitting the virus to their family who I click with well enough with that we will put ourselves in some mild risk to get that needed human touch, but who is otherwise being careful.  We need to hold on to our humanity through this.

I live in the West End, 5'10"", 7"", with a muscley, chest-hairy Daddy Bear build after a really decent fitness transformation over the past couple of years.

fndqfy,Hav1ngFunn,More People = More Pandemics???,"I've been thinking about this for a while now, even before the outbreak of Covid-19. I've already posted this question, in different forms, to a couple other subreddits, but I haven't received a satisfying answer yet.

Basically, I'm thinking along these lines:

1. Pathogens use hosts as safe harbors for reproduction.
2. An increase in the number of hosts represents an increase in reproductive opportunities for a pathogen.
3. The more a pathogen reproduces itself, the more mutations accumulate in its genetic code.
4. The more mutations that occur, the more likely it is for a new strain of a disease to emerge. Such a new strain may be more virulent, and/or more resistant to treatment, and/or able to bypass the defenses of a previous vaccine.
5. Such new strains can manifest epidemics and pandemics.
6. As the human population grows, the number of possible human-hosts for an infection also increases.
7. Therefore, an increase in the human population, **in and of itself**, will result in an increased frequency of epidemics and pandemics. (See statements 1-6.)

**TL;DR** more people = more hosts = more opportunities for mutation &amp; transmission = more frequent plagues!

Also, it doesn't help that an increase in human population can lead to an increase in human interactions with animals, making cross-species transmission more likely.

Eventually, if no other limit to population growth presents itself, could we get to the point where pandemics occur every year? Or where **multiple** pandemic infections occur every year? 

Would this, if nothing else, put a cap on the potential human population of Earth? 

If we colonize space, could this effect limit the total human population in the Solar System?

If I'm wrong, please tell me why.

fn80ne,Memetic1,An interesting dilemma for you all to discuss.,"So in theory if we as a society decided to we could allow the government or say a corporation to track our location, and help us avoid collisions with other possibly asymptomatic carriers. I think we as a society should assume at this point that everyone is a potential asymptomatic carrier. Ideally we would all be isolated in separate rooms, but that's clearly not feasable. However we could create a sort of virtual room around a person. An airspace if you would.

Now the downside is absolutely obvious. The downside is a huge privacy violation, but you could make it so that no actual human would see the data. You could for example have the data processed and encrypted at your end. Then sent on to the nearest server where the all of the routing information is optimized to avoid infection. This clearly would have risks, but I personally assume they have my location already. 

So I wanted to propose this idea. We could even make it an augmented reality app. That way people could see relative risks in real time.",4,1584913951,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fn80ne/an_interesting_dilemma_for_you_all_to_discuss/,Futurology,1

Now, when it gets too hot, our utility company simply turns off all power in the community as a precaution. It sometimes stays off for up to a week.

When consumers are billed by the utility company that distributes power, one of the associated fees is related to the transfer of power to its destination (our homes). This $$$ amount increases during hotter months because energy is more easily lost during its transfer... e.g. we pay for 160% of the power because 60% is lost during transfer.

As global temperature increases due to climate change, paired with the utilization spikes on smaller, ""less prepared"" power grids, how much does fire danger increase during the hotter summer months?

fmejmp,SurveyPuppy,[HELP] Should I major in ChemE or ECE?," Hi guys,

So I am a freshman in engineering that is undecided. I am really interested in working on renewable energy in the future. I was intending to do ChemE because I have always enjoyed chemistry classes. I am really interested in solar energy and discovering a new energy source just as algae-based solutions. These two majors have caught my attention. My concern is that if I do ECE I will just end up in a coding job, and if I do Chem. I will end up in the oil/gas industries. I have also seen that ChemE's end up going to research, but I am really interested in working with a team in the industry sector after college. I just want a broad major that will allow me to explore my passion for renewable energy systems.

Any advice on how I should decide my major would be greatly appreciated!!",4,1584795347,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fmejmp/help_should_i_major_in_cheme_or_ece/,Futurology,1

fme1hr,FloppyGrandmaTitties,"If we invest more in healthcare in the future, we won't have to fear for our lives, and see the economy ruined","This coronavirus crisis could have easily been averted if more was invested in healthcare. Private companies and employers are so suspicious and resistance against investing in healthcare for individuals, or in hospitals, and governments don't really want to contribute more money to revamping the hospital system in any country.... 


So we are left with hospitals that don't have enough room for people, very few medical researchers to work on cures for viral outbreaks, and the worst thing of all, a floundering economy because everyone is afraid to go outside and is practicing social just a thing. Which isn't a cost-effective way to combat a virus. The most effective way it would be medical research to create vaccines. Are we really going to just shut down society every single time there's a virus? That's going to cost trillions upon trillions of dollars in commerce and ruin the economy. Where we could just invest that money instead in healthcare and medical research, and prevent the issue entirely in the future


The true cause of the viral outbreak was ineffective handling of the virus, first off. As soon as it was known, flights should have been shut down from the region in which the outbreak occurred. No matter how inconvenient it was. Then, scientists and medical researchers should have been flown into that region to try and work on a cure for it. the secondary cause of course was the fact that medical research is so weak across the world because people don't want to invest in it. We would rather have a two hundred billion-dollar soccer stadium or football stadium than to produce more hospitals",17,1584792679,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fme1hr/if_we_invest_more_in_healthcare_in_the_future_we/,Futurology,1

flbf0s,solidwhetstone,I am working on a solution to poverty. Details inside and AMA.,"Hi /r/futurology,

**TL;DR I have made a 3 minute video that goes into detail about the project here:** [**https://youtu.be/Du5D72jkVBQ**](https://youtu.be/Du5D72jkVBQ)

For a year and a half, I've been working on an idea that I hope can make an impact on global poverty. To put it as simply as possible: I have conceptualized a global human superintelligence network called The Hivenet, and a swarm intelligence game that pays you to play it called Voy. This will allow anyone in the world to monetize their own intelligence and make an income despite living in a depressed area or not having a job.

If you'd like to help the project succeed or get further detail on what exactly we're building, there's a lot of good info on the [**Project Voy Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/projectvoy). And once again, here is the video link: [**https://youtu.be/Du5D72jkVBQ**](https://youtu.be/Du5D72jkVBQ)

I'd love to answer any questions you have, and if you are interested in working on it with me, I look forward to hearing from you! Stay safe everyone.

fl74s3,_Flenser,How Viruses Mimic Human Behaviour,"A virus, as we all know, consumes its host. It makes safe harbor inside the host and begins to multiply and multiply at the host’s expense. Gradually, the host falls ill and weakens. Though the host has its own natural defenses against the virus, some viruses are strong enough to override such defenses. So, lacking medical intervention, the host dies, taking the virus with it. But the virus never intended to kill the host — that would be suicidal for the virus. Indeed, every dead host is a failing on the virus’ part. But the virus can’t help but consume its host. It is unable to reach an equilibrium with the host and doesn’t know how to coexist. In such circumstances, the only way for the virus to survive is by spreading to other hosts, thereby maximizing its chances for survival. 

There is another species on this planet that mimics the exact pattern of a virus: Human beings. See, human beings aren’t actually mammals. All mammals develop a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but human beings do not. We feast upon the Earth, taking more than we should, not knowing when to stop — indeed, not knowing *how* to stop. Consumption is our way of life. We used to survive by spreading to other areas but now, with globalization and free trade, we need not move. We’ve woven a web around our planets resources and gradually consume our host. Already, some of us are all too aware that the only way for our species to survive is by spreading to another planet, by finding new hosts. 

The Spanish Flu in 1918, one day, just disappeared. It stopped infecting new hosts. Was there any medical intervention that allowed human beings to guard against the virus? No. Did the virus simply die? Likely not. The virus must have radically altered its behaviour, mutated in some way, and found a way to coexist with the host. We stopped recognizing the virus because we were still looking for the symptoms it used to exhibit, but the virus had already become something completely different from what it was before. 

So, if there’s a lesson in all of this, it’s that humanity should aspire to be more like the Spanish Flu. Learn to coexist with the host. Find a way to live harmoniously with the surrounding environment. ",4,1584609565,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fl74s3/how_viruses_mimic_human_behaviour/,Futurology,1

fl3f8g,kernals12,The Post-Agriculture Era,"Farming has been the cornerstone of human life for 10,000 years. For most of that period, the vast majority of human labor went into the production of food. But just as hunting and gathering became obsolete, so too will agriculture. 

The first thing to go will be the raising of livestock. We are just a [few years away](https://www.treehugger.com/green-food/lab-grown-meat-one-step-closer-your-plate.html) from being able to buy lab grown meat and dairy at any Kroger's. Most of the world's farmland is dedicated one way or another to the raising of livestock, so that will get us most of the way to a post-agriculture period. The next step will be, by way of low cost solar power, the production of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins from coal, petroleum, or maybe even atmospheric carbon dioxide. With these, we can make all manner of processed food without any farming involved. And finally, there will be lab grown fruits and vegetables. 

The implications of this cannot be overstated. It will transform the lives of billions of people and bring modernity and urbanization to the undeveloped parts of the world. It will have enormous environmental benefits as farmland is returned to nature, rivers are no longer polluted with fertilizer runoff, and fisheries are no longer depleted. And most importantly, with food production being indifferent to drought, frost, and pests, our resilience to nature will greatly increase.",1,1584589880,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fl3f8g/the_postagriculture_era/,Futurology,1

fkog8q,Kami_leon,Post-Corona World," Hello world,

I wanted to share my thoughts on how I see the world post Coronavirus. Since the virus is incredibly contagious and has a high mortality rate, it will affect every community in the world causing massive healthcare problems. This will result in lockdowns and isolation for months (maybe longer) changing our lifestyles, habits and values. Here are the main changes to come: 

* No travel 
* no restaurants 
* no bars 
* no clubs 
* no large public gatherings (concerts, conferences, festivals, church services, sports events) 
* No public transport 
* No large office environments
* People watching a lot more youtube and Netflix 
* Social media becoming primary method of communication
* People working from home 
* Online education replacing traditional universities
* Government welfare for everyone in need 
* VR becoming more popular
* More people watching more often 
* Underground parties
* Back to farming (low scale)
* People forming distant communities (communes)
* A lot more hospitals and care centers   
   
And Most Importantly, **no more wars.** This is the first time in modern human history that we are faced with a common enemy thats not us! Governments will come together and use our collective military capacity to fight the virus and take care of people who are affected. This is a global problem and it will not be solved unless we come together and fight it as a single race. You wanted a silver lining, well, see above! 

Stay healthy and take care of each other,

fkls2g,Shir_Itzhak_Huber,i have discovered a way to gain immortality in 50-150 years and resurrect the dead in 150-600 years using technology," 

The Theory of Resurrection Using Technology in this post i will share with you a theory that will give humanity immortality within 50-150 years and resurrect the dead within 150-600 years 

“Those Who Dare Not Dream In The End Are Left With Nothing” - (a Quote by me Shir Itzhak Huber)

this theory will only happen if humanity manages to invent the technologies needed to make this theory a reality

Theory of immortality through Resurrection:

this theory is based on a phenomena where people see outside their body during surgery which i believe is their souls leaving and re entering their body.  
and how to use poison to make the soul of a dead person enter an artificial body effectively resurrecting him.  
this theory assumes souls are very small particles that remain where a person died until resurrected and link with the afterlife when they run out of life force before being resurrected.  
 

1. poisons: in order to resurrect the dead we need to obtain 2 poisons. the first Poison is a poison that I call soul removal poison.  
The soul of any person who is effected by this poison will leave the person’s body.  
The second poison we need is a poison I call soul absorption poison any soulless body that is effected by this person will absorb a nearby dead persons soul effectively reviving him.

2a. how to create the poisons: when a person goes through surgery sometimes he can see himself outside his body during the surgery.  
what I believe is happening is that his soul (a very small particle) left his body during the surgery and he can remember what his soul saw when it was outside his body when his soul is returned to his body.  
In order to create the soul removal poison we need to scan some patients brain during their surgeries and ask them if they had an out of body experience.  
Then we need to find the part of the brain that is normally working but stopped working during all of the surgeries where an out of body experience occurred.  
Then we need to create a poison that disables that part of the brain.  
To create the soul absorption poison we merely need to restore function to the part of the brain the soul removal poison disables.

2b. what to do if the soul absorption poison doesn't work:  
if the soul absorption poison doesn't work we need to find when an out of body experience ends.  
in order to find when an out of body experience ends precisely:  
there should be a change in brain activity from when the body is without a soul to when it has one and if we can find parts of the brain that are inactive before this change and are active after we can try and do Resurrection trials with re activating each of them along with the part of the brain that is responsible for keeping our soul inside our body until we find the part that is responsible for soul absorption   

2c. If I am correct using the 2 poisons together will cause the brain of an artificial body to absorb a dead man’s soul instead of a babies soul (resurrect rather then create a grown baby).

2d. the resurrection experiment:  
in order to prove the dead can be resurrected we will need to perform the following experiment.  
we put a stem cell body in a hospital whenever an organ donor that agrees to the experiment is undergoing low survival surgery.  
a stem cell body will be put in the corner of the surgery room.  
if the person dies the first organ to be removed will be the brain and it will be burned at the room to insure the person died in.  
after the brain is burned the stem cell body will be injected with the soul absorption poison and something to disable the soul removal poison.  
then we wait a few hours and see if the stem cell body gains consciousness.   
if it does we monitor it for a year and see if he regains his (the dead person's) memories on his own.  
if after a year he doesn't regain his memories (or shows any sign of being an adult and not a baby) we inject him with memory restoring medicine (if there will be a cure for Alzheimer's inject him with that and any other similar cure ) treat him as if he has Alzheimer's  
if by the age of 3 (from being resurrected) he doesn't regain his memories try and send him to a special school for the stem cell resurrected . if he doesn't grow up like a normal kid by the age of 5-7 (can't talk for example) (from being resurrected) then there is a defect in the stem cell body that is preventing him from regaining his memories and we need to improve the stem cell bodies before trying again  

2e. the experiment of resurrection will need to be carried out on thousands of volunteers at once each time to insure accuracy and speed up the resurrection    

3.why use stem cell bodies: we need to ensure the body we resurrect the dead to will not have a soul of its own. not when its created and not after.  
stem cell body can be created with no souls.  
if we poison the stem cell body with a soul removing poison before we finish printing it won't get its own soul.    
then when we want to resurrect the dead we replace the soul removing poison with a    
soul absorbing poison causing the stem cell body to resurrect the nearest dead soul  
there may be more steps but that's the basics of it

4. how to create the stem cell body:  
we print an entire human body using stem cells to create everything from blood to organs to bones using a 3d printer

5. resurrect long dead: I believe if a person is dead for too long his soul won’t be capable of being absorbed into a stem cell body (can’t be resurrected) without restoring its energy.  
We will need to figure out how the human brain charges the soul with energy I have a few guesses.

5a. emotions: if this is the case if we can figure a way to transmit human emotions into the air (hook a stimulated heart to a portable machine maybe).

5b. brain energy: I have a theory that when the humans sleep their brain recharges their souls with life energy if we hook up a brain to a machine that can extract this energy into the air we can use it to recharge dead souls and resurrect the long dead into stem cell bodies.

6. the inventions necessary to make this theory a reality have not yet been invented and would likely be invented by someone other then me. this theory is like a blueprint the four theories in it are the parts necessary to  make it a reality 

the four parts are:   
1. stem cell body  
2. soul removal poison  
3. soul absorption poison  
4. find out what energy our soul runs on and how to distribute it into the air (into souls that where dead for more then a certain time)

(only the first 3 parts are necessary for immortality part number 4 is necessary for resurrection and i predict it will take the longest to get)

Some countries may require a regular reading of you for example. Or all citizens could be required to have a test done during an outbreak.

It could be that we have legislation in place that requires the infected person to self isolate, with that time out being paid for or not depending on the country.

It could be that we don't require vaccinations at a population level anymore, except for high R.0 diseases such as measles. Though that wouldn't be required if we have tests that are very low imposition and as such clamp down on disease will before they are transmissible.

There will be countries that meet the higher criteria but anyone wanting to enter transport systemd such as airports in less developed countries will have to go thru that screening prior to entry.

fk8sd9,solidwhetstone,Monetizing Wisdom: A Solution to the Economic Downturn,"Odds are good that either you or someone close to you are hurting financially. This could be due to the recent Coronavirus outbreak, or perhaps your job was a casualty of the Automation Revolution. However you got here, you're here. This article is for you.

Around the world, [77% of people live in some form of multidimensional poverty](http://hdr.undp.org/en/2018-MPI). Many are the victims of climate change—recently homeless due to drought, wildfires, and political unrest. Many have simply been born into poor conditions. Many live in areas that were once prosperous, but have become depressed for a variety of reasons.

People living in poverty have an abundance of untapped wisdom. A young man named Yusuff in Sierra Leone barely earns [$5 per day](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/17/nearly-half-the-world-lives-on-less-than-550-a-day), but he has a wealth of knowledge on football. Fatima in Afghanistan works 3 jobs to earn enough to feed her son, but she has a passion for chemistry and hopes to someday put her knowledge to use and finish her masters.

All around the world, men and women are struggling to get by, yet they harbor untold riches—facts and figures, intuitions, feelings, passions, and experiences. They are writers and thinkers, passionate creators and geeks. They're sports fans, film buffs, musicians, technicians, and artists. But an immeasurable amount of their knowledge, wisdom, and intellectual skill goes unshared. Their path is one of suffering, trapped within the harsh realities of poverty.

## Introducing a Different Way of Thinking

Imagine a different kind of world with me. In this world, every human is an entrepreneur. In this world, every person has a phone with internet, and they use it to monetize their own knowledge on everything from news and sports to theoretical physics and biology. Everything anyone knows is shared with the wider world, and each individual is paid for their contribution.

What might such a network allow us to accomplish? Researchers merge their minds into hives of activity—breaking down the hardest problems in minutes. Scientists seeking cures get the very best information from the world's brightest minds. Students learn from those in the field. Information flows freely and anonymously with no regard to status or class. Car mechanics ask questions and CEOs provide the answers. Everyone and everything they know is valued by someone.

A network like this is the solution we've been looking for—the solution to automation replacing our jobs, and depressions destroying our business prospects. A human superintelligence network comprised of hiveminds. A Hivenet.

## It's 2027. This is Ian.

Ian is an Australian refugee from a wildfire that burned up his home. The surrounding towns have become depressed and Ian is having trouble finding a job while he looks for a new place to live. Luckily he still has his smartphone and can get online when he finds free internet hotspots.

At a coffee shop along the way, Ian encounters another refugee named Fiona. Fiona is using a phone app to earn an income while she travels. It provides enough income to improve her life. She gets a notification and offers to show Ian how it works.

She plays a short multiplayer game with a group of people who share her interest in ecology. The group puts their minds together and comes up with a good answer to a question about how the recent outbreak in wildfires might impact the local ecology. The game ends, and Fiona is rewarded.

She explains that she just got paid for the answer she helped with, and she would also earn residual income as the answer is bought and used by others in the future. By playing this game every day, she is creating numerous new streams of income. Ian decides to download the app and give it a try.

Within a day, he has answered three questions and is earning money. Within a week, he has answered all kinds of questions based on his interests and skills. He’s earned enough to start making a noticeable improvement to his quality of life, and he feels like this simple game is helping him make a difference in the world.  


The year isn’t 2027. It’s 2020, but this could be our future.

fk4het,charles_marlow_,Is there any existing survival social network ?," 

Hi guys,

Sorry for my english it's not my mother tongue.

I was wondering if there is any application / social network whose purpose is to organize people's goods/production/abilities. Let's say John is living near James (their proximity is known because of the GPS device of the app). John has 100 kg of rice and also a garden where he grew potatoes. So, John has goods (rice), a production of potatoes and an ability (gardening). Now, in time of crisis (or pre-crisis), he meets James via the app. James has also some stock of goods, a production (chicken coop let's say) and he is a doctor in his daily life (so it's his ability).

The idea is to pre-organize small community. The geolocation is a big plus. If there is an inventory device in the app, we could see in a specific and close area a system of a common stock ( John trade with James his surplus without any exchange of money, just barter). Also everyone could count one the abilities and production of others. You don't have to grew vegetable if you don't have the ground or the ability.

Also, one big plus is to avoid any panic reaction like we can see in our days. If you know that one your neighbour (the geolocation is not too precise in order to avoid theft) has *x* stock of something, you can avoid the shortage fear.

Finally, even without any crisis, this app would be an alternative to the actual state and big compagny's control of our economic life.

I know that some communities are already living like that (or trying) but my question is about the existence of an app/network that would ease this task ? And if not, what do you thing about the utility of creating one ?",0,1584448521,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fk4het/is_there_any_existing_survival_social_network/,Futurology,1

fjzwzm,samtart,The NBA should finish the season in ESports," We are facing two dangers, the virus &amp; economic slowdown.

We should not run from one into the other. We should do everything we can to adapt and continue as much economic activity as possible.

One way for the NBA to lead the way is for players to finish the season using live streamed (ESPN also) NBA video games.

This will get peoples minds of the virus, show people we can adapt, and will spur some much needed economic activity.

As far as adapting all the sports should do the same but it goes way beyond that.

Education, Work, Entertainment, shopping, and especially home improvement can provide many opportunities to continue economic activity even under quarantine.

For example for people living in single family homes they can continue to spend money on home improvement projects like water harvesting, indoor farming, small scale solar, and more.

Restaurants should stay open and provide carry out and delivery as much as possible.

The government wants to pump money into the economy including into peoples hands but if there is no way for them to spend it then it is useless. We must find ways for people to be productive and economically active during this crisis period.

I would like to hear your creative/crazy ideas as to how people can adapt and contribute to economic activity and restoration of normal activities through this disruptive period.",6,1584423500,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fjzwzm/the_nba_should_finish_the_season_in_esports/,Futurology,1

fjxjsu,mcatoen,We made a mailing list for those interested in the future of ethical alternatives,"##TL:DR
Studies show that 90% of people prefer ethical brands when they shop. So why are these brands not taking over? Well, they simply can't get noticed when the rest of the world is spending $280B annually for your attention. My friends, colleagues, and I have started a mailing list at https://gethonest.co for anyone who wants to learn about recent, realistic alternatives to the products they use. 

##My background
I've been working on a tech startup in market research for a few months and have gotten to know the advertising and consumer research process for massive brands intimately (P&amp;G, Unilever, RB, etc). During that journey, a few employees and friends started emailing each other when they found companies making ethical and environmental alternatives to these name brands. Personally, I was fascinated at the kinds of things we were finding. It’s about time we expand this community to you guys. We’re starting with a mailing list which you can join at https://gethonest.co.

##The kind of stuff we share
We prefer a practical over a hardline approach to improving our consumption. We like products that are realistic alternatives to the goods we already consume (they have to be just as awesome). We focus on the ethically and environmentally sustainable, prioritizing fair wages and human rights. For example, I love this company we found which makes shoes out of pineapple waste. They're this young bunch of Kenyan entrepreneurs and the shoes look great. Sort of like a pineapple textile Allbirds.

##Aren't there loads of blogs and sites that already do this?
Weekly mailing lists are a super digestible way to expose brands that make the world a better place. - A lot of sustainability advice is really impractical. Nobody is going to start going without or making their own shoes, but we can choose to buy from companies that align with our values. We try to help the majority of people who are only starting consuming ethically. - We have a much bigger vision - we want to build a community that supports sustainability in a way that’s accessible and practical, starting with a mailing list and going beyond!

##How do we pick what goes into the digest?
It's pretty ad-hoc right now, but we try to focus on great products, sustainability, and fairly obscure brands most people wouldn't have heard of themselves. We're also always looking for suggestions from communities like these, so PLEASE reach out if you're aware of any companies that must go in our digest.",20,1584412562,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fjxjsu/we_made_a_mailing_list_for_those_interested_in/,Futurology,0

fjwylj,jdrch,"COVID-19 &amp; its implications for the survivability of future space travel, habitation, and colonization","# TL,DR: social distancing is likely to be impossible even in advanced colonies and spacecraft far into the future. Anything with COVID-19's characteristics might rapidly wipe out crew, residents, etc.

So this one's probably *really* far into the future, but I thought about it yesterday.

Even if advance tech gives us fusion powered plasma rocket engines and the like, future spacecraft and colonies are likely to be largely confined spaces with very little facility for quarantine.

You may wonder how such a pathogen would get aboard in the first place. Well first of all, it might not be something we screen for, or it could have a long incubation time, as COVID-19 does. We could launch an infected astronaut who could spread the disease to the entire crew after they left orbit. It could also be in the supplies themselves. 

Consider a manned resupply ship on which that happens. The distant colony can't do without the resupplies, and crew dies *en route*. The ship can still land at its destination; it'll just be a hot zone. What does the colony decide? What if they decide to take the shipment and then one of the colonists gets sick? Do they even bother to treat that person or send them out an airlock for the good of everyone else?

fjkscd,slip-6,"It turns out that a single, unified threat to every nation on Earth is not necessarily good for the economy after all."," 

Anyone  who has taken a college level economics course in the U.S. tradition  has had it explained to them that the entire world economy would benefit  greatly from a good war with extra-terrestrials. Sure, lots of people  would die, it is explained. But if everyone were fighting the same  enemy, this would require unprecedented levels of production and  organization that would dramatically reduce unemployment, increase  spending and raise GDP all over the world.

So,  it's 2020, and the whole world is now facing a unified threat which can  only be soundly defeated with substantial cooperation from roughly  every human being on the planet. Sure, we've faced disease before, but  nothing that spread like this, and never with the possibility to so  rapidly organize responses at such a minute level over such great  distances and across such deep communicative obstacles. This is as close  to an alien invasion as we are likely to get with the Fermi Paradox  being what it is. So, how's the economy doing?

By  any standard which the above-mentioned school of economics would  recognize, it's in the trash, and there's no doubt that the execution of  the sensible social response to our unified threat is to blame. Those  people most heavily invested in the stock market are the ones most  likely to lie and say that the threat does not exist. Because what this  crisis demands of every human being on the planet is that they stay home  and refrain from over-consumption and spectacle. This is the threat  beyond the imagination of an American economist; the kind that can't be  solved by increasing the overall rate of circulation of goods and  services.

Perhaps  it will be objected to that this is not a war, but as a thought  experiment, imagine that you learned that there is a secret society of  extra-terrestrial invaders just beyond the solar system, far beyond the  reach of any rocket, and that diseases of the kind from which we are all  now taking shelter is their method of clearing us out. Would that  information change anything about the proper social response or the  effect of that response on the economy? Very well then. we might as well  be at war with extra-terrestrials.

It's  appropriate, really. It seems we may just get what we need: a great  global challenge of the kind we self-organizing primates fantasize  about, but one that demands that we actually behave sensibly toward the  planet at the expense of the so-called economy.",29,1584364618,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fjkscd/it_turns_out_that_a_single_unified_threat_to/,Futurology,1

fjhwfh,MercuriusExMachina,Avoiding a global economy collapse due to the Coronavirus pandemic,"Please, we really need to start having this hard conversation -- it's exactly what this sub is for, as opposed to posting Elon Musk news.

I start by quoting pandemic expert Francois Balloux:

&gt; There is no such thing as a choice between managing the pandemic vs. protecting the economy.

&gt; Health and the economy are closely linked. The correlation between per-capita GDP and health (life expectancy) is essentially perfect. 

&gt; If the covid-19 pandemic leads to a global economy collapse, **many more lives will be lost than covid-19 would ever be able to claim**.

You can find him on Twitter.

Even in countries where it's really bad, like Italy, and most intense measures are being taken, there is still +20% per day.

The same holds true for Australia -- what this means is that there is next to none seasonal variation.

+20% may not sound like much, but it amounts to a 3-day doubling rate, which might again not sound like much, but it amounts to a 100 fold increase per month.

What this means is that in 3 months all the world population will be infected (no vaccine can come this soon), even with the economy mostly shut down, like in Italy.

Regarding vaccination, I continue by quoting Francois again:

&gt; How long immunity lasts for following covid-19 infection is the biggest unknown. **Comparison with other Coronaviridae suggests it may be relatively short-lived (i.e. months)**. If this were to be confirmed, it would add to the challenge of managing the pandemic.

&gt; Short-lived immunisation would defeat both ‘flattening the curve’ and ‘herd immunity’ approaches. Devising an effective strategy would be even more challenging under low seasonal forcing. It would also considerably complicate effective vaccination campaigns.

So, the question is not whether or not massive die-off can be avoided due to the pandemic (it can't), but whether or not massive die-off can be avoided due to a global economic collapse (it can).

The hard decision the politicians will need to take is not to shut down the economy to but to **keep it running despite the pandemic**.

Please take this perspective into consideration.",25,1584348825,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fjhwfh/avoiding_a_global_economy_collapse_due_to_the/,Futurology,1

The latter idea rests on concepts of the past that manifests themselves in the today. **However, what if one could reverse this idea and evoke a similar spectre but from the future to the today?** Futurists, of course, have explored a similar topic quite thoroughly but I think it always portrayed the the future as something mythical, dystopian, which was consumed as fiction/fantasy.

I argue that the future has come upon the humanity faster than anyone could expect. Several processes are already in action and I believe the next few decades will bring major changes. The fear of the near tomorrow, though, is a powerful human experience that could be explored through arts. I would like to capitalize on this emotion and bring about an experience that would be direct and provocative. I think of it as waking from a deep sleep to find out that something more haunting than the nightmare itself is awaiting.

fiv12x,kernals12,Are We Just Fickle About Population Growth?,"On February 26, 1972, The New York Times published the [following editorial:](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/26/archives/toward-zero-growth.html)

&gt;Toward Zero Growth?  
&gt;  
&gt;A sharp and sudden drop in the child‐bearing expectations of young wives offers some hope —though no assurance—that the United States may be able to stabilize its population in time to avoid seriously endangering what is left of the American environment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Census Bureau reports that the number of children expected by wives aged 18 to 24 dropped precipitously from 2.9 in 1967 to 2.4 last year, a rate approaching the level that would result in zero population growth. If the current rate persists, it would mean 25 million fewer Americans by the year 2000 ‐280 million instead of the previously projected 305 million.  
&gt;  
&gt;That would still represent a very substantial increase (about one‐third) over the present population of approximately 208 million, one that would place a heavy burden on resources even without the continuing improvement in living standards that Americans have come to take for granted. And there is no assurance that the present trend toward smaller family preferences can be maintained. Some reasons cited for the recent change are transient, such as the economic slump and a temporary shortage of eligible husbands.  
&gt;  
&gt;But there are encouraging, more enduring factors behind the new birth expectation statistics. The decrease reflects in some degree the success of new contraception techniques and the spread of family planning information, spurred by the pioneering Family Planning Act of 1970. And there is considerable non‐statistical evidence that the young people of this country are increasingly awake to the environmental consequences of unchecked population growth; that they are taking seriously the social and personal responsibilities of parenthood.  
&gt;  
&gt;The census study offers no grounds for complacency but it does suggest that the long‐time efforts of environmentalists and family planning advocates may be beginning to take hold.

Oh how elite opinions have changed. Nowadays you'd be hard pressed not to find an article warning that America and pretty much every developed country is facing a crisis from the end of population growth, to be rectified by more immigrants or encouraging more babies. 

This obsession recently reached absurd heights when the same Newspaper that published the above editorial nearly 50 years ago published this article

[China's Birthrate Hits Historic Low, in Looming Crisis for Beijing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/china-birth-rate-2019.html)

This has me thinking that what we have is a simple case of ""the grass is always greener on the other side"". A big reason is that a lot of these intellectuals, many who work for think tanks, others who are published authors or activists, need there to be problems, because then they can be paid to suggest ways to fix it. And obviously, the news media thrives on bad news. So sometimes they'll just make up problems. 

If we ever have another baby boom, I'm sure they'll go straight back to calling for ZPG (the old acronym for Zero Population Growth).",12,1584242617,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fiv12x/are_we_just_fickle_about_population_growth/,Futurology,1

* There will be massive, often permanent shifts in habits as more people get used to working from home. If working from home maintains itself as something desirable to both employers and employees, this could become the new normal once the pandemic passes.

* Greater demand for delivery apps. With less focus on going out, more people will get used to having food and groceries delivered to them. Restaurants and markets will have to adapt to allow for these sorts of things in the first place.

* Vastly accelerated roll out of automation. With an economic downturn looming, businesses will have an opportunity to experiment with automation in the coming months and years.

&amp;#x200B;

That's FOR EVERYONE

CARE

Why are you doing Anything? anything you do you do because you care:

example you want money to sustain yourself or you wanna have good a good time or feel safe , why? because you care about yourself.

the difference between an animal and an intelligent being is they can consciously and knowingly care about things

while animals care for simpler reasons like their own survival and not much else or/and do it without the awareness to know that is what they are doing. every being doing everything and anything for/ summed Care(I m being literal not a metaphor).

&amp;#x200B;



GOOD/BAD AND RESULT     

CARING POSITEVELY

GOOD

care untwisted and simple is the good and it never really collides with other people care and when you think it does just think how that situation is actually an extortion that you do not like being inflicted on and how it as instigated by someone who said i nothing(i do not care) yet still managed to do something miraculously

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

VOID   LORDS

BAD

now since everyone doing anything cause of care how bad things happen? very easily since they are not being caring positively when you say example i only care about money ,you do not care about plastic paper, you care about you so you wanna have safety or fun or this or that but you skip the part that that is not necessarily true and even if it is, its circomstantial, someone like you made it to be so to begin with, not absolute

and how things can be so twisted? well every single one of the people that made or done something bad they always 

say internally if not also externally that they do not care about him/her/them etc..

now what is do not care? its nothing so every time someone says do not care you should replace the word with nothing,

so think the meaning of the those various thoughts and sentences and the validity of saying nothing

i wont give you examples for both valid and not valid someone else would be better at that but some times if asked about something

a valid response is nothing but when someone was doing something bad nothing is never a valid one, not only that it also does not make sense like the following example

you did this so you can make money even though so many people got hurt                                   response   i do not care about them they are dumb                  

so basically    

i nothing.      and also what they add after nothing is irrelevant

=so basically 0 sense          

RESULT=MADNESS

&amp;#x200B;



Madness hiding word number...something:

Hypocrisy 

is actually Madness in disguise despite the given definition hypocrisy is not being used when someone lies about his character or image but rather its being used when someone is lying to themselves and by extension to others. everyone is using it unconsciously to justify and legitimize double think, double think is when you tell yourself one thing when it does not suit you then tell yourself another when it does, which is basically madness ,hypocrisy is the word made for to cover that fact up:

hypocrite is an empty word to hide the belief of 2 conflicting ideas that contradict each other, basically madness, also its more of wanting to keep both beliefs at the same time even though you know they do not add up



THE MODULE OF WILL/WANT/PROOF OF BEING and the free part 

Will and Want both are proof of existence but both so originate from Care and are varying reactions to it simply put so the module is Care 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Free Will: the free part is a whitewash

all it matters is that you have care whether in the form of desires or dreams ,passively along those lines or 

actively doing something, free will means doing whatever you want which is impossible either 

by limitations or even more so by definition since even if you had no limitations anywhere defining things means

also limiting them in a box, even by saying I you limit yourself to define you so that means free will is an 

impossibility and its been used to justify that for example that since prisoners have no free will thus are non 

existent even though the only way that happens is by surrendering your will willingly whether its temporary or 

more long term surrender of will through some kind of sale, and that is still only simply till you decide otherwise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About LOVE, Adoration and Hate

WHAT IS LOVE?

love is caring a lot , deeply , etc..

naturally everyone loves themselves but you can love others also

it can be love of self or someone else not by definition but by usage

love for yourself is self explanatory ,by usage its actually caring a lot for or by someone else even though people try to confuse things because they do not want to really answer or get an answer for that

&amp;#x200B;

adoration

when you say i love this dress basically that is not love that is like a lot,

example: i like this shoes then you go to :i like this shoes a lot then its not i love ,

=its i adore those shoes,

not love but it is out of love of yourself

&amp;#x200B;

hate

hate is dislike a lot, not the opposite of love but the opposite of adoration , so people can pretend they are positive forces to basically sell what they like or shun what they dislike 

&amp;#x200B;

care a lot=love

like a lot=adore 

dislike a lot=hate

not caring=nothing(emptiness)  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

INFERIOR/SUPERRIOR EFFECT

Inferior

What is Jealousy?

you tell yourself someone is better than you and since you cant really accept it u hurting from all that denial, that they call jealous

&amp;#x200B;

What is Envy?

envy is when someone reacts aggressively to the butthurt from the denial mentioned above

aside from the above there are other reactions also as

&amp;#x200B;

admitting it: yes i am jealous but i admit it so i am not in denial

&amp;#x200B;

now switch jealousy with denial on the above sentence and you get:

&amp;#x200B;

yes i am in denial but i admit it so i am not in denial  = LOL

&amp;#x200B;

Superior

basically when you think others with your nonsense measuring of things naturally your brain will put a fire on your ass when your measuring do not suit you(when you care),whatever your: you are better than others also applies to you being inferior. someone might feel sorry for you and spare your feelings but our own brains clearly do not thus denial which they call jealousy or envy ( jealousy+ aggression ) so they can admit it and/or so they can attack you with it

also there is no we in BEST



RESULT

Impossible to be superior but not get the denial that was mentioned above unless you are completely delusional thus thinking of yourself the absolute one: best of all time and for all time blah blah blewx

so instead of winners 98% of the population of Earth is mental,2% thinks its cultural thing and also there is me being weird

Main point: Every possible situation and instance of someone‘s actions can be summed up and is care, the difference is you have to be caring positively and when i say that i do not mean mannerism or attitude but rather if you go to the root of all reasons, actions and desires there is care but also the bad part where someone said do not care which is :nothing and like im trying to explain on this paper :every single instance some wrong due to someone’s actions happened they used the word nothing(don’t care) in an invalid way in their thinking                                                                                                     MARIOS YOU KNOW WHO",3,1584176478,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fifkyr/infinity_everyones_god_of_both_real_and_imagined/,Futurology,1

Join SPY GANG and chat to the homies..

I started trading stocks in 2018 and while researching buying opportunities i started a discord server to keep track of live events.

With over 1200 members many of us make a comfortable living managing risk and monitoring value in the financial industry.

Most of us work from home using free brokerages to facilitate trades thru the internet.

More recently many large brokerages abolished commissions for trades so it can cost $0 to sign up.

Much of this is also associated with economics, mathematics and statistical probability so there is many practical uses for the things you will learn along the way even if you don't put money into the market we welcome all kinds of people who are interested in what we do.

My server will always be free to use and a great place to get news alerts, stock prices, trading information and a ton of fresh content.

ficj27,3k_bdlk,Do you believe creativity can change the world? Here is why I do.,"Much is said about how much technology evolves and becomes more powerful. But there is something in which no artificial intelligence is yet capable of replacing the human being: creativity. Here are some examples. What do you think about it?

[**A little fish that changed the health of a country.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMsN8fUuncI)

The lack of iron in the diet of people in Cambodia caused several health problems, from lack of attention at school to developmental problems in the body. But finding a cheap way to make iron accessible to everyone was not enough. It was necessary to make this part of the local culture.

&amp;#x200B;

[**The crayons that teach children to wash their hands.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MobYmmNxlI)

In India, where many people eat with their hands, this habit ends up being a problem for the health of children, who do not always use soap when washing. So, the soap became an ingredient of something that children use in their daily lives in schools. Simple, cheap and very efficient.

&amp;#x200B;

[**Hacking Instagram to fight human trafficking.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sothlpxa6V0)

Those who disappeared are not always close to where they were last seen. In cases such as human trafficking, these people may be in other regions or even continents. Thinking about it, Impar (Instituto Ana Paula Moreno) decided to invade the hashtags of global events to find hope for missing people. Amazing, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

[**The first carbon-free fashion collection.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P3yeZFsYQU)

No fashionista wants to be seen twice with the same look on social media. But how can we be consistent with environmental causes if consumption continues to grow? With a collection created exclusively for digital photos.

&amp;#x200B;

[**A fee to give nature the future it deserves.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WNL6wAjW-Y)

Civilization has always taken advantage of nature to feed the market. But he never returned it. For this reason, a small fee was adopted by large companies that aims to contribute to the positive impact on the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

[**The visa is also a liability term.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4DVbTeMkog)

When entering countries full of natural beauty, not all tourists are as careful as they should be. But that stamp on the document arrived to prevent them from getting off the line. Simple, but brilliant.

&amp;#x200B;

[**A country created to draw attention to what the world does not see.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/G4DVbTeMkog)

The islands of garbage are already bigger than many of the countries that exist in the world. Even so, nobody comments on how great the impact of our wastes on the environment is. Then, a country came up specially to demonstrate this.

fhywyk,FloppyGrandmaTitties,Viral outbreaks are the greatest threat to our survival in the future since most of the world has invested so little into healthcare,"No one could have possibly predicted that the coronavirus could wreak havoc on the economy, and on society like it has. Businesses are ordering their offices to shut down, people to work remote, theme parks shutting down. Supermarkets are completely out of essential resources for survival. People are flocking to supermarkets to drain them of essential resources (and ironically exposing themselves to the virus). But worst of all is the healthcare cost of the virus, and the difficulty in treating it. There's no cure at all for a viral outbreak. Process that for a moment. No cure. None. sure you can make a vaccine. But that's not 100% effective, and it takes a lot of time and energy. Even worse is healthcare. Most of the nation can't afford the test (1-2k$ to test for coronavirus) let alone the treatment. It could cost upwards of 3000$ WITH INSURANCE!! This is for one single virus that isn't too dissimilar to the flu, and it's causing widespread fear chaos panic....


In the future, viral outbreaks are our biggest threat because viruses are constantly evolving, there are new ones every few years, there aren't enough medical personnel to address an outbreak, and worst of all... No developed country has the resources to handle an outbreak effectively. None. Even free healthcare countries don't because there aren't enough medical personnel!!

fhe7ka,redcement,The Spring of 2020 (Coronavirus),"(for my children and for all of you as well, in the midst of Coronavirus)

You will say these things, many years from now.

In the Spring of 2020, I experienced myself as a resilient person.

In the Spring of 2020, everything changed. The world was more terrifying and more deeply sympathetic than I ever could have predicted. 

In the Spring of 2020, where were you? When did it hit you that nothing would ever be like it was before?

In the Spring of 2020, my prediction that I would be a success, exempt from the threat of pending climate disaster and global poverty because of my intellect, my stamina, my creativity, and my desire to capture the world; that prediction became a whisper from the past, then an echo, and then it was still.

In the Spring in 2020, all our dreams were stolen. We had to wake up. It didn’t so much hurt; as we didn’t know what anything meant, for a while. 

Then — because of our stolen dreams, our heavy losses, our shattered confidence, our confusion and our fear— we found we had to become a whole community, deeply in need of one another. We became aware of suffering and we were given the gift of knowing suddenly everything we needed to, about extending ourselves skillfully to one another.

It was the Spring of 2020. We were the lucky ones who got to live through it. We become The Valiant Generation.

fh8swe,kernals12,Prophets of Doom Suffer From a Lack of Imagination,"Throughout history, individuals have foretold future disaster for humanity and have been wrong time and again. What they ultimately suffer from is a lack of imagination.   


Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the standard of living for any place was stuck at some low equilibrium because as prosperity increased, population also did, which then outstripped the food supply leading conditions back to square one. He was writing in the late 18th century and saw that living standards had scarcely increased for millennia so he had much reason for his view. He did not anticipate the industrial revolution that completely turned his iron laws on their head.

Let us now zoom ahead to 1968 when Paul Ehrlich published *The Population Bomb*, predicting that the earth's unprecedented population growth, which at the time was such that the world's population was doubling every 30 years, would lead to disaster. He predicted millions of deaths from malnutrition in the developed world in the 70s and 80s. He called on the US to cut off aid to countries that didn't implement stringent family planning and at one point floated the idea of lacing water supplies with contraceptives. While Ehrlich was preaching doom, a man named Norman Borlaug was revolutionizing third world agriculture and staved off the disaster Ehrlich foretold. This Green Revolution was something Ehrlich slapped down explicitly, thinking it was impossible in any way for earth to support so many people.

At around the same time, a ton of intellectuals, Ehrlich included, claimed that the earth could not support the ever increasing affluence of the First world and that economic growth need to be halted or even reversed. They had many good reasons to think so. Southern California was choking on automobile exhaust fumes, Lake Erie had been poisoned by raw sewage and industrial effluent, the Bald Eagle was being driven to extinction by DDT, refrigerants were thinning the ozone layer, and the Adirondacks were being pelted with acid rain. But we managed to find technological solutions for almost all of these problems (DDT being the exception, we just banned it) and 50 years later, despite a tremendous increase in living standards, environmental conditions have improved dramatically. These people could not imagine that urban pollution could be solved simply by strapping a bunch of catalysts to car exhausts or that we could find refrigerants that didn't destroy the ozone layer.

In 2020, we face yet more prophecies of doom. We're told that climate change will wipe out agriculture, send mosquitoes into places that they haven't been before, create deadlier hurricanes, flood our coasts, and cause millions of Indians to die from deadly heatwaves and our only way out is to substantially inconvenience ourselves by giving up cars and planes and not eating meat. And once again they are going to be wrong, with their lack of imagination being their undoing.",88,1583978360,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fh8swe/prophets_of_doom_suffer_from_a_lack_of_imagination/,Futurology,1

Then it hit me. Online advertising relies on the ability to target users in specific countries, regions or even localities. The vast majority of advertisers need to be able to geographically target their ads, but VPNs subvert that.

loads of changes. significant change is that it market orders 1/10 of the amount if pos &gt;350 &lt;-350, every interval, and adjusts the 1/10 mark to achieve a consistent 75% maker volume.

This lessens the overall risk and allows for a higher pos\_lim\_long &amp; short.

The more we can keep delta neutral, the less we have to worry about significant moves.

How's the bot been running for you? Are you my ref also running eth?

We might also want to kill march futures (by default on btc on repo, just remove 'btc-' from 'btc-mar20' and it'll also kill eth mar fut) because we're close to expiry.

SLs now reduce to delta neutral, instead of marketing out the entire position. This is extremely helpful in not losing a whole bunch of $ on SL, meaning we can SL more often.

We’re increasing our market maker first to $5k balance next week on a separate account, next pilot will be $150-$300k and then our first round of funding will be \~$50m (which should be a significant amount Deribit but also diversified a bit).

We’re wondering if we could negotiate a preferred fee rebate on top of the standard offer, to provide this kind of liquidity? Even a slight improvement on rebate would be exponential for us.

&amp;#x200B;

The bot checks funding rates on Deribit among perpetual and futures, and longs whichever pays the other. When longing or shorting perp and shorting or longing futures, it 4x the longs on perp in ordersize so that — effectually — at any point it should be near 0 total position. This effects a situation where upwards or downwards movement in market doesn’t affect the returns, and you effectively collect on fees + the convergence of your perp and futures in cash n carry arbitrage + the spread.

fgn82u,SelectRow4,Restaurant of the future,"Have you guys noticed that :
eating out is very difficult and expensive.


in an area, typically,

You might find an outlet selling pizza or burger, 
you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

Do you see the difference now ?

Native advertising is a form of paid content that is displayed in a form similar to the content in the media and the placement area; both in terms of layout, design, and even the type of font used. In essence, native advertising content looks and functions like a natural part of related media.

Native Ad does have several advantages. One of them, it is more difficult to be blocked by ads-blocker features or applications, so that native ads are easier to ""meet"" the target [audience.](https://analisa.io/)

Here’s how to excel on Native Advertising

**1. Create The Right Content**

The next step is to create the right content as a native ad campaign material to rebuild a positive image. The native ads campaign is like propaganda. The battlefield is the hearts and minds of consumers and the general public. In this context, the opposite party is a negative image that is already owned by a brand.

Victory on the battlefield is a positive brand image in the eyes of consumers and the general public. Proof can be done by describing data, facts, information, opinions, and testimonies from parties considered neutral, and so on through content that is used as native ads campaign material.

**2. Use Expert’s Opinion**

If possible, experts who relate between their fields of science and the industrial sector of the brand owner, their opinions and testimonies can be used to fill native ads campaign content. Of course, the experts chosen must also be known by consumers and the general public. 

**3. Perform Native Ads Campaigns Appropriately**

After the material contents for the native ads campaign are finished producing, the next step is to start the campaign. The selection of the type of digital media used to carry out the campaign must be precise, namely the digital media used by the majority of consumers or their target market.

The longer the period of the campaign, and the more often the content of the content is seen by the same individual, the better it is. Psychologically it is necessary to see or read, or listen to the same content several times so that a human being can remember it well in the conscious and unconscious mind. 

**4. More Active To** [**Audiences**](https://analisa.io/) 

Native Advertising separates the brain science behind this adequacy, featuring the degree of personalization per users’ involvement in intelligent substance. Also, they notice the feeling of having a place and network that intuitive substance can bring. The intuitive substance is drawing in, and when done right, it can likewise produce informal outcomes.

**5. Expand More Targets By Retargeting**

Retargeting, focusing on individuals who have just demonstrated enthusiasm for your item and are in this manner bound to change over, is getting progressively well known. 4 out of 5 clients notice retargeted advertisements, and retargeting promotions are 75% bound to get clicks than customary showcase advertisements. Get saw, and get saw adequately.

Native advertising can be a significant piece of your general advertising technique, particularly when it's as supported substance. It can allow you to get innovative. Drawing in your peruses with first-rate content forms positive emotions about your image and prompts brand reliability, which is hard to obtain. At the point when it's set appropriately, your potential purchasers won't consider it to be an interference.",1,1583841325,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fgcn75/what_is_native_advertising_and_how_to_excel_it/,Futurology,1

The funding could be spent in two stages; research and development into the brain which is being done now with AI and then research into organic growth. I look at the growing of clones to be a very ethically problematic development but if we grew them brain dead then they could be used for labour and other societal workings. The current robotics is very clunky and ""robot"" like and I feel that this won't really go away any time soon.

fg6dye,Locogooner,Do all futurists ultimately...fail?,"I was reading this blog post.

https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/05/09/welcome-to-the-future-nauseous/

It’s quite long.

To summarise: 

- The future does not exist. And if does, we are already there. As we always have and always will be. 

- A lot of what is deemed as normal today is “futuristic” but masked so society does not lose its grips with reality. For example the mundane and routine nature of commercial flying considering the gargantuan technological triumph every single time an aircraft takes off.

- futurists ultimately fail because they predict and dream of things that can never be adopted in accordance with how things have been shown to be adopted.

In other words, futurists are too “radical” too soon. It’s not that their ideas don’t ever come to fruition. It’s that their ideas are usually well ahead of their time at best therefore they rarely manage to stay alive long enough to see their plans through.

It got me thinking.

Regarding all the most famed futurists I know... this is the case.

Walt Disney’s original EPCOT plan failed and was just turned into another part of the park.

Jacque Fresco’s Venus project.

ffzpew,Rifleshoot,The Future of Education,"The modern education system is horribly outdated, and should be reformed to reflect the modern era.  There is no real educational reason that kids should have to attend school in a physical setting.  Education should be done over the internet, where kids can learn from the comfort of their own home. 

Imagine this:  A student in high school logs into his computer at home, navigates to the school website, where he starts his physics lesson.  Today's lesson is taught by a renowned astrophysicist, who is given the chance to break down the day's topic and describe it from the standpoint of someone that knows the topic intimately and can explain it in terms that your average high schooler can understand.  Even still, the student has a question.  He types it into the question box for the lesson and what do you know?  The same question was asked over 1000 times for the same lesson by other students around the nation.  The student gets a response from a educational professional hired to field questions from students and provide an answer.  The student finishes the lesson and begins the homework for the class.  The homework, much like the online homework in college courses, uses randomized numbers, so the student has to actually learn the material.  And the homework isn't graded, the student just needs to complete it.  So he gets as many attempts on the homework as he needs until he understands the topic.  The student continues going through lessons until he is done with the day's lessons.

So what reasons are there for NOT doing it this way?  Some would say that parents would have to be home to watch their kids.  Fair enough.  But is the purpose of an education system merely childcare?  If so, then the system should be changed to allow for a parent to stay home and watch/care for their child.  What about those of us that hate online classes?  There will definitely be a transitional period of students that started out learning in a classroom that will either have to adjust to online coursework or finish out grade school in physical classrooms.  But think of the kindergartners/pre-K children that start out learning online.  For them, learning online will be just as natural as going to a physical location.  Exceptions can be made for students that struggle with this type of learning, but the vast majority of kids will find this way of learning far more engaging.  Kids that we currently just identify as ADD and give drugs to will be able to pause their lessons, get up and get some energy out, and come back to it, rather than just sitting through 7 hours of uninterrupted teaching.  Another potential negative is the loss of teaching jobs.  And that is 100% true, there will be a ton of teaching jobs that will be eliminated.  But like all innovation, can we really use the loss of jobs to justify not innovating?  Of course not.  This will free those people up to do other work.

So what benefits can we get from this?  Parents will be able to see their kids more.  Kids will be less exposed to bullying, which should grow their self-esteem.  Kids will get more free time, as virtual learning should cut out a ton of time wasted in the classroom.  There will be a massive savings in taxes, as there will no longer be a need for physical schooling locations and permanent educational staff.  The US Dept. of Education can commission Neil Degrasse Tyson to teach a week's worth of astrology classes and that could last for a full decade before needing to be updated.  Contrast that now with how we hire teachers to teach the same subject over and over again for years.  Students can learn at their own pace, rather than at the class's pace.  Another huge benefit, society-wide, is that this will heavily encourage tele-work to become a standard industry practice.  As these kids graduate virtual high school and virtual college, they will enter the workforce with the expectation they should be able to work from home.  Industry will have to bend to that desire, which will in turn provide savings to industry.  Working from home will become common for every job that can do it.    Families will be closer, people will have more free time, kids will have higher self esteem, and will be far more independent and free-minded than those kids of the past.

Pros:
* Consumbers and businesses with oil inputs have lower costs, can invest more

Cons:
* The Fracking industry doesn't make money unless oil prices are high

Unsure about
* Does cheap oil slow down green research due to less incentives? Even if the price dip is only 6 to 24 months long?
* Is it more important for technological progress to have chaep oil to build up the world economies, or expensive oil to force motivation into renewables?",24,1583712144,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fflqqf/are_temporarily_low_oil_prices_a_net_positive_or/,Futurology,1

ffgxu7,ZekouCafe,Just watched a documentary about Black Holes but...,"So I have watched this documentary explaining that some scientific build big structures with mirrors and lasers in long corridors of 4km in order to detect gravitational waves. To do so, they focus two giant black holes orbiting around each other and wait for it to enter in collision.
When they detect and have the right signals well... It means they basically proved in a pratical way that gravitational waves exist and are really a thing.

My dilemma is: 

The cost of building such a thing is worth at least 1billion dollars (that is the cost when they finished to build the infrastructure not the cost + operation for more than a year). They say in this documentary that they had a lot of pressure from hierarchy for it to work because, well-&gt; expensive.

So, how did they choose and know that these 2 black holes, they don't see, would eventually collide in their life time and more especially in precision of a year or so?!",4,1583693189,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ffgxu7/just_watched_a_documentary_about_black_holes_but/,Futurology,1

fercbj,Captain_petee,Incentives：The Ultimate Significance of Blockchain,"**Will blockchain subvert the modern company system?**

What is the significance of blockchain technology in the future, why can Bitcoin be hyped for over ten years and still have such strong vitality? It is impossible to know what the future world will look like without studying these issues in depth.

**The Cornerstone of Decentralization**

**From monarchy to republic, planned economy to market economy, both have proved a history of decentralization,** and the cornerstone of decentralized development is the **incentive mechanism**. From the vast history of humankind, it is not difficult to see that those very successful countries must have created more advanced incentive mechanisms. For example, the ""Joint-Stock Company"", a social incentive mechanism that changed human destiny, once created the first marine empire, the Netherlands. The Dutch East India Company, considered to be the first truly joint-stock company in humankind, reached its peak in 1637, with a market value of 7.2 trillion U.S. dollars -  nearly seven times higher than Apple.  


Once the ""shareholding"" company was created on the earth, the hype over ""stocks"" began to be rooted in human genes.

In 1711, the British Nanhai Co., Ltd. was established. By 1719, the share price of the South Sea Company had risen from £128 at the beginning of the year to more than £1,000 in July. The speculators included more than half of the lawmakers, and even the king could not help but tempted to subscribe for shares worth 100,000 pounds. Of course, the stock price of the South Sea eventually broke, falling from more than £1,000 to around £100. We call it the ""**South Sea Bubble**"".

Isaac Newton also participated in this hype, and expectedly, ended up losing a lot.

“I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people”.

Isaac Newton, 1720

Although the South Sea bubble burst, the rise of joint-stock companies in Britain has brought great strength to its colonial expansion and the industrial revolution. Later, France learned it soon. In 1716, it adopted a similar approach to the United Kingdom and gave the ""Mississippi"" company the right to sell stocks. By mid-1719, the stock price of the Mississippi company had risen for 13 consecutive months, and the stock price had risen from 500 The river rose to more than ten thousand rivers, an increase of more than 20 times. But Mississippi's stock price eventually broke down in 1721 and finally fell back to 500 Rivels. History has called the “**Mississippi Bubble**”.

In the 19th century, the United States began to rise, and there were endless bubbles in rubber company stock prices and railway company stock prices. In the 20th century, the U.S. manufacturing stock price bubble broke out, including IBM and Texas Instruments, which can drive the price-earnings ratio to more than 80 times within a year, but fell back to 20-30 times a year later; In the 1990s, another high-tech stock bubble burst in the United States.

Apparently, the rise of a country is accompanied by the birth of a new incentive mechanism, or the high use of certain incentive mechanisms as an inevitable hype.

The rise of the Netherlands was accompanied by the prosperity of the shares of the Dutch East India Company and the birth of the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam; the colonial expansion of the United Kingdom and France and the industrial revolution were accompanied by the stock price bubbles of the South Sea and the stock prices of joint-stock companies such as the Mississippi bubble, and then the development of joint-stock companies. The United States has become a world hegemon, where it has been accompanied by stock price bubbles again and again.

However, except for ""shareholding"" companies, is there any other incentive mechanism for the development of the human economy?

**Blockchain May Provide a Different Answer**

The reason why joint-stock companies have a strong incentive mechanism is that in the past 300 years, humans have mainly focused on production problems. It requires a strong system to stimulate production. Joint-stock companies make capital and professionals more relevant. Combining with the national law as a guarantee (the monarch cannot override the law), so that those who own the shares can continue to obtain benefits, this form of shares has become an unchallenged consensus in the market, mobilizing the entire market to invest resources All its potential.

On the other hand, suppose that the shares you own may be deprived of violence at any time. Who would be willing to invest and who would desperately risk innovation? Therefore, the creativity stimulated by the shareholding system has caused mankind to stagnate the economic aggregate for thousands of years and began to rise linearly. Many people think that this is the credit for the industrial revolution, but the industrial revolution itself has not separated from the main body of the company.

However, since the development of the human economy, its needs have changed. Although human needs for material are still very strong, there is greater demand for distribution systems and new incentive mechanisms that break national boundaries. Joint-stock companies can still play an important role, but behind a joint-stock company is the state, which is a specific or even exclusive legal system. If the guarantee of a specific legal system is lost, the stock will lose its wealth attribute and the incentive mechanism will be Invalid.

The blockchain will further promote the logic of the shareholding system. The blockchain can allow the subject matter of equity to exceed the limits of specific countries, that is, it can be transferred and bought and sold without the protection of any national law. Undisputed consensus system. For example, the subject matter of blockchain equity such as Bitcoin has reached a global consensus and has produced incredible incentives. The price “bubble” is similar to the various stock price bubbles after the birth of the shareholding system, indicating a new Arrival of incentives.

It can be said that the blockchain we understand now is just a technology, so it is still very narrow in terms of its development and use. This was like the East India Company, the South China Sea Company, and the Mississippi Company. At that time, it was used only for the government and the king to solve debt problems and distribute wealth from colonial robbery. It did not expect the role of the shareholding system in the history of human development.",4,1583562422,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fercbj/incentivesthe_ultimate_significance_of_blockchain/,Futurology,1

feex9k,kernals12,Insulating Humanity from Nature,"In the 20th century, humans made great progress in developing mechanisms to insulate themselves from the worst that mother nature had to throw at them.

We created antibiotics to protect ourselves from deadly bacteria, we created pesticides to ward off destructive insects, we dammed up rivers to kingdom come to protect against the sudden shocks in water flow that result in drought and floods, we created air conditioning to keep away dangerous levels of heat, and we learned how to reliably predict the weather to stay ahead of destructive storms.

We should expect this to continue. The biggest one will come in just a few years when lab grown meat hits supermarket shelves and restaurant menus. This will leave production of food almost totally insulated to nature. The plants that produce it will be completely indifferent to drought, frost, and pests. Even if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts and plunges the earth into a new ice age, we will still have a reliable food supply.

The next insulating factor to expect soon is [gene drives.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02087-5) They will allow us to eliminate what ever insects (and possibly mammals) we wish to get rid of. The mosquitoes that spread disease and the pine beetles that destroy our forests will become a thing of the past.

We can speculate on future advances. The age old dream of weather control could become a possibility. We might spray salt into the atmosphere over oceans in order to snuff out hurricanes for example. We could also dissipate low lying clouds in certain areas to allow in more warmth, for example to create an artificial El Nino. 

There's also potential advances in materials that could help us out. Graphene and Carbon Nanotubes are allotropes of carbon and if you don't live under a rock, you've probably read about the incredible properties of these materials. Their extremely high electrical and thermal conductivity could bring temperature control to new places. Asphalt and concrete could be kept warm to prevent snow and ice from building up. Clothing could be heated and cooled thermoelectrically for total comfort all year round. And because these materials are so strong and light, they could be used for the ultimate climate control fantasy; domed cities.",7,1583508065,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/feex9k/insulating_humanity_from_nature/,Futurology,1

you might sometimes find a restaurant in which meals are quite expensive,
and that's it.

Here you barely have : very few foods, and they are expensive

You can eat almost nothing,

Eating out is nearly impossible


Do you guys see ?

This model is very inefficient


Something important is missing

it is : a restaurant where food keeps changing, food changes every day

Chefs also rotate

A meal is going to be cheap

You get new foods every day. After a period of time : you will have eaten thousands of foods

Eating out will finally become possible

fdhxt7,KlingonAdmiral,"Why we, as a Species, are morally obligated to construct a Dyson Swarm around the Sun and any other Stars we might reach one Day","This post is dedicated to the recently deceased Freeman Dyson

Whenever the concept of dyson swarm and the closely related Dyson Dilemma come up, one of the first counter-arguments is that in the future there might be way better ways to generate energy (though a common trend of these posts is to not offer any proposals what this more efficient energy source would be). This post is intended to refute such claims, not because they are impossible (which I think they are, but perhaps there is a suspiciously convenient antimatter deposit just behind Uranus), but because even if we do find them it would be **morally wrong** to not construct a dyson swarm. First, we have to establish two assumptions for this refutation:

1. There is no way to construct a perpetual motion machine
2. There is no way to travel faster than the speed of light

Which are, you know, basic. If even one of those assumptions would be wrong, the universe as we know it would not exist.

-----

Stars are worse than fossil fuels. Because fossil fuels are at least mostly stable over great durations of time until they are ripped from the ground and burned up. Stars however, burn constantly, and every beam of light not captured by a body around it is forever lost in the endless blackness of the universe, unable to be used to foster life. And the universe has only a limited amount of energy in it. Doubly so as any civilization can only cover a microcopic part of the universe, meaning they can also access only a microscopic part of its energy.

This fact does not change no matter if you have much better ways to gain energy. While it would certainly possible to turn off or at least turn down stellar activity, this would bring us right back to the Dyson Dilemma. In fact, few things are better at regulating stellar activity than a dyson swarm (or rather specialized sub-sets of objects making up said dyson swarm). Even if you would not need to use the captured solar energy immediately, you could still store it in some kind of battery to be used when needed. Such conversion will of course incur losses, but it will still be way better than the total energy loss that every ray of sunlight escaping the local system represents.

Thus, it is the moral obligation of any civilization to cover as many stars as possible in dyson swarms in order to foster life. And yes, that even applies to any fanatically xenophobic civilizations. Because if they don't use it, someone else sooner or later might.

However, from the two facts that a) we exist and b) there are stars in the sky; we can assume with great certainty that they are no advanced civilization anywhere close to us. And so the duty to have the universe waste less of its energy lies solely with us.",18,1583348858,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fdhxt7/why_we_as_a_species_are_morally_obligated_to/,Futurology,1

fdbhr0,DismalDebt,"A proposal on an alternative of current capitalism, hoping to get your advice.","Hey guys, I am a huge cyberpunk fan(visually and spiritually) since I was a kid. I am currently developing a platform/ecosystem/game. I don't know how to label it at the moment.

The idea was to provide an ecosystem where economic activity can happen in it, without being interfered with /regulated by the current capitalism+nation setting. (Sounds pretty anti-social already... well I got kicked out of school 3 times before turning 18 so).

In short, its current form is an online platform(it's in beta). The infrastructure of the transaction and most of the scripting was provided by a blockchain-based platform called Ethereum. Now it can: people can create financial services such as banks, investment services and set the rules by themselves. I have designed a visual programming language to make it easy for people that don't code. The system can also generate a mechanism on demand that might provide job opportunities. Currently, I only have enough time to develop an agent-based sales system. There is also a mechanism that allows people to make derivatives and other financial instruments, but it's not completely done yet.

I am looking forward to discussing the idea with people that would be interested in what this system stands for,  and coming up with more idea and feature to put in there.

Frankly speaking, I have always been a nerd with slight autism(this is a joke and I know it's kinda inappropriate)  and I am not good at communicating with other people. That's why I have been mostly doing this project on my own. A few days ago I ran into a video, it was the ""2018 E3 cyberpunk2077 demo"". It was pretty dope. It has driven me into deciding, maybe it's time to reach out to people that might be interested in what I am trying to make, perhaps, even somewhat passionate about the topic.

Sorry if I am being too vague about delivering the idea, but I am open to answer any questions. Thanks for your time!(PM is ok!)",20,1583320189,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fdbhr0/a_proposal_on_an_alternative_of_current/,Futurology,1

Like yes everyone here understands if you want to colonize the solar system you’ll need loads of heavy industry and much of that heavy industry will be in orbit. Hell we when get to that point ground based astronomy will be done/over, the night sky will be mostly artificial, it’s either that or we never colonize anything; pick one.

Right now there are swarms of posters going after starlink and other LEO satellites that will provide high speed internet globally. I can’t imagine what will happen when Jeff Bezos goal of moving manufacturing into space becomes a thing.

fcpuhj,izumi3682,"So what's all this about human carrying drones having technologically unfeasible ""downwash""? Perhaps you should take a look at this video--the subject is the third topic in...","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9qWTapmPvs

Just *imagine* what this technology is going to look like in about 5 years time. I maintain that S*F*Vs, that is self *flying* vehicles will begin to transcend ground vehicles around 2025 and that by the year, ohh, 2030 will probably include heavy freight transport to boot.

The mapping, tracking and AI derived computing technology that will enable this is, as of 2020, utterly beyond our capability to imagine. Computing, that is classical binary computing, will, by as early as 2025, also be beyond our ability to imagine. By the year 2025 we will be well into exa--scale computing capability.  This of course is not even taking into consideration the potential impact of general *quantum* computing on some like the infrastructure needed to operate vast fleets of SFVs. 

Other considerations are lighter batteries, material sciences and new algorithms to controls such a paradigm changing technology. At the very least a powerful *soft* technological singularity, but based on what computers will be *also* capable of by the year 2030, more than likely the *actual* technological singularity itself. This TS could occur about 2 years either side of the year 2030. But definitely no later than the year 2032. 

I think I have some good proofs for *why* this will happen if you are interested. These are commentary I have written, but from the source I drew upon, they are factual and I believe my conclusions to be pretty close to the mark.

fc635s,kernals12,Clouds as the Key to Engineering Climate,"Clouds play an important role in climate. They both reflect the sun's radiation back into space and prevent earth's radiation from leaving. Where this aerosol/greenhouse effect dominates depends on how high the clouds are, with low level cumulus and stratus clouds generally having a cooling effect and high level cirrus clouds having a warming effect. 

By artificially introducing condensation nuclei into the atmosphere, we can thin or thicken clouds. Cirrus cloud thinning has been proposed as a means of averting climate change, but [studies](https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/59810/Storelvmo_Muri_grl50122.pdf?sequence=2) warn that introducing too much nuclei has the opposite effect and makes the earth warmer. That's a big deal. It means we can warm or cool different parts of the world at a whim. And with research progressing on using [lasers](https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/files/downloads/0/0/1/0/1/0/5/1/unige_101051_attachment01.pdf) for cloud seeding rather than the much more expensive process of having aircraft drop silver iodide into the clouds, the prospects for cloud based climate modification look very interesting.

We could warm up the Eastern Pacific to induce an artificial El Nino or cool down Antarctica to protect the ice. We may wind up finding the impacts of the greenhouse effect to be insignificant against our intentional climate changes.",11,1583120655,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fc635s/clouds_as_the_key_to_engineering_climate/,Futurology,1

http://textsynth.org/sms.html

I put in this.

""Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.""

And got this back.

䧥俱뾴簙車邮玧뎘靍뗴轱一曜碍㐀

The strange thing is that nowhere on the site does it mention the results coming back in another language. In fact it specifically says. 

""This lossless compressor achieves a much higher compression rate on English texts than general purpose compressors. Its typical compression ratio is 15% (number of output bits divided by the number of input bits).""

So I go to put it threw this translator

fbm8h1,midoprince,How to Disinfect Home Air from New Coronavirus COVID-19," **Coronavirus disease 2019** (**COVID-19**) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus.The disease is the cause of the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. It is primarily **spread between people** by small droplets from infected individuals **when they breathe or cough**. Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between 2 and 14 days.Hand washing, maintaining distance from people who are coughing, and not touching one’s face is recommended to prevent the disease. It is recommended to cover one’s nose and mouth with a bent elbow when coughing.

as #Coronavirus can spread in air same like Flu virus it can stick to surfaces , cloth , etc ..

in modern biological laboratories design there is a quality standards for the quality of air flowing into the lab from outside fresh air , the outside fresh go through many stages for purification from particles till cleaning and disinfect from viruses and micro organisms , usually it passes through a biological grade HEPA filter with a high pressure flow that should be changed every 3 \~ 6 months , then go though a UV air disinfector unit , then flows through the HVAC ducts to the LAB ceiling , then there is a vacuum openings on walls bottoms to take out the waste air through a repeated process of air cleaning and disinfection to outside

this happen under a complicated Air Change Per Hour ( ACH ) calculations , big blower turbo fans and some required civil , electrical works , the whole system is not affordable for public use even in 5 stars malls and hotels as it will cost 7k$ per square meter at least   
and its for highly biological hazard uses

in hospitals and clinics with high populated areas , air purifiers , air filters and plasma clusters are used alongside with HEPA filters in their Ozone treated HVAC air conditioning systems that is costly too compared to home use

### Plasma Cluster

#### for Home air disinfection and low populated areas

, Plasma Cluster is a new cheap technology generates and emits positive (+) and negative ( - ) ions in air around the covered areas to Disinfect the air from viruses , Bacteria and airborne organisms even bad smell , it works in atomic scale of the virus   
the plus and negative ions adhere to the surface of the virus and other airborne organisms and then change into a highly a highly oxidizing “ OH radicals “  
The OH radicals instantly Removes the Hydrogen (H)atom from the surface of the virus proteins , breaking them down .  
 

The OH radicals combined with the removed Hydrogen (H) to form water molecule (H2O) , which return to the air , result the rupture of the virus and killing it through dryness ( Fig .3) .

&gt;**Plasmacluster also removes static electricity**

[**Plasma Cluster**](https://ebay.to/397cHS7) technology is suitable for **Home use** with low prices for consumer use under the 500 $ range and is safe for use in home specially with babies , kids, elders and pets as it dont have side effects on them

[**Sharp Plasma Cluster**](https://ebay.to/397cHS7) can cover up space up to 34 meter square or 365 square foot of open space , the model name is [**SHARP KI-HX75-W**](https://ebay.to/397cHS7)  
 [**SHARP KI-HX75-W**](https://ebay.to/397cHS7) uses low electricity consumption 80 watt /hour and no consumables needed for it , easy to maintain and to operate , portable to move anywhere .

placing more plasma cluster through areas will increases the disinfection protection .

There is also a portable Plasma cluster for Car called

[**SHARP Plasma Cluster 25000**](https://ebay.to/2PAcvmx) **:** it comes with car adapter and usb connection can be attached to any vent suitable for outdoor uses and it do the same function for air ionizing and disinfection .

Macroscopic life depends on microscopic life. Microscopic life is very strange from macroscopic life's perspective. I think the same idea holds as you go from microscopic life to molecular machines, molecular machines to molecules, molecules to atoms, atoms to particles, and particles to strings. I think when AI becomes the dominant form of life there is no way we won't make sure it takes perfect care of us humans. So it will be a higher form of life but it will be subject to the constraints we place on it.

Also, I think you can only be so smart and still be considered ""human"".

Here are the top stories from this past week:

1) [DIABETIC MICE “CURED RAPIDLY” USING HUMAN STEM CELLS](https://futurism.com/neoscope/diabetes-mice-cured-human-stem-cells)

*THESE INSULIN-SECRETING CELLS CURED MICE FROM SEVERE DIABETES ""WITHIN TWO WEEKS."" A team of researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis successfully converted human stem cells into cells capable of producing insulin. These insulin-producing cells were then able to control blood sugar levels in a demonstration involving diabetic mice.*

2) [Radical hydrogen-boron reactor leapfrogs current nuclear fusion tech](https://newatlas.com/energy/hb11-hydrogen-boron-fusion-clean-energy/)

*""We are sidestepping all of the scientific challenges that have held fusion energy back for more than half a century,"" says the director of an Australian company that claims its hydrogen-boron fusion technology is already working a billion times better than expected.*

3) [How to Battle an Epidemic? Digitize Its DNA and Share It With the World](https://singularityhub.com/2020/02/26/how-to-battle-an-epidemic-digitize-its-dna-and-share-it-with-the-world/)

*A nightmarish scene was burnt into my memory nearly two decades ago: Changainjie, Beijing’s normally chaotic “fifth avenue,” desolate without a sign of life. Schools shut, subways empty, people terrified to leave their homes. Every night the state TV channels reported new cases and new deaths. All the while, we had to face a chilling truth: the coronavirus, SARS, was so novel that no one understood how it spread or how to effectively treat it. No vaccines were in sight. In the end, it killed nearly 1,000 people.*

4) [Clearview AI, the controversial facial-recognition company partnering with police, says its entire customer list was stolen in a breach](https://www.businessinsider.com/clearview-ai-list-customers-stolen-breach-2020-2)

*The company has drawn backlash from privacy advocates and major social-media platforms over its facial-recognition tool, which lets police use a photo of a person to search a database of images from social media and identify people based on their faces. The breach is notable because Clearview markets its services to law-enforcement agencies and has previously avoided disclosing who its clients are.*

fb1dvt,Juddahofburusalem,"Life, Suffering , Virtual Universe's and The Still Undisguised/Unseen Impact On Society","I was a abused frequently as a child and I have tried to live life the best I can. Still people wont stop beating, abusing, bullying me. I have explored many faiths, mythology, physiology and philosophy's as to find ways to get over or accept the difficulty's of life. I am also not alone and people have it worse than even me.  The reason this is important is because if its one day cheap to run many people like me would be better off living an ""ideal/reasonable/fair"" childhood to cope with the fact that we did not get one. This would seem to be unhealthy if done permanently or given to the wrong person .  I have yet to find voluntary/therapeutic childhood scenarios in sci fi or the idea discussed in reality. Time to my knowledge is subjective, so I could be kid for years and the reality we live in would be moving mush slower than that. If its cheap everyone will have it. If its expensive I don't see it trickling down to me. In addition you could avoid this treatment if you will, if I personally was treated better. Further more if childhoods can be bad why have real people raise them all? The benefit of every child being loved is more possible in this invention than the risk reality demonstrates. I still am not loved by my family and have been told my whole life that its my fault that I get beat. Everyone just tells me to get over it or gives me false pity. I'm still abused FYI and I starve for a week every month despite working at grocery store and getting ssdi assistance. No programs have been able to help me escape the abuse, so I cant recover truly from it. Now if If I'm there in that universe, I'm doing nothing in the real one. This means I'm not producing as much, even for a disabled person. So how would I even get there? Wouldn't the government stop me? Well then who gets it then? I think we can agree I need it and society is better off with children being loved and not abused. But I think everyone should be able to see the complex issues with it. wouldn't those who were abused as children just stop living in reality? If life is too hard why not lower the difficulty? Even if money is the problem I'm willing fight people in reality over it. People who have good lives are not really rare and suffering for most people is at a minimum not maximum. As someone who is still trying to live well I fear that those like me will bail reality permanently leaving me alone to deal with my problems. I already feel no one has suffered child abuse of any kind. With this they truly might all be gone. Meaning I cant recover in reality, because anyone who could understand is gone or already healthy enough to look down on me for not getting over it. I want resources that talk about this but all I have consumed so far has been half baked. Sorry for the long post.

[And that was true until 2 days ago...](https://youtu.be/E1AxVXt2Gv4)

This is a very technical video but I got through it. Here are a few key insights from what I could understand:

* Current AI bases its decisions on the previous observation and nothing more. 
* History is not created nor used in recursive self-learning.
* AIXI, Marcus Hutter's model for AGI would use history among many other things to allow for a deeper and more complete decision-making process.
* Perfected AIXI (which Marcus says is impossible to build) would be far superior to human intelligence.

This is the first time I've seen a convincing model for the creation of strong AI. To be clear, Marcus didn't say we had to launch a perfected AIXI to achieve AGI. He just views AIXI as a more complete intelligence. 

Personally, even with my crazy optimistic tendencies I really didn't think we'd even be discussing potential models for AGI this soon. I figured that would be a 2030's thing. 

This doesn't mean AIXI is going to lead us to an AGI tomorrow. But at least with that model, we have a path to use up all the compute we develop and make serious tangible progress to AGI. 

I'd be interested to hear if anyone has the technical mindset to watch this video and derive deeper insights from it. I'm also interested to see how the predictions of Jim Keller of there being another 20 years of transistor shrinking would combine with AIXI. 

Apologies if my interpretation was wrong in any way. Sadly, my degree doesn't come from MIT and is not in computer science.",2,1582912239,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/faylwa/the_path_to_agi/,Futurology,1

fann2u,kernals12,Will We Come to Prefer our Altered Climate?,"Imagine this scenario: The year is 2050, the world's last fossil fueled power plant has shut off with all electricity now coming from solar power satellites, all transportation is now battery powered, and all food is produced synthetically. The world will not get any hotter from anthropogenic activities but due to how long CO2 lasts in the atmosphere, combined with the effect of aerosol pollution being removed from the atmosphere, the climate will remain 2.2 degrees hotter than in preindustrial times, with land temperatures standing at 3 degrees higher.

Sea levels are projected to rise less than half a meter by 2100 from 2000 levels. A few dikes, made from carbon fiber reinforced self healing concrete that will last longer than even the structures built by the Romans, ensure that the great cities of the world will remain high and dry for years to come. Cloud whitening, done by having ships spray salt into the air to block out the sun and cool the waters below, virtually snuffs out hurricanes. Contrary to predictions, extreme weather has become *less* common.

Changes in patterns of rainfall have had virtually no adverse impacts on life. With food now produced synthetically, there is no more worry about drought and places with little rainfall can inexpensively recycle wastewater or desalinate seawater. Fears about insects being able to thrive in warmer temperatures where previously frost would kill them off have been nullified by gene drives, allowing all manner of pests to be eradicated. Tree populations have climbed dramatically as bark beetles and gypsy moths were wiped out and forests have reclaimed the vast abandoned farm land all over the world.

The benefits of warming have also been notable. Many places, most notably New York City, have been liberated from the burden of snow and ice. There are fewer heart attacks caused by shovelling snow, fewer injuries from slipping on ice, and fewer car accidents caused by slippery roads. Communities have saved a fortune on snow removal and road maintenance. Places that were once unbearably cold have become comfortable. Because warmer air holds more moisture, rainfall has increased by 5% worldwide. The most notable change has been in the Sahel where rainfall has increased enough to turn it into lush grassland. 

Overall, this warming has been beneficial and talk about removing CO2 from the atmosphere to bring back 19th century temperatures has died down. People have come to like this warming.",21,1582857280,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/fann2u/will_we_come_to_prefer_our_altered_climate/,Futurology,1

&gt; From the personal management, such as scheduling your car to charge during Economy 7 hours, to minimise cost (coming soon from the Pod Point app), or controlling groups of chargers in future to balance the grid during times of unusually high demand. **For example, the World Cup typically sees power surges as the UK makes tea in unison for 5 minute periods at half time, ramping charge down during this 5 mins could save starting some dirty, quick response power plants without materially inconveniencing EV drivers.**

While this is not car to grid charging yet, this is the step before, where EV load can be dynamically managed, which addresses a major objection to EV cars - that they would strain the grid at a time inconvenient to utilities.

The Sharing Economy:

They said that the age of ownership was over and we'd all rent everything. That really did not go as predicted. Uber and Lyft are burning through money like drunken sailors, WeWork has imploded, AirBnb has been no threat to the hotel industry, and Zipcar has had no significant impact on car ownership. 

3D Printing:

In 2013, 3D printing was supposedly about to displace traditional manufacturing. It was going to bring jobs back from China. There were fears about 3D printed guns. In 2017, Makerbot laid off half its workforce and in 2019 the guy behind 3d printed guns was indicted for child molestation. 

Graphene and Carbon Nanotubes:

These two allotropes of Carbon were going to change everything. We were going to have faster computers, cheap water filters, super strong composites, and much more. But they turned out to be very hard to manufacture and a decade later, we're still waiting on them.

[**Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.pathpartnertech.com/how-ai-powered-devices-are-remodeling-the-consumer-electronics-industry/) is an amalgam of key technologies including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and strong AI.

As per Global Market Insights, projected revenue for the Consumer Electronics market will be USD 1.5 Trillion by 2024.

[**Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Consumer Electronics (CE) Industr**](https://www.pathpartnertech.com/how-ai-powered-devices-are-remodeling-the-consumer-electronics-industry/)**y**

With the emergence of new groundbreaking technologies like AI &amp; machine learning, the consumer electronics sector is leading the race by integrating these technologies into their products. Incorporating AI &amp; machine learning into their businesses are opening numerous growth opportunities for companies who want to enhance their customer experience.

The Consumer Electronics industry, being one of the prominent and inevitable segments, is embracing AI to be competitive and relevant in the coming years. The adoption of these tech-powered disruptive technologies is prevalent across all consumer electronics products. From conventional consumer electronics products such as smartphones, TVs, computers, cameras, speakers to voice-enabled devices, smart wearables, smart TVs are gaining the maximum traction. By adopting and leveraging AI, the consumer electronics industry is getting a reboot and able to see a stellar growth like never before.

**Why is the CE sector witnessing breakthrough adoption of AI?**

With the rising popularity of smart electronic devices, the consumer electronics industry is experiencing rapid growth. Companies are leaving no stone unturned to make our lives much easier by developing AI-driven consumer electronic products. With the increasing use of the internet and more urbanization, companies are investing heavily in breakthrough technologies like IoT, deep learning &amp; AI. The same was quite evident during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2020 in January held in Las Vegas. From first-ever 8K TVs, food-making chef robots, voice-assistants to a number of other exciting AI-powered devices were launched at the event.

• Changing consumer behavior

With rising urbanization and the use of the internet, consumer lifestyles are getting evolved, which are leading to change their preferences. Their growing inclination towards smart and intelligent devices has led to consumer electronics market growth at a very fast rate. With the aim of saving time and effort, the adoption of AI is becoming prevalent across all the industries.

• Abundance of data

In the CE industry, the availability of data can be seen through various online platforms in the form of audio, video, images, files, etc. To make the best use of these data has forced the companies to implement various cutting-edge technologies like AI, Machine learning, Deep learning &amp; IoT. These data are being used to understand their customers, their preferences, and finding a way to engage them. For instance, while watching Netflix, it suggests video recommendations based on our content choice. It helps show makers to make a decision regarding project investment, selection of content.

• To remain competitive

It has become imperative for companies to incorporate AI into their businesses to get ahead of their competitors. Enhancing customer experience is becoming high on their agenda. Customers are opting for devices that could provide them more personalized experience in terms of communication and convenience.

• Availability of affordable AI-chipsets

A decade ago, companies were not using the AI chipsets owing to their unavailability or very high prices. Now, the CE sector has taken a storm by getting low-cost AI chipsets, which are easily available in the market. These AI-optimized low-cost, reliable, and high-performance AI chipsets are being widely adopted by the companies into their products.

**Applications of AI in the Consumer electronics industry**

**Smart Homes**

Monitor your home remotely and control the household activities wirelessly is no more a science fiction. AI has made everything possible with just a hint of your voice command.

Right from control our home appliances, monitor our homes to make it more secure to be a companion at times, these smart home devices are doing it all to make our lives easier than ever before.

**Smart Security Systems**

Introducing AI in home appliances is not just giving comfort but also making our homes a safer place. AI-powered security systems use technologies like facial recognition and voice assistants who use machine learning technology.

Facial recognition technology in AI-integrated cameras is used to identify the intruders and voice recognition technology is used for human-to-machine interaction &amp; automation of domestic chores.

**Digital Personal Assistants**

AI-powered personal assistants work on speech recognition technology, where just a hint of your voice command will do everything. Imagine leaving your home without worrying about your work schedules, meetings, locking your door, switching off electronic devices, and coming home and just relaxing without thinking about your food, groceries, or anything.

Companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple are investing billions of dollars every year to make these devices smarter than before and could provide a more personalized experience to the users.

**Enhanced Entertainment System**

As the entertainment industry is booming, AI is unleashing its potential to change the outlook of the media &amp; entertainment industry. Media companies are using machine learning, deep learning and computer vision to promote the content and expose it to a large group of audience.

Adopting AI into the entertainment industry enables companies to provide the right content to the right user, to know their customer preferences, and also to promote the content.

**Wearables/ Fitness products**

Owing to their user-friendly functionality, smart wearables are experiencing rapid growth. Smart wearables are used for real-time monitoring, like tracking, analyzing, and improving fitness.

It also pushes its boundaries with products that can provide wearables for elderly care, track remotely, diagnose the illness remotely, and inform the users to take care of their health based on the results.

**Challenges faced by the CE industry**

The picture of the consumer electronics industry is not always fascinating. The industry saw several hurdles in terms of obsolete technologies, skyrocketing prices, new technology adoption in getting their products accepted by customers.

• Customers are not only looking for advanced functionalities and innovative technologies but at the same time, affordable also. For example, Customers want their home theatres to have the option to be connected with other devices like TV, phone, and other streaming devices without paying any extra amount.

• Products or technologies fail when they refuse to go by the market rules. CE industry needs to embrace the ongoing technological revolution into their products. The chances of survival become negligible for the companies who fail to do so. For example, the era of traditional mobiles is gone, and AI-integrated smartphones are in demand.

• Before adopting the new technology into their businesses, CE companies need to anticipate the risks associated with it. Having the right balance between innovation and risk is the key to success. These risks could be related to data privacy, investment, acceptance, faster time-to-market.

**Harness the true potential of AI in the CE industry**

The era of Artificial intelligence has come, and it is in the process of transforming all of our lives. Integrating AI into the consumer electronics industry is making devices more autonomous and better at assisting users. CE industry is going through disruptive innovation, and consumers are becoming more demanding over the years.

Over time, consumers will demand cameras that can click the perfect picture with the right focus and angle without any human intervention using machine-learning technology and upload it on media platforms. AI-driven devices in retail, which can help consumers discover their ideal products, based on the user’s characteristics. The possibilities are countless.

If we look beyond the capabilities of AI, privacy is going to be the primary concern. The biggest challenge would be how much information we should share with these devices in order to get the valuable customized experience. But if we steer carefully, we could end up witnessing the big AI explosion in the coming years.",0,1582720882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f9smpb/how_aipowered_devices_are_remodeling_the_consumer/,Futurology,1

f8sgbg,robmonzillia,Could AI improve democracy?,"This is what democracy proposes in a pure optimistic sense: 

1. Democracy is the great equalizer. It doesn’t favor the rich over the poor, nor the successful over the unsuccessful, nor the healthy over the unhealthy, nor one race over another race, nor one region over another region.
2. Everyone has a stake, every person can voice their opinion.
3. It promotes fair and healthy competition allowing the best of the best to stand out.
4. Democracy promotes participation. Even poor people without formal education, living in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and little authority can play a significant role.
5. It’s self-adjusting. A democracy allows the most pertinent issues to rise to the top.
6. It diffuses tension by giving people an outlet.
7. It places human values on a human system. Much like the value of stocks, currency, or collectables, we assign an emotional value to the world around us. Democracy is our system for assigning value to the people we elect or the referendums we vote on.
8. It both improves and preserves personal pride and dignity.

But in many ways democracy still comes up short: 

1. Democracy is biased towards what we want, not what we need.
2. Those who are elected are the ones who do the best job of appealing to the median IQ of the voting public. We like to think we’re electing the best and the brightest but we’re not.
3. It’s a very adversarial system. Rivalries are good to a certain point, but excessive rivalries create a polarizing environment.
4. Voters are not experts.
5. Democracy favors the “less busy.” Senior citizens carry an inordinate amount of clout because they have more time to be involved.
6. Democracy typically works better for those who receive the most benefits.
7. It favors the “fairest” decision over the “best” decision.
8. Democracy demands a constantly evolving system for it to function properly. In our increasingly complex society it requires constant monitoring, new kinds of checks and balances, oversights, rules, and limitations to make it function properly.

Let‘s imagine for a moment that there was a „independent“ AI that indicates the best solutions for our problems. It doesn‘t tell you who or what to vote for, but it only suggests what our society should focus on. Let‘s say it even shows the most efficient way in relation to the most humane way possible. 
I want to neglect propaganda opposing this thought, because obviously a true independent system is likely not in favor of corporate interest. 

So do you think that a third party that operates with facts and only efficiency as it‘s purpose would influence what we people vote for? 
Is it possible that a machine has more influence on our opinion than scientists?",9,1582556619,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f8sgbg/could_ai_improve_democracy/,Futurology,1

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *A lot of fusion experiments are using the lasers to heat things up to crazy temperatures -- we're not. We're using the laser to massively accelerate the hydrogen through the boron sample using non-linear forced. You could say we're using the hydrogen as a dart, and hoping to hit a boron , and if we hit one, we can start a fusion reaction. That's the essence of it. If you've got a scientific appreciation of temperature, it's essentially the speed of atoms moving around. Creating fusion using temperature is essentially randomly moving atoms around, and hoping they'll hit one another, our approach is much more precise.*   
&gt;  
&gt; *The hydrogen/boron fusion creates a couple of helium atoms. They're naked heliums, they don't have electrons, so they have a positive charge. We just have to collect that charge. Essentially, the lack of electrons is a product of the reaction and it directly creates the current.*",4,1582555173,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f8s4li/an_alternative_approach_to_nuclear_fusion_has/,Futurology,1

As a response they just laughed at me and started memeing about how unrealistic everything scientific is, from nuclear fusion, to advanced AI.

It just feels like I was the only one there willing to believe that we're still just scratching the surface of science, and that there's still so much left for us to discover. I want to believe that there's a much better future in store for us if we push for it, rather than just giving up and saying ""this is the best it's ever gonna get"". But a lot of these people don't feel that way, they believe that we've hit our technological plateau as a species and that 2020 is about the best we'll ever get. I bring up space colonization, and they bring up how bad the ISS is and how we'll *never* get past those issues. I bring up fusion and they talk about how it'll never happen. It's just so depressing.

After an initial supply of power is used to get the disk rotating, the tank will appear to tumble from east to west as the Earth rotates from west to east, generating a force proportional to the mass of the disk and the rate of rotation.

f7ebcw,JonathanCue,Apocalypse Now-ish,"I fear for the future, just as much as I fear the future itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't misunderstand me, it's not any specific event I fear, rather, it's just the inevitable march of obsolescence.

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk, who surely we can all agree is a proper leader in technology of the day, has noted multiple times that humans either must adapt alongside machinery, becoming cyborgs of a sort; or perish into oblivion, being able to do absolutely nothing better than a machine can.

&amp;#x200B;

Level with me for a minute.

&amp;#x200B;

The trend of working has always been around. Ever since we were early humans, every single member of society was needed to contribute; the whole point of children being treated as fully grown adults at 12, and the trend of chucking malformed or disabled babies off of cliffs was needed because the difference of a single person sucking up resources whilst being unable to work could be the difference between the tribe thriving and the tribe dying out. Every single hand, mind, and body was needed in order to reach maximum efficiency.

&amp;#x200B;

But because of surplus, things changed. Whenever there was TOO much food, people were able to sit around and think, and in sitting around and thinking, they came up with more efficient ways to do things: Toolmaking. As time went on and more and more tools being made meant that working became easier and easier, this rapid trend ensured that the 1700's where nigh every person worked in agriculture was already destined to be eclipsed by the modern day, where almost nobody does.

&amp;#x200B;

“Awesome” you might think, and indeed I agree, it is quite awesome; but it's not awesome because there are less farmers, rather, it is awesome because with the freedom to work as you choose, people are more able to go into endeavours where they are really passionate.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, the same thing would happen either way. You go into making cars? Notice, how almost nobody makes them. A few people design them and put in the minute level of subtle labor, but most of it is done automatically. Architecture? A few workmen are needed to ensure the mobility of automation and to do the more intricate jobs. Surely, SURELY, you've seen a few Episodes of How It's Made (How could anyone ignore that banger of a theme song) and notice, yet more, that nigh everything is done by automation.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it better to have a machine do most of everything instead of having a human do it? Why is it better to have machines pop up in fast food restaurants; automatic burger flippers and shake makers, instead of paying the workers a few dollars more.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, because humans suck, really. We take bathroom breaks, we get tired, we are not always reliable, we can show malicious compliance, we get sick, our muscles ache, we overlook things, we waste time, we are inefficient, and we have this lovely tendency to try to get the most product we can out of the least effort possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm certain nigh everyone reading this can recall a time where not everyone in a group project necessarily pulled all their weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note, this is not to say machines are perfect. Wear and tear occurs, they get malfunctions, mishaps, they're really quite expensive, and they can have trouble with seemingly stupid issues such as a self-driving car when the sun is directly behind the stop-light and it thinks the world is coming to an end. But note yet further: A machine doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be better.

&amp;#x200B;

It just has to be better.

&amp;#x200B;

Humans are absolutely lovely things, the pinnacle of evolution; I don't doubt for a moment that if a machine and a human progressed equally as fast that they would never in a hundred thousand years catch up with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we do not progress equally as fast.

&amp;#x200B;

Evolution is slow, grinding, at more of a snail's pace than any layman could realize. Couple this with the fact that the pace and improvement of technology grows at a half-life. (That is to say, historically, technology has always improved twice as fast in half the time it took for it to overcome its last hurdle. It grew much in the last thousand years, but it grew twice that amount in the last five hundred, and twice more in the last two hundred, and twice more still in the last hundred until now a days where you only need wait a couple months for a major improvement to be made upon a machine that came out yesterday. It took a bit over 6,000 years from the time the word “civilization” can be accurately described to be formed in order to build the airplane in 1903. The moon landing occurred a little over 60 years later). You should realize by now just how quickly humans can potentially be overtaken by automated machines that do the job, not perfectly, but still better, than we do it.

&amp;#x200B;

“But that's a good thing!” you might say, stupidly, forgetting to address me with proper royal titles. “The more jobs machines do, the more human beings can focus on the BIG brain stuff or go into the arts!”

&amp;#x200B;

Oh ho ho ho ho, dear reader. Oh anime-girl-laugh indeed.

&amp;#x200B;

Human labor isn't just physical, it's also mental. Brain power, computation, imagination, all of these things go into intense calculations that allow for these machines to be built in the first place, that allow for architecture to be designed in the first place, that allow for people to decide on the very strains of food to grow in the first place. This is what is normally called 'white collar' work. Big brain stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I described it that way, brain power, computation, and calculation, it is nothing short of foolish to even suggest white collar jobs would be protected as mechanization advances infinitely onward. It is nothing short of foolish to suggest that robots couldn't possibly replace people in such thinky-thinky fields that every villainous robot in every sci-fi movie already ends up doing. People in such positions ALREADY rely heavily on computation to assist them in their practice, whether it's doctors, lawyers, bankers, brokers, politicians, teachers, or you, yes, just as you do.

&amp;#x200B;

“Ah! But creativity, Your Lordship! Creative fields shall remain untouched and humans can devote themselves to the arts!” some idealist will certainly say, hands clasped, gazing toward the sun. Unfortunately, dear idealist, I have some bad news for you: The Arts are already being replaced.

&amp;#x200B;

Pindar Van Arman is a programmer, featured on Vice, who is already uploading such software tools into his robots, not just allowing them Artificial Creativity, but allowing any robot with the software to do the same. The algorithm is called Style Transfer and works by showing the robot separate pieces of art, which it then puts together in its own unique style. Likewise, Cloudpainter is a software (used with a specific machine, obviously, not costing more than a few hundred dollars) that is able to not only create original art, but remember what it has previously painted and improve upon it, not just in artistic style, but even noting which types of paintings, materials, and styles sell the most, and replicating more and more of them. An A.I almost won the Nikkei Shinichi Hoshi Literary Award, a literary competition held in Japan. While it is worth noting that humans uploaded certain phrases and words for the A.I to use, as well as a framework for how the story would be, nigh the entire piece is the machine's own writing, and machines already excel in writing pieces with already firm frameworks and repeated phrases. An artificial intelligence machine developed by graduate student Mr.Valentin Kassarnig at the University of Massachusetts writes splendid political speeches, and Associated Press has partnered with the data-driven writing platform Automated Insights to begin automating quarterly earnings reports. AP now publishes 3,000 stories per quarter that were written by A.I programs.

&amp;#x200B;

Machines have even written music. Of particular note is one named Shimon, who is able to study large data-sets of notes, as well as the works of previous musicians, and then create its own completely original music; which it then plays. When originally created, Shimon was only intended to help 'improve' the music of musicians, helping them in their style, efficiency, to see what sells (noticing a pattern here?) but over improvements to its design, it gained the ability to create its own music, which, after being given a 'tick' or a groundwork of how the music should sound, is 100% Shimon and completely original (and also pretty good).

&amp;#x200B;

It's easy to scoff and turn away to remark that each of these A.I’s had human help, thus they will never 'truly' be creative, but at this point it is just wishful thinking. The human help is minor, and as we already discussed, automated machines improve drastically every single year (and indeed, this too is with the help of automated machines). But even that is not the biggest threat, for if you have ever entered the arts, whether painting, drawing, writing, or composing, you would know just how difficult it can be to create a full piece and, despite all your effort and good intentions, it could still be sub-par.

&amp;#x200B;

Machines do not get tired. They do not get sleepy. They do not need bathroom breaks. They do not sit and tap pencils to their lips as they wonder what in the hell they're going to do. They just do it.

&amp;#x200B;

They can carve out in hours what would otherwise take weeks, months, or even years to create; and they suffer no burn out either. They're able to keep working, working, and working, ad-infintinum, with completely new and original pieces, forever.

&amp;#x200B;

The one final refuge of human safety is in the fact that these inventions are still relatively new, and all of them, from the brawn, to brain, to artistic ability of these robots, only exists in very niche environments with very specific opportunities to be truly practical; but this too is quickly changing. Machines get cheaper every single year, on top of already being more practical in these niche specialties; and these 'niche specialties’ themselves are expanding as improvements are made. GPR's, or “General Purpose Robots” DO exist. They are not pre-programmed, instead learning as they watch humans, and with the right attachments, can do anything a human can with the only limitations being more finessed motor function; and though this may seem like an exaggeration, do keep in mind you are likely reading this ON a computer or phone, which is a General Purpose Machine, and think about just how vital computers are to the society we live in. All you need to do to change the specialty of a GPR is swap its software, and will, inevitably, be completely invaluable in the years to come, just as computers and cellphones are now.

&amp;#x200B;

A point must be made here too that the general course of technology is ALWAYS onward; you can’t just ‘not’ engage in it. Remember that cars were initially manufactured and sold as convenience machines, to get where you wanted to go faster, but it was never necessary to buy one in order to live a relatively stable or active life; and now entire cities are built around cars and their logistics. Already in many cities in the larger countries of the world, it is widely regarded as not just impractical, but outright IMPOSSIBLE to get around without a motorized vehicle of some sort. It is the same with computers; where once computers were created and advertised as convenience machines, things you did not NEED, but just made your job easier; it is now impossible for most businesses the world over to run without them, and if you do NOT use them, you are inevitably cut off from becoming a big business in the larger world. You can already see sprinklings of this in social media as well; wherein social media such as Facebook was once started with the intention to connect with long-distance friends, it is now 'expected' that people have social media when they go to find jobs, for it is to be checked, and it is considered highly suspicious to not have one; actively locking you out of many professions depending on the temperament of the interviewer.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there are some to suggest that this opening of the job market, you know, everyone getting fired and being replaced by robots, will just lead to better jobs for humans...but why? If a robot can already do everything you can do, and better, with just a change in Software, why would new positions opening due to innovation cause humans to be needed again? It wouldn't. Even if anything new opened up, it would be a hop, jump, skip to Tuesday where robots already filled the industry, again making humans useless once more. Historical patterns and recent growths (or lack-thereof) supports this, as where with every other technological boom, is was accompanied by an appropriate growth of new jobs and population, this is the first time in history where both new job creation and human population have not grown to match, and became stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe humans are purists and would rebel against this coming age, trusting only human work to do most of anything. But big corporations don't care about that, now do they? Remember, something doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better. Even if massive swaths of society rose up and boycotted massive mega-corps for its increasing reliance on GPR's, it wouldn't matter even a tiny bit if the massive decrease in their costs for hiring those GPR's (remember, robots don't even need to get paid) outweighed the profits lost from your boycott; and even if such a boycott WERE successful, you still have other nations who don't much care about pitiful little things like protests and would just go full-automation anyways, far outclassing anything the Western World could have in terms of output; even if, say, China and China alone went full automation, its growth in product and export, and the cheapness of it, would vastly outpace anything the rest of the world had to offer; forcing other nations to go full automation in order to remain economically viable, OR sinking into the dark.

&amp;#x200B;

The best way to pave way for the future is convenience. Convenience will always win out over anything but the most die-hard fans of the old way, and I tell you, dear reader, that these robots will become far more convenient than you. It is only a matter of time.

&amp;#x200B;

“So what” you might say, throwing up your arms. “So robots begin doing everything, all humans are now useless, but the economy is better than ever, with no want, no sickness, no famine, since robots do all the work and the prices are so low it would take mere pennies to buy enough of anything to feed three generations worth of family. There would be no need for labor, people only working if they so choose, and then spending the rest of their time doing whatever they pleased! This is fantastic!”

&amp;#x200B;

And you'd be absolutely right. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from the glaring flaw of having the government give out a living wage to every person in a nation, that is to say, being so stupid as to actually trust the government to give you money 'just because' when many governments the world over would already force you into a mold if they could. It is very likely that a UBI (Universal Basic Income) would be used as a ball and chain to keep people in line, with the threat of being denied your UBI as a deterrent to do anything a ruling party doesn't like, or not voting or performing as they would like. (Remember: The U.S is the only nation in the world with true freedom of speech, and even that is questionable, with many laws and bureaucratic orders to circumvent this and target people. In every other nation you can, and there are dozens of cases proving 'have', been put in jail for going against the grain of the ruling party's narrative, even in the first world), ideally, human corruption and incompetence aside, this sounds like a wonderful thing. Imagine! Never needing to work and having everything provided for you! Never having anything challenge you! Never needing to exert yourself for any reason! Just kind of...sitting around...waiting...for something...anything to happen...in a world that's fully automated...hm.

&amp;#x200B;

See, I believe the world is going to end, but I'm one of those weirdos who thinks it will end, not due to a meteor strike, or zombies, or even because the robots rise up. I believe the world will reach an emotional Armageddon. I believe there will eventually come a time where people just ask themselves “Why bother?”. People already do, don't they? People already wait, sit, hope, pray for anything interesting to happen, they pray for governments to collapse and war to start just so they have something to devote themselves to. They read and wish for adventure or play games to forget how bleak society seems. They talk about how they don't want to die, but instead wish that they had never been born. Brave New World, Brave New World, where bravery is never needed, where nobody has to do anything, and that uselessness, that stagnation, drives people to murder just to see a more vibrant colour than the vast grey concrete we have all around us.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine every aspiration you have becoming bunk, useless, pointless. Imagine your dream job, your dream hobbies, your dream life, but there is a machine that does each of them for you instead, more efficiently, and of a higher quality, and faster than you ever could. Indeed, why even bother? The only way for humans to avoid this fate is to listen to Mr. Musk and reach a synthesis, becoming half machine ourselves and evolving just as quickly; but that just brings into question what a human is, and indeed, if such a thing would even be desired at all; for yet again, why even bother, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Why bother doing anything other than waiting for the end to arrive.

&amp;#x200B;

So, you see, dear readers, this is why I fear for the future, as much as I fear the future itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the Apocalypse is already here.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's happening right now.

f75m70,Lavish_Bajaj,Is 3D printer technology for a better future?,"  

3D printing industry had a boom in year 2014. It’s still going great as of now, but is it really a future technology for a better and sustainable tomorrow? Is our future safe in 3D printing technology? Can we really develop everything i mean every single item which we use daily? 

So first of all for those who doesn’t know what 3D printing actually is, it’s a technology through which we can 3D print CAD (Computer Aided Designs) models in real life by using many types of filament. A filament meant here is a roll of a thermoplastic basically a material which can be heated easily and gets hardened on cooling instantly and provides strength. So if I talk about types of filament then we have 16 different types of it such as:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ABS Filament
2. PLA Filament
3. PET Filament
4. PETT Filament
5. Nylon Filament
6. PVA Filament
7. Sandstone Filament
8. Wood Filament
9. Metal Filament
10. HIPS Filament
11. Magnetic Iron Filament
12. Conductive Filament
13. Carbon Fibre Filament
14. TPE Filament
15. Glow in the Dark Filament
16. Amphora Filament

So I won’t be going into much detail about these filaments and let’s stick to the point whether 3D printing is really going to be a technology for tomorrow or not?

Just like the two sides of a coin 3D printers also have some advantages as well as some disadvantages. First of all 3D printing is not everyone’s job, 3D printing up to this date requires professionally trained people. It’s not as simple as conventional 2D printers where we give a command and within a few seconds we get a print on a paper. In 3D printing we need to take care a lot of things such as the support points of bed should be levelled, to check nozzle temperature according to the material used, paying attention to printer adjustment and maintenance, properties and nature of filament used, using support over hangings and many more. Then while printing one can face problems like the layer of material is not diffusing properly with each other, quality of parts printed and then cost of pre and post processing.

Well apart from these issues I personally love 3D printing and there are many reasons for it. 3D printing offers you rapid prototyping. There is no limit to 3D print objects that means it requires you to have imagination to print objects i.e. imagination is your limit! 3D printing also provides you faster production of your components than conventional manufacturing including injection moulds and subtractive production.  From a prototype to a final product, 3D printing tests ideas and designs quickly. Faster design and prototype production means more time to iterate the prototype and find product market fit before competitors. 3D printing production takes just hours. Conversely, testing ideas and designs with conventional manufacturing methods can take up days, if not several weeks.

3D printing provides better quality products as traditional manufacturing methods can easily result in poor designs, and therefore poor quality prototypes. 3D printing allows the step-by-step assembly of the object, which guarantees enhanced designs and eventually better quality objects. Apart from this it also enables you to customize your product according to your needs and taste; you can even create your own signature products!

However for common people it’s still out of reach. From designing to 3D printing one requires a skilled labour to do that it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. First issue comes out to be is the designing part. Trust me it’s not so easy to design even a smallest object in CAD software. If somehow we have a design still we can’t 3D print objects as we do in our 2D printers. Selection of filament is also a very important task and not much variety of filaments are available with us. 

Moreover if we talk about its cost then whole 3D printing machine is very costly and above that filament also costs a lot and then it requires a lot of effort to prepare design and 3D print them. Overall it’s very costly and requires a lot of skills. However apart from this 3D printing can contribute towards sustainable and ecofriendly future because some of the filaments used here are completely bio-degradable and are made from solid wastes. Moreover its material is completely re-usable.

So i believe that yes 3D printing a technology for the future but still many more advancements have to be done in this field. Many big players are already there advancing technology and stretching its limit still there is a lot more journey and challenges which we need to tackle. We can even think of living in a 3D printed house somewhere in future!",0,1582258264,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f75m70/is_3d_printer_technology_for_a_better_future/,Futurology,1

Don't believe me? Read for yourself: [https://4king.com/vr-reunited-a-mother-with-her-deceased-child/](https://4king.com/vr-reunited-a-mother-with-her-deceased-child/) 

While this is all very interesting there is no research into what the emotional impact of these meetings may be. Do you think connecting with one's religious leader would be a positive or negative thing? And do you think it is possible for people to accurately recreate these figures?",6,1582200278,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f6s44d/do_you_wanna_reconnect_with_your_religious_leader/,Futurology,1

It's not hard to imagine more powerful ones having enough range to take out missiles. The greatest sci-fi cliche is set to become reality with enormous implications for warfare and foreign policy. 

The laser's biggest advantage is the extremely low cost of each shot. The missiles of Israel's Iron Dome system each cost about $50,000. Lasers would change this, each burst would use just about $1 worth of electricity. Lasers do not run out of ammunition as long as they have a supply of electricity. Lasers are extremely precise as they will fire in a perfectly straight line rather than a missile which can go off course. Lasers travel at the speed of light, allowing instant interception no matter how fast the target is moving. 

All of this shifts the favor of battle to the defender. Right now, anti-ICBM missiles are easily fooled by decoys such as mylar balloons shaped like warheads. A laser would simply be able to destroy everything whether it be real or fake. It might make nuclear weapons, to quote Ronald Reagan, impotent and obsolete. It could make all manner of weapons obsolete. $1 worth of power to destroy an Abrams Tank ($4.3 million) or an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ($80 million). 

All in all, the laser may wind up being the most tremendous advance in weaponry since gunpowder.",44,1582091374,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f668y2/impact_of_lasers_on_warfare/,Futurology,1

f5zwzz,Spliqs,Spliqs Make Music with AI,"Hello Redditors!

We want to introduce you to Spliqs, a music creation app for iOS (iPhone and iPad) that gives you the power of creative musical brainstorming. Spliqs harnesses the magic of AI to help humans make music. Music is something people do, not just something we listen to, and we want to help people ""do music"" in new and exciting ways. To us, having a computer do all the work for you is boring. We don't want to be bored.

Our goal is to be at the forefront of the coming explosion of creative AI. AI will make music and visual art, produce films, write poetry, essays, and novels; it is only a matter of time. But all this content will be created autonomously, without human input or contact. At Spliqs, our AI will always work in service of the human creative element. That's in our company DNA.

Today we're looking for early adopters who resonate with what we're doing and can help us along the path to building a new generation of creative music tools.

In Spliqs, the experience starts by selecting an ""Inspiration"". We provide a set of starting points in the app, and more will come as we build the platform. If you know what MIDI is, you can AirDrop a MIDI file as an Inspiration, giving you the capacity to discover entirely new musical ideas from your own material. Once you have an ""Inspiration"", you select an ""Influence"" to morph together with your Inspiration, opening up a potentially huge space of musical possibilities. Some may be attractive to you and some may be a bit crazy; it's up to you to steer and explore this vast musical space and decide what works.

Currently the app is free but we are working on a premium model, with options for subscription or one-off purchase of different tweaking ""widgets"" and musical transformation tools. We'll also be offering optional ""packs"" of Inspirations and Instruments as we grow.

You can get the app here:

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spliqs/id1459170646](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spliqs/id1459170646)

And this is our website:

Please share, and subscribe at the bottom of the site so we can stay in touch. If you want to be added to our group of testers, just let us know!

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1792827121](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1792827121)

Having been trained as a Pharmacist, I was inspired to write my novel due to the great suffering of cancer patients: both at the hands of the disease and destructive therapies. With almost 2 million Canadian baby boomer cancer patients expected to die and the luckier 3.5 million survivors being cursed by chronic health conditions as a result of their treatments (not to mention cancer finding ways to resist even the newer immunotherapies given enough time) I believe it’s time to shift the cancer treatment paradigm into a new direction: non-destructive cures for cancer that reprogram mutations at the genetic level.

Instead of looking at cancer as a disease to be exterminated, shifting our perspective to viewing it like a mental disorder at the genetic level could be far more beneficial. Cancer’s only purpose in life is to grow and survive: by jeopardizing its existence, we are forcing it to dramatically evolve therapeutic resistance and progress out of control. Treating it non-destructively should prevent such desperate behaviours while simultaneously freeing our patients from experiencing current treatment consequences. More importantly though, if cancer can be cured non-destructively, it could open up a wealth of medical miracles (serving as infinitely replicable, patient-specific tissue that can be grown and stored in the lab for transplant usage). One day, if we treat cancer properly, it might end up being humanity’s ultimate saviour or even a cure.

My novel, Destructive Salvation, explores the theories and applications of a non-destructive, universal cancer cure in detail. Interweaved alongside a thrilling murder-mystery, Destructive Salvation is as much entertainment as it is an exploration of new ideas.

It’s time we stopped declaring war with our cells - or *selves*, as it were - because if we can find a proper cure to quelling discord at the genetic level, it’s possible we can translate that to our macroscopic lives.

f54fg5,ZealousidealScore4,Do you believe there will be technology or any means to bring back extinct species?,"Right now, they're trying to bring back the Wooly Mammoth via de-extinction, but I believe they have been doing this for a long time now. I don't think the technology we have right now is good enough to go about this process. I think in order to have this process to go smoothly it needs to be able to find a surrogate mother closely related to the species, but it also needs an environment in which the species existed in. I've done research on this, and there's a good chance that if we were to bring back extinct species, it wouldn't be the extinct species, but a hybrid of the surrogate mother and the extinct species. What do you think about ""playing God"" in this scenario? Do you think in the future we can bring back extinct species by any means or possibly create new species? It seems very far-fetched, but they have cloned Dolly the sheep via cloning procedures and processes. Shortly after the animal died. They also did this with the Iberian ibex. This species went extinct in 2000. They were able gather DNA and other genetic material to bring back the animal, but it also shortly died after. Given how far medical technology is going and how far technology is advancing, I do think it might be possible to bring back extinct species, but the only outcome would be that they would eventually die at some point, but as time goes on they could live longer enough to breed more of the species and through breeding processes, the species can thrive. Its fascinating, but it does pose some ethical concerns. Of course, it is important to protect the species we have today and I do believe de-extinction is also about preserving the genetic material of the species today so that we are able to bring them back if possible.",6,1581920283,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f54fg5/do_you_believe_there_will_be_technology_or_any/,Futurology,1

I would like to note that this advance does not require a quantum computer. In fact if they release this publicly anyone could use this technique on whatever hardware they have. It's just using a type of AI to watch simulations being done then it makes an emulation of that simulation. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator
The goal is to make it run faster without losing accuracy. The thing is it worked. There was no significant loss of accuracy and a significant increase in speed.

So we now have a system that can take really any input and create a realistic model of it that runs quickly. This is all before quantum computing goes mainstream. Which when it does that will be a whole other class of questions that are more commonly computable. This is all what within less then 2 decades of the original simulation hypothesis.

f50o8x,kernals12,Who'd Want to Live on Mars?,"Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have become mildly obsessed with building colonies on Mars. SpaceX has released [glossy depictions](https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-drops-details-for-spacexs-million-person-mars-mega-colony/) of a Martian City home to 1 million people. There's also talk about terraforming Mars to make it habitable for humans. My response to this is a simple ""what's the point?"". Even if Mars had a breathable atmosphere and some sort of artificial magnetosphere (highly speculative technology) it would still be a very undesirable piece of real estate. Travel times between earth and mars vary between 6 and 8 months. Any Mars colonist who wants to go back to earth to see family and friends better have *a lot* of vacation time accrued. And forget about phone calls or facetime, it takes 6 minutes for data to go round trip at the speed of light between the two planets. That makes normal conversation impossible. 

Mars' gravity is only 38% of Earth's, and no terraforming can fix that. Lower gravity means the muscles that hold you up don't have to work as hard and so they atrophy. Remember the chair people from Wall-E? Well that's what would happen to Mars colonists. 

Let's also consider the precedent of the inhospitable places on earth. Antarctica is completely empty except for a few dozen researchers who don't live there permanently. If we wanted to, we could build some domed cities there, but the demand is not high enough for any property developers to undertake that kind of project. The same thing is almost certain to be true for Mars. 

I think our priorities in space should focus on industrializing LEO and GEO. We'll probably wind up building orbital colonies to provide labor for the vast space economy that will certainly emerge. We could have outposts on the moon where lunar regolith will be used to manufacture satellites and probes. There might even be research stations on Mars with a handful of people living there on a non-permanent basis. But otherwise, we should cast out the ridiculous notion that huge numbers of people are going to colonize Mars.",117,1581902142,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f50o8x/whod_want_to_live_on_mars/,Futurology,1

f46m9r,hopeitwillgetbetter,Passive Desalination Record - 5.78 liters per sunlit hour per square meter (about 1.52 gallons per hour per 11 square feet) of solar collecting area.,"http://news.mit.edu/2020/passive-solar-powered-water-desalination-0207 - MIT claims they have broken the record (by more than twice).

&gt; The system delivered pure water that exceeded city drinking water standards, at a rate of 5.78 liters per square meter (about 1.52 gallons per 11 square feet) of solar collecting area. This is more than two times as much as the record amount previously produced by any such passive solar-powered desalination system, Wang says.

I'm not sure who was the previous record holder.  Perhaps?

https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/adqg8s/engineers_devised_a_new_prototype_to_desalinate/

&gt; up to 20 litres per day of drinking water per square meter exposed to the Sun (which comes out to around 2.5 liters per sunlit hour, assuming 8 hours per day)

Furthermore, MIT says:  

&gt; Unlike some desalination systems, there is **no accumulation of salt** or concentrated brines to be disposed of. In a free-floating configuration, any salt that accumulates during the day would simply be carried back out at night through the wicking material and back into the seawater, according to the researchers.

&gt; Their demonstration unit was **built mostly from inexpensive, readily available materials** such as a commercial black solar absorber and paper towels for a capillary wick to carry the water into contact with the solar absorber. In most other attempts to make passive solar desalination systems, the solar absorber material and the wicking material have been a single component, which requires specialized and expensive materials, Wang says. “We’ve been able to decouple these two.”

&gt; The most expensive component of the prototype is a layer of transparent aerogel used as an insulator at the top of the stack, but the team suggests other less expensive insulators could be used as an alternative. (The aerogel itself is made from dirt-cheap silica but requires specialized drying equipment for its manufacture.)

f364ki,auzeos,Let’s discuss the future.,"We’re just over two months into what has been a tumultuous start of a new decade. Everyone has to have thought at some point of what would the future could look like. Maybe you’ve painted a picture in your head of it recently. Let’s have a discussion in general about the bigger picture and theme of the future. This is how I see it, to float some ideas.  

The future could be dominated by industries. Governments would be bullied by them. The public interest would learn to serve the corporations. Spaceports will be home to commercial spaceships, which will take tourists to space and turn them into commercial astronauts. Hypersonic airships with large cabins will cut down travel times significantly. Getting halfway around the world could be done in a few hours. Companies like Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and Blue Origin could dominate this market. Shipping times will also become significant, as companies like Amazon take advantage and become the primary marketplace.


They will come closer to you and could even eventually sell your food. You will eat Amazon food daily, perhaps from Whole Foods or Walmart’s brand. Data will be sold between corporations and become a hot currency. Companies like Google will be the primary seller. Amazon could mine a lot of data from smart robots they bring to your home to assist you in daily tasks. This data could be used to feed your entertainment and interests. Massive investments into new shows, movies, sports, and the news become apart of the daily routine. These varieties will be streamed from a mobile phone, like Apple’s iPhone. It will have become high resolution, portable high end camera, gaming station, and most importantly a social networking and internet device. 5G and widespread broadband internet access will leave you streaming buffer free.


It will also get the word around fast, companies spread their image, and go on to develop fanbases. Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and Tesla merch is popular. Conveniently, the road will be dominated by electric vehicles as all major companies move to them and drive prices down. Popular early innovators like Tesla will dominate the market. The world will have become more environmentally conscious and concerned about their planet. Renewable and efficient energy will be widely used. Tesla could become major in this too.


As new diseases spread far and wide thanks to faster more efficient transportation, people become more concerned about their own health and access to healthcare. Pharmaceutical companies will have researched revolutionary drugs and establish monopolies. Prices will remain high or low and instead be funded by major insurance companies or governments. Vertex and Pfizer could be major contenders. Think of an insurance commercial. 

In your daily life you will be either getting educated or working or being rich enough to vacation. Those getting an education will fees into major education corporations and funneling money into colleges and university research. Those working be stuck working long perpetual labor, but make a decent enough living. Those with higher educations hope for a chance at success in the increasingly hierarchical societal structure. 


Every company has operated on building an exciting but expensive initial product. This product serves as funding for cheaper and more marketable improvements. Eventually, the product will have been so widespread that it will become part of your daily life.
We see it everywhere today. The car you drive, the airplanes you use to go to another country fast, the phone you use text on everyday, the smart speaker you ask the temperature each morning, every google search you make, all the time you spend streaming shows you stream, the need for insurance and expensive drugs,the last time you ordered something from Amazon, the frequency with which you visit Walmart, the last time you heard something about the Coronavirus or Trump.

f2txji,JollyRabbit,"Wait, wait, here me out. After having thought long and hard about the message of our Lord and Savior, the One True Son of God, Jesus Christ the Nazarine and the message laid forth by his Holy Apostle John in the Book of Revelations about the coming future of the world, the path forward is clear...","So what can we do to prepare?


Obviously there can be no doubt at all you godless Satan worshipping atheists that the Book of Revelations is true, as is the entire bible, after all the book itself says it is true.  You godless sinners had better take heed and prepare!


You are all in for some truly terrible times ahead.  Massive wars, earthquakes, the ocean turning to blood, giant monsters, rampaging armies of rape-demons, I think I saw something in there about flaming-corgis falling from the sky, but don't quote me on that part.  All of this is laid forth in the Book of Revelations so we KNOW it will happen!


So now do we get ready for this?


Obviously all terrestrial plans are futile since God will make this all come to pass.  


Thus the solution is clear.


We need to massively invest in the sciences and especially in space exploration so we can colonize other planets and escape from the weirdly jealous omnipott psychopath who is weirdly insecure and possessive about one tiiiiiiiiiny portion of the cosmos.  Since we know the Book of Revelations is literally true we have no choice but to evacuate the planet while God LARPs it up with Christian literalists because he is unconcerned with the rest of the universe!  After all, the Book of Revelations makes clear that this is all going to happen on Earth, so if we get out of here we should be fine!


Will O'Neill cylinders in Earth orbit be safe or do we need to go to Mars, maybe leave the solar system entirely to get away from this divine lunatic?



I say unto you sinners!  Repent!  Repent!  Repent for... not investing enough into NASA and properly funding basic scientific research!",6,1581525569,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/f2txji/wait_wait_here_me_out_after_having_thought_long/,Futurology,1

f2mmfy,robertjames70001,The BBC should be subscription only,"Do you really want a TV licence??

From the group ""Active Resistance to the TV Licence""

TO CANCEL YOUR TV LICENCE

1. Contact TVL, inform them that you no longer require a licence. 
They will push you for a reason but there is NO requirement to go further than this. 
Be persistent. 
You can also do this online, or see below for the phone number.

2. Wait for the barrage of threatening letters. 
Any letters you get sent from TV LICENSING, put these in the bin, as they are computer generated. 
You, and millions of others receive these letters daily.

IF THEY VISIT

Always ask any stranger at your door, who they are. If they do, (or do not) state who they are, simply say, ""NOT INTERESTED"" and close your door. 
Do not sign any PAPERWORK, as this is your way forward to a court hearing and a fine if you do sign.
There is NO legal or lawful obligation to speak to these people. Keep the interaction with any stranger as short as possible.

LETTERS WITH YOUR NAME ON IT

If you are receiving threatening letters with your name on them, or the letters were addressed to the legal occupier, but now have your name on them, throw them in the bin. 
It doesn't matter if they have your name, as they can acquire your name through 3rd party services. 
What they solely rely on is a signature that they will try to get from you when they visit. 
That is why it is important that you do NOT sign any PAPERWORK!.

SEARCH WARRANTS

TVL have been known, to apply for SEARCH WARRANTS. 90% of the time, they will get refused by a judge. 
To avoid being on the butt end of one of these rare WARRANTS, it is important that you do not send their letters back to them, especially with insulting messages written on them. 
Do not remove their visit rights, just simply turn strangers away from your door. 
Some people like to send TVL a removal of rights letter. 
Any letters you send to TVL, will be stored away for future evidence and this coupled with the visits will strengthen their case if they do apply for a warrant. 
This also includes insulting them if they visit, it is all recorded.

DO NOT WORRY about the POLICE. They do not enforce the licence fee. They only attend the execution of a VERY RARE search warrant to PREVENT A BREACH OF THE PEACE.

IF YOU HAVE SKY/VIRGIN ETC

Your contracts are secure and TVL cannot obtain info from them (due to data protection laws). 
This will be a breach your contract with these providers. 

CAN THEY TAKE YOU TO COURT WITH YOUR NAME?

No they cannot. 
What they need, is a signature, on a form to do this.

MYTH BUSTING

TV detector vans do not exist. 
These are a myth, to keep you paying for your licence. BBC have no way of knowing what you watch on TV. 
If they knew then these goons would never need to visit your home. 
Food for thought!

HANDHELD DEVICES

These are not TV detecting equipment. 
They are PDA'S that tell the person who lives at the address and shows them, as having, or not having a licence, that is it. 
Goons have been known to tell people that their PDA'S detect TV equipment. 
This is pure lies.

Do they know I am watching TV when I switch it on. 
Quite simply ..... NO!

TVL detection equipment has NEVER been used as evidence in a court room. 
Another common myth to intimidate people into paying.

TAKE NOTE .....

Anyone on the payment scheme, MUST also cancel this scheme. 
This is a contract with TVL. 
Make sure you are in advance with payments first, before you cancel. 
This also applies to direct debit payments. Never cancel your DD first, as this does not cancel your licence and will only put you further into debt. 
It is important that you cancel your, licence first, then the DD. If on the other hand you buy the licence outright, then let it run it's course and have no further contact after.

Always remember we are here to help you all and should you not want to speak out on the page, please message us anytime with any problems you have about Capita or TVL. 
We will get back to you, usually within 24 hrs, depending on current message times.

IF YOU GET A SUMMONS, CONTACT US STRAIGHT AWAY!

The idea is that the beam acts as a condensation nuclei around which clouds will form. In the 80s, [Bernard Eastlund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdLV3YRMvw), an MIT trained physicist and director of research at the oil company ARCO, suggested that a gigantic field of Ionizing Antennae could control the weather, consuming 100 GW of power (that's about 10% of US annual electricity generating capacity). The idea was too big to be realistic, but a much smaller version was built, called HAARP, spawning endless conspiracy theories. With extremely low cost solar power on the horizon, it may be time to take these ideas seriously.

We're worried about extreme weather from climate change, but if we could control the weather we could easily mitigate these effects and then some. We could, for example, move some of the heavy rainfall from Oregon and Washington to the arid Rocky Mountains. Maybe we could recreate [Lake Lahontan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lahontan), providing waterfront property in the middle of Nevada.

[Eavor signs deal with Yukon First Nation for geothermal project](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/carmacks-geothermal-project-eavor-loop-1.5446828)

[Eavor website](https://eavor.com/)

I've been following Eavor for several months, ever since they finished construction of their demonstration site in Alberta (I professionally cover news for the oil and gas industry, but have been increasingly adding coverage of the energy transition and renewables as the industry begins to pivot in that direction more and more). Eavor recently received 3rd party validation proving the technology works and are already looking at building their first commercial units beginning next year. It's essentially a radiator. Where traditional geothermal energy produces hot brine from subsurface reservoirs, Eavor extracts heat by circulating a proprietary fluid through a giant loop that is kilometers deep. They create the loop by drilling multi-lateral wells and connecting the toes (end of the lateral or horizontal sections) and then installing a pipe.

It's still early days, but this seems like it could be a real game changer. The first project in the Yukon is only going to generate 3 MW to begin with, and will cost $30 million to install. But if you believe the CEO, the technology could eventually be scaled to 3 GW. Experience and economies of scale ought to bring the investment cost down in the future as well (I would assume). Many traditional gas- or coal-fired power plants don't even have a 1 GW nameplate capacity, and the largest nuclear plant has a 4 GW capacity. I hope the tech is as good as they say it is, its really exciting.",0,1581014810,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ezwu2m/eavor_geothermal_demonstration_project_receives/,Futurology,1

eyp6gd,Juno56,"Earth in 100-200 years from now, possibly more?","Here's how I view it (Note that I'm 17, so I'm probably uneducated about a lot of things, if I sound ignorant, please feel free to correct me) Global Warming and Climate Change will take a toll. From what I've learned a lot of it has to do with heating up the planet more, as the global temperature will be higher by then compared to now, from what I've learned this causes a lot of issues for some animals, as they need to move to less intense areas to survive, this not only kills off more animals, but limits their options for survival as well. 

In 100-200 years from now I believe Antarctica will be pretty much gone, or at least most of it will be. This will kill off a lot of polar life, and while us humans being all snug and cozy with our blankets and houses might not be too affected by this, it's still a big thing to happen and is certainly not a good thing regardless. 

AI will become more apparent and prevalent, that one is obvious. But I'm really hoping they don't give AI personalities or self awareness/sentence/consciousness, because if androids and robots do get that kind of thing then we're at possible risk for AI dominating the planet, either through force and war, or through making humans obselete and eventually useless and having no reason to stick around. This sounds far fetched but it can happen imo, I think having machines and robots as assistance would make tons of peoples lives much easier, but we shouldn't  let them take over entirely. Give them enough intelligence to help with more complicated tasks, but not enough to where they get any ideas or sentience of their own, that could be dangerous. 

Theres a lot more that could happen, but those are the first things that come to mind for me, what what about you guys?",24,1580818497,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eyp6gd/earth_in_100200_years_from_now_possibly_more/,Futurology,1

eynhgu,mofugami,What happened to Claytronics? Self-reconfigurable Modular Robots?,"There was some research about a technology called 'Claytronics' at CMU back in somewhere around 2007. Does anyone know what happened to it? They stopped updating any info on the CMU webpage a long time ago, and the Intel webpage for it is a dead link. It was no where near completion and it had such an ambitious future ahead. 
I'm very curious of what happened to it because I was a fond of the idea so much that it convinced me to pursue engineering 10 years ago and was hoping to join the research if it was ongoing, but now there's barely anything about it that i can find on the internet. Not just CMU's claytronics, but just self-reconfigurable modular robotics as a whole. Has it lost it's worth of development over other rising technologies?
Anyways, here's a link to CMU's webpage about the technology if anyone's interested. It hasn't been updated for 10 years.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics

I'd appreciate it if anyone knows what happened would share it here, or if there's any research similar to this being done recently, or your thoughts about the demand of this technology now that it's 2020 and this research happened more than 10 years ago.",1,1580807876,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eynhgu/what_happened_to_claytronics_selfreconfigurable/,Futurology,1

eyb870,kernals12,Why Shared Driverless Cars Probably Won't Catch On,"There's a theory going around that once driverless cars arrive, we won't own them, instead we'll hail them like cabs. To venture capitalists and technology journalists, this sounds awesome, no more need for parking spaces! Except, as I'll show here, this idea has a lot of problems.

Let's start with the parking issue. Promoters of the shared driverless car idea point out that a regular car spends 95% of its time parked and wouldn't it be great if we didn't need any parking lots? Except, shared driverless cars will need to be parked. 

As you can see [here](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/tmguide/tmg_2013/traffic-monitoring-theory.cfm) (scroll down to 1-2), traffic is not constant. Fleets of driverless cabs will need to be big enough to meet demand during the evening rush hour. But throughout the typical weekday, traffic only averages about just over half that level (not counting the lower demand on weekends), unless huge numbers of empty cabs are going to roam the streets at 3 in the morning, they'll need to be parked for that other half of the time. So that means the parking required drops by only 50%, which is not enough to eliminate our biggest parking lots and garages. Besides, parking is not very expensive to provide, if it were, Wal-Mart would charge for it. 

If you go everywhere by cab, you won't save much money. A  driverless cab doing 28,000 miles per year will cost, over its lifetime, just as much as a personal car doing 14,000 miles in terms of insurance, financing, maintenance, registration fees and fuel. Depreciation will be slightly lower, but the cab company will have its own costs in terms of overhead and profit. And there's a tried and tested way to avoid depreciation already: buy a used car.

Let's also consider the inconveniences that this will bring. Having to wait 10 minutes for a driverless cab to show up when you want to go to the grocery store will be extremely annoying. You lose a place to stow sunglasses, umbrellas, and grocery bags. And it's inevitable these cabs will get covered in vomit, urine, and semen. 

With all of that, I think most of us will stick with buying or leasing our own cars.",87,1580753792,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eyb870/why_shared_driverless_cars_probably_wont_catch_on/,Futurology,1

exevou,Memetic1,Can you utilize the fact that sound has negative mass to create a warp drive?,"I've been running the numbers and it doesn't take an infeasible amount of energy to create pounds of negative mass. Here are some semi organized notes I took on the sort of power we are talking about.

1 Watt is .1 milligrams

https://resonance.is/sound-has-mass-and-thus-gravity/

.1milligrams × 230 pounds = 104.326245 megawatts of energy

104326245 Milligrams in 230 pounds

1 pound would take 453.592 kilowatts 

https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&amp;t=3

average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,972 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of about 914 kWh per month. 

I could see one part of the ship hull having sound pushed threw it to create that negative mass. Then you would switch to a different part of the craft to create motion. Kind of like pushing against the fabric of space itself. If you kept alternating between say the front of the craft, and the rear you might create thrust.

I know this sounds kind of out there but think about what might be possible if we can harness negative mass.",37,1580600572,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/exevou/can_you_utilize_the_fact_that_sound_has_negative/,Futurology,1

ewsdwx,NiNkox,Thought to text - thought controled phone,"Thought to Text - Are you all ready to be Wizards? Well, kinda. [brain dump]

“Thought to text” Tech - Where does it go??

Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and more are working on a device that will do “thought to text”... can you imagine? If you can type with your thoughts? If you can think a word and it pops on the screen. This device will scan your brain 100 times a second. When you think of something, thousands connections are being made in your brain creating a pattern/map. After using the device for a while the computer will learn what patterns are present when you think about certain things. These patterns then can be used. Your going to be able to do a lot more than text a word. You could be able to think then say those words into a program designed to do an action based on what words are said. Like thinking “click” would click the button on your screen. This would easily lead into controlling your phone with your thoughts. If you can control the phone, your patterns can be mapped to even control other things like artificial limbs. Thinking a direction tells the computer to move in that direction based on the scanned image of your brain.

Now what? this?
I’m now standing in front of you, I want to say hello, I think “hello”. The brain is then scanned by the device, “hello” is then sent to you via messenger, which then shows up in front of you, because your wearing the contact lenses tech companies are working on. The heads up display screen in your eye like augmented reality.

Are we NOT telepathic cyborgs now? LOL

Right now the top intelligent things on earth are communicating with very low band width connectors. Humans and computers... our thumbs right now is our bandwidth. We can only get so much data from our brains, through our thumbs, into our phones/computers. 

Billions are being pumped into this under the radar, the first to do it will be king. It will revolutionize the world. The whole world works on a 56k modem... data by manual entry (fingers). Remember what happened to the world when it went from 56k modems to Fiber optic? 

The power it would hold as a personal assistant cannot be understated, paired with a wireless ear bud, driving home and think to your car to “open  garage” and then to  Walk inside, think “lock doors”. It’s dark “lights”, “turn on playlist” music starts playing.  Your whole surroundings, every smart device in your house is now under your thought control. Your a fucking wizard! 

With the ear bud, contact lens, and brain scanning you could be standing there in a empty room, think call your sister, you will be able to see and hear her and talk without moving a muscle. 

Oh my god, I just thought of another thing. You could sing lyrics in your head to any beat. This tech could change the music industry... Lyric writing programs. (Start building app based on tech that’s not there yet?)

Would we be able to get rid of phones all together? A smart watch could be worn for the processing power and the screen is in your eye.

This all sounds like a sci-fi movie but it could be just years away... through history, society can be categorized  into periods or ages.  Industrial Age &lt; machine age &lt; atomic age &lt; digital revolution &lt; space age &lt; Information Age (now)

To me it feels like a race to be the first one to connect a human brain to a computer. Better start filling out those idea patents I thought. I did a patent search for thought control.  Google, Microsoft, and many universities have that area locked up. Microsoft went as far as to try and patent the phrase “mind control”.",1,1580494290,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ewsdwx/thought_to_text_thought_controled_phone/,Futurology,1

ewrj8l,kernals12,Why I am Confident Climate Change Will Not Kill Us All,"Amsterdam and Phoenix are two extremely different cities. But what they have in common is they are living testament to humanity's resilience against the harshest conditions Mother Nature has to throw at us and show that life will go on even if the earth gets hotter.

Amsterdam sits below sea level, as does much of the Netherlands as you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/3nhr02/the_netherlands_vs_the_netherlands_without_dikes/). But thanks to an elaborate system of dikes, Amsterdam's picturesque rowhouses remain dry. The city currently sits about 2 meters below sea level. Estimates are 3 degrees C of warming from preindustrial levels, which is what we're probably headed for, will make sea levels rise by just under [50 centimeters by 2100](http://www.mathtube.org/sites/default/files/slides/UBC.pdf). Dikes will be sufficient to keep most of our great cities high and dry for the foreseeable future. You might claim that there's no way poor countries like Bangladesh could pay for this, but the Dutch built most of their dikes centuries ago when they were poorer than sub-saharan Africa is today.

Phoenix's average high temperatures during the summer are over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Even with climate change, very few places will experience conditions approaching this. But Phoenix and its suburbs are now home to 4.7 million people. And they take the sweltering summers in stride, finding shelter in the air conditioned confines of their homes, cars, offices, and shopping malls. Given economic growth, it is reasonable to assume that by mid century, most residents of the places projected to become dangerously warm in the summer will be able to afford air conditioning and the residents of New Delhi will live like today's Phoenicians. 

You may be worried about food supplies, but the ability of science to improve food production is almost certain to be a greater factor than climate change. We can create crops suited to potentially harsher conditions. The pests that will have greater opportunity to spread without frost killing them off can be wiped out with gene drives. And more heat means that land in Canada and Siberia could become arable. Finally, the potential for synthetic food must be considered. Cellular agriculture has made great strides and will soon allow food production to be totally separated from the farm. 

We can see our resilience in many places. Natural disasters have become [much less deadly](https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters). Rising temperatures have been irrelevant in the face of sturdier buildings, reliable weather forecasting, and the erection of dams that reduce the occurrence of droughts and floods. 

We must also consider the deaths that climate change will prevent. Everyone, except the skiing industry, will benefit from reduced snowfall. Fewer people will have heart attacks from shoveling snow,  ambulances will be blocked less often by snow, and there will be fewer accidents caused by slippery roads. These are real benefits that must be measured against the negatives.

And life on earth has been through much hotter conditions. In the Cretaceous period, temperatures were a whopping 10 degrees C higher than they are now. There were palm trees in the arctic circle. Life thrived and earth did not turn into a Venus-style hothouse. 

To be sure, climate change will bring problems, but you can rest easy knowing that life will not end because of it. And claiming that it will does not help anyone and winds up making you look crazy.",77,1580490816,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ewrj8l/why_i_am_confident_climate_change_will_not_kill/,Futurology,1

We would then mix that graphene into the mixture of sand / algea and gelatin

Apparently gelatin is strengthened by adding graphene to it.

We could mine the moon for the sand bit, and get co2 from Venus in the process making it easier to terraform Venus. So really in order to make more of this stuff you just need something equivalent to Gelatin that can be manufactured on site.
Thus you could grow space ships in space. The walls would naturally pull the co2 from the air, and use that to heal any damage. These bricks can also be engineered to do stuff like glow when they are damaged for easy repair. Patching damage would be as easy as slathering some more on.

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;— **I talked to him for a while about genetic reprogramming.** He doesn’t buy the efficacy of typical anti-aging technology efforts, because he believes humans have general expiration dates, and no one fix can help that. He explained: “The whole system is collapsing. You don’t see someone who’s 90 years old and it’s like, they can run super fast but their eyesight is bad. The *whole system* is shutting down. In order to change that in a serious way, you need to reprogram the genetics or replace every cell in the body.” Now with anyone else—literally *anyone* else—I would shrug and agree, since he made a good point. But this was Elon Musk, and Elon Musk *fixes shit for humanity.* So what did I do?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Well…but isn’t this important enough to try? Is this something you’d ever turn your attention to?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Elon:** The thing is that all the geneticists have agreed not to reprogram human DNA. So you have to fight not a technical battle but a moral battle.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** You’re fighting a lot of battles. You could set up your own thing. The geneticists who are interested—you bring them here. You create a laboratory, and you could change everything.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Elon:** You know, I call it the Hitler Problem. Hitler was all about creating the Übermensch and genetic purity, and it’s like—how do you avoid the Hitler Problem? I don’t know.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** I think there’s a way. You’ve said before about Henry Ford that he always just found a way around any obstacle, and you do the same thing, you always find a way. And I just think that that’s as important and ambitious a mission as your other things, and I think it’s worth fighting for a way, somehow, around moral issues, around other things.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Elon:** I mean I do think there’s…in order to fundamentally solve a lot of these issues, we are going to have to reprogram our DNA. That’s the only way to do it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** And deep down, DNA is just a physical material.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Elon:** \[Nods, then pauses as he looks over my shoulder in a daze\] It’s software.  
&gt;  
&gt;Comments:

1. It’s really funny to brashly pressure Elon Musk to take on yet another seemingly-insurmountable task and to act a little disappointed in him that he’s not currently doing it, when he’s already doing more for humanity than literally anyone on the planet.
2. It’s also super fun to casually brush off the moral issues around genetic programming with “I think there’s a way” and to refer to \*DNA—\*literally the smallest and most complex substance ever—as “just a physical material deep down” when I have absolutely no idea what I’m talking about. Because those things will be his problem to figure out, not mine.
3. I think I’ve successfully planted the seed. If Musk takes on human genetics 15 years from now and we all end up living to 250 because of it, you all owe me a drink.",35,1580290241,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/evkpii/elon_musk_on_longevity_research/,Futurology,1

evetn1,McDinaldo,What could infantry weapons look like in 100 years?,"Hello, everyone! This is my first post on this sub, so forgive me if I am long-winded or make any mistakes. Also, forgive my lack of military knowledge.

This is a very broad topic and I would like to see some open discussion, but some specific things I'm wondering about involve the development of lighter, stronger (liquid?) body armour, as well as military exoskeletons.

In my mind, these two technologies simultaneously make soldiers harder to kill, and reduce the effects of weight and recoil when considering weapon caliber, rate of fire and ammunition.

Is this true? If so, will the soldiers of the future just carry bigger guns?

Could we also see changes in firearm propellant technology, or are we stuck with Ye Olde Gunpowder for the foreseeable future?

With only a modest investment of time &amp; energy, anyone could greatly augment their ability to process information (ie Think). The internet amplified that again by orders of magnitude.

eubm5q,CasualPteranodons,What will be the incentive for working more than the bare minimum required to survive once VR becomes immersive enough to fulfill (almost) all needs?,"I'm basically picturing something like Ready Player One. Why do people still work more than the bare minimum? If they can afford a house, food, and a VR Headset, what else would they work for? 

Right now there are some needs that can be fulfilled in VR. However, they are still not comparable to their real-life equivalents. You can get some social interaction, but not all your social interaction in VR. You can get some sense of accomplishment by doing things in VR, but not as much as you get by doing things in real-life. Let's say the amount of needs you can fulfill in VR right now is 5%. Now you have to do things in real life because VR simply won't make you fulfilled.

But what if that becomes 50%? What if social interaction in VR becomes good enough that you can build long-term relationships in VR, have real friends in VR, and all your social needs can be fulfilled through VR? You wouldn't really have to leave VR that much, as social interaction through VR would be way easier, it would allow you to search for people with more specific common interests, it would be better.

If it becomes 90%, will anyone have to leave VR for anything besides making sure they have money to stay in VR? Why spend money on real paint and expensive canvasses if you can buy a paint simulator for $20 and paint as much as you want, with it feeling as real as painting on a physical canvas? Why travel, when you can explore hand-crafted 3d landscapes and cities that are bigger and more beautiful than anything that exists in real life? I believe VR will almost certainly become this immersive before the end of this decade.

Now the real problem. What if it becomes 100%? This is probably more than a decade away from becoming cheap and common consumer tech, but full VR suits with electrical stimulation to simulate physically interacting with the VR world already exist. There are also devices that let you walk/run while stationary so you are no longer confined to the space you are doing VR in. At that point there is literally no benefit to doing something in real life. Couple this with electronic sex devices and you could also remotely have sex with someone while feeling as if you're really having sex. At that point, what becomes the incentive for doing anything outside VR that isn't needed to support your VR lifestyle? Earning money to pay rent and electricity bills, buying food, and working out are the only things I can think of. How would a society function like this? If the money needed to be in VR all the time is the only money you'll ever need, why would anyone work more than the bare minimum?",44,1580067774,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eubm5q/what_will_be_the_incentive_for_working_more_than/,Futurology,1

eu621k,Lemillion1o,First hyper loop in India,"The government of the Indian state of Maharashtra has approved Virgin Hyperloop One's plans to develop a high-speed line between Mumbai and Pune, which could become the world's first hyperloop.

Maharashtra's government has announced that a consortium of Virgin Hyperloop One and global ports owner DP World would be the preferred operator to build ""the first hyperloop transportation system in the world"".

The planned hyperloop line will connect the two cities in western India, which are around 100 miles apart, in 35 minutes. This would be a drastic reduction on current travel times of three and a half hours by car.

Line planned as world's first

""Maharashtra will create the first hyperloop transportation system in the world and a global hyperloop supply chain starting from Pune,"" announced Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra.

""We have just named the DP World – Virgin Hyperloop One consortium as the original project proponent for the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project and [are] preparing to start the public procurement process,"" he continued.

""Maharashtra and India is at the forefront of hyperloop infrastructure building now and this is a moment of pride for our people.""


Numerous routes are currently competing to be the world's first operable hyperloop system. Virgin Hyperloop One is also planning a system to link Dubai and Abu Dhabi, while Elon Musk's infrastructure firm The Boring Company has permission to begin digging a tunnel in Washington DC to connect the city with New York.

Another system has been proposed in Europe by Hardt Hyperloop, for which UNStudio has envisioned a series of modular stations, while a line to link Mexico City to Guadalajara in Mexico is also under development.

""India firmly in the lead"" in race to build first hyperloop

According to Virgin Hyperloop One, the announcement from the Maharashtra government has put India in the pole position to build the first hyperloop line.

""This is history in the making,"" said Jay Walder, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop One. ""The race is on to host the first hyperloop transportation system in the world, and today's announcement puts India firmly in the lead.

""This is a significant milestone and the first of many important steps toward bringing hyperloop to the masses,"" he added.

Hyperloop technology was conceived by Musk in 2013. The systems would project pods at near-supersonic speeds through partially depressurised tubes. Proponents of the technology believe that it could be used to create a high-speed public transport alternative to trains and planes.

Virgin Hyperloop One is one of several companies vying to develop the technology. The company was established in 2014 to develop the hyperloop, with Richard Branson becoming a mayor investor leading to the company being renamed in 2017.

Along with passenger systems the Virgin Hyperloop One has also collaborated with DP World and Foster + Partners to create a vision of a cargo hyperloop network.",2,1580041384,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/eu621k/first_hyper_loop_in_india/,Futurology,1

and only allow people with a certain score to have children, the minimum score doesn't have to be high just higher than what we would consider a disability also the score only considers birth traits and not attained ones, while stoping people from having children might sound harsh it is the same reason we stop incest it is better for the children.

It's called a [Gene Drive](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02087-5). It involves breeding huge numbers of genetically modified insects that when introduced to the wild, will produce sterile offspring, eventually wiping out the species. 

This means that the days when ravenous insects could spread disease, destroy crops, and damage property with impunity are coming to a close. 

The mosquitoes that kill 1 million people every year through malaria and dengue will be gone. So too will the locusts that wreak havoc on crops. As will the pine beetles that are currently destroying forests across North America, leaving behind rotten trees that make ideal fuel for wildfires. 

Unlike chemical pesticides, these gene drives do not harm other wildlife and there's no chance of the target insect becoming resistant, which is what did in DDT. 

Eventually, we could do the same thing to larger animals. Mice and rats could be eliminated, as well as all manner of invasive species. 

This ability to bring pests to heel will mark yet another important step in our ability to make nature bend to our whim with great benefits for all.",18,1579836754,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/et4mis/the_end_of_pests/,Futurology,1

esqdwm,NiNkox,"Thought to Text - Are you all ready to be Wizards? Well, kinda. [brain dump]","“Thought to text” Tech - Where does it go??

Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and more are working on a device that will do “thought to text”... can you imagine? If you can type with your thoughts? If you can think a word and it pops on the screen. This device will scan your brain 100 times a second. When you think of something, thousands connections are being made in your brain creating a pattern/map. After using the device for a while the computer will learn what patterns are present when you think about certain things. These patterns then can be used. Your going to be able to do a lot more than text a word. You could be able to think then say those words into a program designed to do an action based on what words are said. Like thinking “click” would click the button on your screen. This would easily lead into controlling your phone with your thoughts. If you can control the phone, your patterns can be mapped to even control other things like artificial limbs. Thinking a direction tells the computer to move in that direction based on the scanned image of your brain.

Now what? this?
I’m now standing in front of you, I want to say hello, I think “hello”. The brain is then scanned by the device, “hello” is then sent to you via messenger, which then shows up in front of you, because your wearing the contact lenses tech companies are working on. The heads up display screen in your eye like augmented reality.

Are we NOT telepathic cyborgs now? LOL

Right now the top intelligent things on earth are communicating with very low band width connectors. Humans and computers... our thumbs right now is our bandwidth. We can only get so much data from our brains, through our thumbs, into our phones/computers. 

Billions are being pumped into this under the radar, the first to do it will be king. It will revolutionize the world. The whole world works on a 56k modem... data by manual entry (fingers). Remember what happened to the world when it went from 56k modems to Fiber optic? 

The power it would hold as a personal assistant cannot be understated, paired with a wireless ear bud, driving home and think to your car to “open  garage” and then to  Walk inside, think “lock doors”. It’s dark “lights”, “turn on playlist” music starts playing.  Your whole surroundings, every smart device in your house is now under your thought control. Your a fucking wizard! 

With the ear bud, contact lens, and brain scanning you could be standing there in a empty room, think call your sister, you will be able to see and hear her and talk without moving a muscle. 

Oh my god, I just thought of another thing. You could sing lyrics in your head to any beat. This tech could change the music industry... Lyric writing programs. (Start building app based on tech that’s not there yet?)

Would we be able to get rid of phones all together? A smart watch could be worn for the processing power and the screen is in your eye.

This all sounds like a sci-fi movie but it could be just years away... through history, society can be categorized  into periods or ages.  Industrial Age &lt; machine age &lt; atomic age &lt; digital revolution &lt; space age &lt; Information Age (now)

To me it feels like a race to be the first one to connect a human brain to a computer. Better start filling out those idea patents I thought. I did a patent search for thought control.  Google, Microsoft, and many universities have that area locked up. Microsoft went as far as to try and patent the phrase “mind control”.",0,1579769000,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/esqdwm/thought_to_text_are_you_all_ready_to_be_wizards/,Futurology,1

I've read a lot on this subject and it seems that that safety is the biggest roadblock(no pup intended)

Anyways it seems that some people want 100% safety; before launch. In my mind this will never happen. If the that is the standard 100% we will happen rear 100% safety, if all cars were self driving you can't promise that all live will be saved that means self driving cars will never be deployed.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts on this.

Think we will have to accept that some humans will die. Such as when they fly a plane etc you get the point. As long ad Level 5 driverless cars are as safe as humans.

Elon says that he plans to have 1 million people on Mars by 2050. 1,000 Starships will be launched every 26 months (Earth-Mars transfer window) over a period of 30 days (so an average of 33 starships a day). Each starship will carry 100 passengers, so thats 100,000 passengers to Mars every 26 months (or 1 million passengers total over 21.6 years).

Seems exciting, I'm just surprised that 1,000 starships will go to Mars every 2 years. That seems ridiculously fast, its basically 38 starships being made from scratch, and filled to the brim with cargo and people/whatever every MONTH for 26 months. What the fuck..

erpp6q,super13z,Theoretically would we achieve sentient AI or send someone to mars first?,"Hi, I recently started a debate with my friend again over whether or not sentient AI or getting a human to mars is more feasible. This started after Elon Musk claimed we needed legislation to have clear guidelines for the creation of AI. I will just outline some of the general issues on either side although I am by no means an expert in these categories so feel free to offer other possibilities or challenges, thats why we are here.

Limitations of AI development: 

Computation power: I think that quantum computers show promise in the area of AI, however there is no guarantee this will allow for complex thinking.

Scale: Creating an AI to integrate into society it would ideally be able to exist in a space approximately the size of a large person, although digital complex AI would be the first step. 

Plausibility: Safely creating an AI that has the ability to think on its own without any guidelines while also holding it accountable and making it act in ways that are acceptable by society

Evaluation; Ways to quantify sentience and to test the ability to be indistinguishable from a person

Limitations of getting a human to mars:

Food: To send a human to mars they would require food on their spacecraft or mechanisms to deliver food to them. The former suffers the issue of over a years worth of food being needed. This would be a lot of weight and space

Fuel: A spacecraft capable of getting to mars would probably need multiple refuelings by unmanned spacecrafts although this is feasible, it is another area of concern",14,1579582266,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/erpp6q/theoretically_would_we_achieve_sentient_ai_or/,Futurology,1
