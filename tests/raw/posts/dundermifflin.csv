fso8qh,R0gueBadger,Need help finding a mediated example from The Office for an online class discussion.,"Hi all,

So I'm taking an *Introduction to Communications* class and for a discussion board post (because everything's discussion boards now) I need to provide a ""mediated"" response to a topic. For some context, I'm choosing the context of Self-Disclosure and its limitations. For those who don't know, self-disclosure is when you reveal personal information about yourself to others, as a means of building a relationship, be it among co-workers, new friends, etc. 

With that, I am desperately trying to find any example of when Michael or Dwight might have self-disclosed a little too much, but I'm drawing a blank. 

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.",9,1585698416,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fso8qh/need_help_finding_a_mediated_example_from_the/,DunderMifflin,1

Michael was incompetent. Jim never really was truly a boss. Charles minor was a substitute. Dwight shot a gun. Andy skipped pretty much only got things done when Robert was in town. When Wallace took over, he basically just skipped town. And Dwight fired Kevin once he became permanent manager. Thats just unforgivable.

The only one that comes close to being as good as California is Creed, but he was only boss for 2 days, so its hard to judge him on that.",6,1585684035,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fsjtje/unpopular_opinion_robert_california_was_the_best/,DunderMifflin,0

fsek1s,StructuralPhase,Are American companies really unruly like Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch?,"I'm asking after watching Season 6, Episode 3 The Promotion. 

When Jim announces unequal pay raise plan, all the office employees who are not in sales department stand up and raise their voice for opposition. 

I cannot imagine how this could happen in real life. I am from Korea, so maybe this is a cultural thing, but I am baffled how everyone dares to immediately and overtly criticize Jim and Michael over the new payment scheme. Of course they could feel jealous about other workers who are getting higher raise, but shouldn't they keep their mouth shut? 

Each employee is there to do his or her own, often highly characteristic task, and ultimately contribute to generating profit for the company. That's why they are being compensated. Corporate is not an egalitarian organization, and people with different jobs can and often should be differently paid. 

Jim, as one of the regional co-manager, is responsible for maximizing profit of the branch and the whole corporation. Co-managers, and only the co-managers have the full authority to make strategic adjustment of payment schemes, unless it is unlawful or contraditory to collective agreement with labor union. 

Jim does not need approval of anyone else in his branch (except Michael) to decide who gets raise and how much. Also, the lower employees do not have any sayings in making that decision, simply because it is not their responsibility. 

The lower employees should at least come up with some good reason to get equal rate of payment increase. But they did not. All they said was that other employees in the same branch are getting relatively higher amout of raise, and it is not fair. So what? That does not necessarily mean anything about their own job performance or relative contribution to the company. 

In American companies, is it really OK to just stand up and complain openly and loudly whenever your boss makes some decision that you don't like?",11,1585667356,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fsek1s/are_american_companies_really_unruly_like_dunder/,DunderMifflin,2

fs9h6l,lxndrdvn,If The Office character were European countries,"I wrote this piece several months ago but never shared it here. I just remembered it again, so here's something to kill five minutes of time with. Let me know if you agree or disagree. Don‚Äôt be offended if your country pairing is not flattering. Many of the characters aren't exactly role models. The relationship dynamics between countries don't necessarily match. Enjoy!

**Michael ‚Äì United Kingdom**

Loud, self-absorbed, needy, insecure. Seemingly runs the show but in fact just distracts and disturbs everyone else‚Äôs productivity.

**Jim ‚Äì The Netherlands**

Enjoys the good times and works to live ‚Äì not the other way around. Goofs around and likes to make other people laugh. Puts in the minimum amount of work to skeet by.

**Dwight ‚Äì Finland**

No nonsense. Serious. Bordering autism. Works hard, follows rules, and has strange hobbies.

**Pam ‚Äì Sweden**

Innocent, dreamy, artsy, peaceful. Doesn‚Äôt ruffle feathers. Tolerant of others, avoids offending people.

**Oscar ‚Äì Germany**

Competent. Doesn‚Äôt draw attention to himself. Separates private life from work. Has no tolerance for hindering productivity.

**Angela ‚Äì France**

The embodiment of bureaucracy. Likes cats. Scoffs a lot. Will have two men duel over her love.

**Kevin ‚Äì Poland**

Tries hard but is not quite there. One of the overlooked characters but has tremendous impact in building the community. Big heart.

**Creed ‚Äì Russia**

Mysterious, has criminal tendencies, bordering insanity. Nobody knows what he‚Äôs up to, they only catch glimpses of his turbulent life. Not afraid to intimidate people into submission.

**Meredith ‚Äì Denmark**

Likes to party. Will protest anything getting in the way of having a good time.

**Kelly ‚Äì Spain**

Confrontational, emotional, and expressive. Loves to gossip and play social games. Likely to shout ‚ÄùHow dare you?‚Äù, in the middle of a meeting.

**Ryan ‚Äì Italy**

Charming, confident, ambitious. Changes his mind often and erratically. Cuts corners, flies high, and crashes hard.

**Toby ‚Äì Latvia**

Meek, depressive, quiet. Doesn‚Äôt exhume a strong presence.

**Stanley ‚Äì Switzerland**

Shows up and does the work. Inattentive to what‚Äôs happening around him. Will have multiple secret affairs.

**Phyllis ‚Äì Hungary**

Melancholic but has a passionate private life. Distrustful of newcomers, likely to say ‚Äùyou have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie‚Äù.

**Andy ‚Äì Austria**

Productive and outwardly positive, will attempt to use charm to get ahead. Comes up with teasing nicknames but can‚Äôt accept criticism himself. May go into a fit of rage and somehow get away with it.

**Erin ‚Äì Estonia**

Bubbly exterior covers a dark history. Unintentionally quirky and wants to be included.",4,1585644625,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fs9h6l/if_the_office_character_were_european_countries/,DunderMifflin,1

fs5rzx,gatorzero,"""Goodbye, Toby"" is a very disheartening episode.","Just re-watched it for the umpteenth time and I received this episode's ending in a more somber tone than ever before. From Michael meeting Jan at the store, it all goes downhill.

* Michael, at first disillusioned with Jan after learning about the pregnancy, then making the decision to relapse with her when he calls her at the end. You wish you could slap him and make him see how wrong he is for going back to Jan, but he's just unable to see it. Even after Holly practically throws herself at him and essentially asks him out, which makes this even more sad. It's like Michael was choosing to purposefully make himself unhappy, almost like an addict.
* Dwight blames himself for his (near) loss of Angela and seems to get pretty hard on himself while hanging his head in despair.
* Both Jim &amp; Pam unfulfilled and dejected when left with blue balls of an proposal. Pam even starts to cry.

I am very appreciative of these decisions from the writers to make the season end with 10 minutes that are very heavy, at least relatively speaking. Little relief comes in between these moments, too. These writing choices of course bring greater payoffs in future episodes.

Has anyone else thought of the episode this way or had any thoughts?",2,1585626333,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fs5rzx/goodbye_toby_is_a_very_disheartening_episode/,DunderMifflin,1

fs5en7,Plus-Minute,Holly and Michael,"The one episode that never makes sense to me is the episode where Holly must move ""back"" to Nashua. Holly is in Scranton only as a temp until Toby gets back from jury duty. She came from Nashua and will be going back at some point. That is all fine...however, 

1 - Holly doesn't seem to know how long the trip takes to get back to Nashua. Seems odd considering she just came from there. Even if she flew, she had to have an idea of how long it takes to drive. 

2 - During the trip back, she is look at a pamphlet and talking about going to the outlet malls next weekend like it is something special. The lady lives there and acts like she's never hear of these outlet malls. 

3 - How does the 4.5 hour trip - roughly how far they are into their trip when this happens - cause them to break up? Surely, they could have gone through this for one week before deciding it was a bad idea to date that far apart. 

4 - When they are looking for the bed and breakfast, they are looking in the middle of a forest. What exit did they take that made them (Michael) believe there was any restaurant on this exit, let alone a hidden bed and breakfast? Where they looking for The Quiet Corn?

5 - Why does Holly have to leave anyways? It doesn't track. Understandably, the company may Michael and Holly dating, but...It is fine when Jan and Michael date. Granted, they don't work in the same office. However, it is clear that HR works for corporate and doesn't directly report to the regional manager. Doesn't it stand to reason that it would be a larger problem that Michael and Jan were dating as opposed to Michael and Holly?

The two most intense scenes to me were the ""I can't believe you came"" ""That's what she said"", and the conference with Erin's parents. Kinda cheesy but really strong.

Probably not the first or the last to say that, but I had to say it out!

frxv4p,andreagar,I think Pam deserved a better character arc - here's an idea,"Out of the 'main' characters (Jim, Dwight, Pam, Michael), I feel like Pam is the one who had the least ideal character arc. She was always seen as a timid and inert person, just going with the flow and never trying anything, even almost marrying Roy despite being engaged for years with no prospect. 

We see her character 'grow' through three main phases, and each of this has a catalyst and a reward. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1) Roy Phase** \- Pam is in a menial job, working for a company that she doesn't really care about (except for maybe Jim), she's comfortable but not really happy with her engagement with Roy because it seems like it's going nowhere.   


**Catalyst:** Jim's Confession ‚Äì Because of this Pam was able to see that she could deserve better and she takes a brave step by not going through the wedding. 

  
**Reward:** She's free from Roy, and has a more daring outlook in life. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Single Phase** \- Pam's still 'stuck' in the same job. But she gets her own apartment, starts taking arts classes and is generally more independent compared to before. Her next challenge at this phase is to confront her feelings for Jim.   


**Catalyst:** Pam's Confession - During the 'Beach Games' episode, Pam was the only one brave enough to do the fire walk (except for dwight) and eventually confesses to Jim.  


**Reward:** Pam eventually becomes 'freed' of the burden of her feelings towards Jim. Despite Karen being there, despite risking her friendship with Jim, she was brave enough to admit that she had feelings for Jim too and she misses their old friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Jim Phase** \- Jim and Pam eventually end up together and this is because of both character's choices to be brave and confront their comfort zones. But this for me is where Pam's character gets lost. She get's a few more chances to get into new 'phases' in her life but none of them seem to lead to actual character progression.   


* She tries and fails Art School because she wants to be an 'artist' but took up graphic design plus she misses Jim and they get married instead.
* She bravely joins the Michael Scott Paper Company as a partner, shows initiative but eventually leads to nothing when they get bought back by Dunder Mifflin because she sucked at sales. 
* Other than getting married to Jim, having a few kids, and 'hustling' her way as an Office Administrator, Pam really doesn't get any other chances to grow as an individual. 

  
Now here's my idea: I think **Pam should've** **been the Scranton Branch's HR replacement** for Toby. Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

* She has a pleasant disposition and often displays a good sense of emotional intelligence perfect for managing conflicts within the office. She's also been in the branch for a very long time meaning she would've been a good in-house choice.
* Aside from Jim, Pam is the other character that's mainly used as an audience surrogate or 'straight man' to show how quirky or crazy the other characters are. In fact, when Jim leaves for Athlead this is mainly her role in the later seasons. 
* She can act as a good foil against Michael's antics. There could even be a whole episode dedicated to Michael coming to terms that Pam, a person he adores, is now the HR rep, a positioned that he loathed.
* Holly could still have been on the show and still have the same arc she had with Michael. She could've been an HR rep from corporate and stayed in Scranton for a few weeks to train Pam in Human Resources. She could've had the same recurring role, going to the branch to check up on Pam's progress, maybe she stays a little longer in the branch when Pam goes on maternity leave and this is where she and Michael could do the whole 'AJ' thing. 
* This would also mean that Pam has a character arc outside of her relationship with Jim. She failed as an artist / saleswoman but she found her 'calling' in a professional career that would still take advantage of her strengths as someone who is caring and understanding, and let her stay in the company that she's grown to care about.",3,1585597917,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/frxv4p/i_think_pam_deserved_a_better_character_arc_heres/,DunderMifflin,1

frxey9,maluminse,Roy + Pam,"Roy and Pam were a better match. Roy was a regular guy content with his life, slow moving. He was a former football star of his high school. Pam was the volleyball star of that high.

Jim wanted to expand, wasn't content to stay in Scranton. 

Roy was a good guy. Communicated with Jim about the rumour of him liking Pam. Said I know you're a decent guy so I'm not worried. Yet Jim still went behind Roy's back. Even right after Roy asked Jim to take care of Pam on casino night.

Pam wanted more but when it came down to it she was a small town girl. Her eyes were bigger than her heart. 

She left her high school sweetheart to hold back someone to be what she wanted. Basically Pam was Roy as they portray Roy. In that Roy held Pam back from her dreams. Pam did that to Jim. 

So Roy and Pam were actually more alike.

In the end Roy was a big person. Better than Pam imagined. Her envy/jealousy apparent that he could play the piano and run a local successful business.

Pam and Jim have a high probability of divorce. Marriage counseling in first 3 years?  Pam screwed up.",36,1585596517,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/frxey9/roy_pam/,DunderMifflin,1

I feel like putting Andy in the role as a manager was a decent idea at first. It wouldn‚Äôt disrupt the flow of the show, as Jim, Dwight, and others could keep their current roles. Also this could have allowed Andy to step up and grow as a character. But, the decision didn‚Äôt quite make sense, as Andy was the worst salesman of the branch. Andy felt like Michael Jr. in most of seasons 8 and 9. Using many recycled Michael storylines, the show just depreciated in quality. His character totally transformed from likeable side character to a pathetic doucebag. He didn‚Äôt really have a positive relationship. The office supported him in the List, the Incentive, and Garden Party, then kind of left him. Jim stood up for him a few times, while him and Pam had some interaction during the Florida arc. Other than that, he was a terrible friend/boyfriend to Erin, pretty much lost his relationship with Dwight/Darryl, and just tried to cater to everything for Robert California. 

So would the show have done?

until this past 2 weeks with the quarantine, same thing happend but this time i googled ""I can't watch the office it is too cringy"" and two threads came up [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/3ne7k1/i_just_started_watching_the_office_i_dont_know_if/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/7hf02m/when_does_the_office_stop_being_so_uncomfortably/), after reading the comments i started watching and tried my best and i finished the first season, and stared the second season...

**And my god, it is a whole different show, my goodness i laughed so much and enjoyed it. it is really really a masterpiece of comedy.**

I literally could not stop watching, i am in the 7th season now.

so for all of you who like me could not handle Michael, **this is only the first season** and it is not that long of a season, just keep watching, you will have the best trip with comedy in your life.

**Dwight**: That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?

**Michael**: Todd Packer.

**Dwight**: No!

**Michael**: Yeah.

**Dwight**: I thought he was out on the road.
**
Michael**: He was, but, uh‚Ä¶ that desk was empty. He‚Äôd come in and sit there sometimes.

fr92fo,DoNotSmokePot,Why do people justify bullying Toby,"I never thought it was funny. Witnessing the way Toby is belittled and  condescended to by not only Michael but the rest of the office clerks makes each rewatch that much more painful for me. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôve sort of started disliking the show because of this one specific delusion every character has in common save for perhaps Pam and Oscar. I can clearly remember being left dissatisfied with how Toby‚Äôs storyline ends when I first watched the show. Everyone got their happy ending except him, and I always found him to be the most deserving of one. Nobody ever threw him a bone, including the writers.

What is possibly the most annoying part of this whole situation is the fan base‚Äôs response (as usual). I know that some of you share my opinion, but it seems as if the overwhelming majority of office fans are perfectly content with the hate Toby receives, and go as far as to try justifying it.

I try to argue that Toby deserves better, yet I am frequently met with a wall of the following: 

* some overdone ‚ÄòMichael hating on Toby‚Äô quote (bin Ladin/hitler joke, evil snail joke, not part of his own family joke, Lemonhead, etc.) this especially annoys me because they don‚Äôt understand the actual jokes behind most of these - Michael is overly critical of Toby on multiple occasions, despite his criticisms and insults applying more to himself than Toby, exemplifying his hypocrisy. However people take them at face value, completely ignoring the nuance of the joke and using it as a judgment of Toby‚Äôs character

* ‚ÄúToby is creepy in the later seasons‚Äù - this one also pisses me off, mostly because it is often a double standard between multiple office characters. I don‚Äôt know how some people can criticize the writers for Andy‚Äôs regressions in the final season yet in the same breath try to justify their blind hate towards Toby by using his flanderized creepiness in the later seasons as validation for their opinions without extending the same criticism towards the writers for his own regression. And honestly, I can understand Toby‚Äôs personality change a lot more than anyone else‚Äôs. The mental ramifications of seven or more years of emotional and verbal abuse by your employers, coworkers and ex-spouse is sure to have some adverse cognitive effects on anyone and everyone.

* ‚ÄúToby is the Scranton strangler‚Äù. I honestly can‚Äôt believe this theory is widely held in the community. I‚Äôm convinced that it started off as a joke, and then spiralled into a widely accepted idea as more and more people took the theory literally. The best proof anyone has that he is the strangler is his ‚Äúcar‚Äù (which is likely just one of the producers‚Äô or cast members‚Äô vehicles they used as placeholders) is seen driving down the street the office is located on, as it is getting chased by the police. There is no logic in this claim. They caught the man fleeing and it was not Toby. If Toby had any relation to this case, he would have been inducted as a suspect since his name is tied onto the registration and insurance of that car. People don‚Äôt want to accept the idea that it was a production oversight, since they probably just used any random car to film the chase, and in this case it happened to be the one Toby apparently ‚Äúowned‚Äù. The rest of the theory is speculation, most of which is rooted in flawed logic or contextless quotes from the show. The proof behind the ‚Äútheory‚Äù is highly selective and cherrypicked, and you could vilify any character for the strangulations if you misconstrued them in the same way. However, since it fuels the rampant Toby hate in the community, people are perfectly fine with overlooking glaring issues in their beliefs as long as it justifies their broken point of view. I could talk about this theory‚Äôs holes for days, and in fact I wanted to put a video at some point in the future, but I don‚Äôt see the need to since I found out that Paul Liberstein himself admitted in an interview that they had never once considered this potential plot line during the writing of the show.

* Toby‚Äôs ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù crush on Pam. This just exemplifies the immaturity amongst many office fans. I agree him resting his hand on her knee can be considered sexual assault but it clearly wasn‚Äôt out of malice, and this is the only talking point some people have to insinuate he was a predator. The reality is that he was likely deeply in love with Pam, and being someone who‚Äôs crushed quite hardly over another in a similar way, I can relate to the pain he must feel daily. Some people can‚Äôt say the same and I can understand, but I don‚Äôt see it as a reason to completely ignore his feelings which are only human to have.

Overall I think Toby just deserved better. But most importantly I think he deserved someone to care about him. I frequently think that if someone were to ask him how he was on any given day, he‚Äôd likely break down into tears because that would have been the first time anyone gave him any sort of consideration after years of working in what is definitely a hostile work environment.

The other characters of this show have a lot of traits one can be more critical about. Jim and Pam have an overwhelming sense of superiority over others, Dwight is borderline inhumane at times, Stanley is a serial cheater, Phyllis and Bob are perpetrators of senseless violence, Ryan is a sociopath, Creed is alluded to being an actual murderer (if anyone had potential to be a strangler it was him), Erin is close-minded and judgmental, Meredith is a bad parent and alcoholic, Oscar is an elitist, Kevin is a fraud, Andy is superficial and socially inept, Angela is the complete opposite of an angel and lacks basic self-awareness, the list goes on. Yet people fixate on the quiet guy in HR who never really bothered anyone. They extrapolate these far fetched theories in an effort to justify some blind hate that originated out of one too many jokes that people started to take seriously, completely ignoring what actually made them jokes.

I hope that most people who find Toby creepy or repulsive understand the irony behind the dislike. Because in reality Toby shows all the telltale signs of crippling depression and social anxiety brought on by emotional abuse, and the ignorance around it on behalf of some of the fans is astounding. If they were to encounter this kind of behaviour in real life, how would they respond? Would they extend to that person some humanity? Or would they continue to demean them and jeopardize their mental health, justifying their bullying because that person isn‚Äôt able to stand up for themselves? I honestly don‚Äôt know at this point.",14,1585501150,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fr92fo/why_do_people_justify_bullying_toby/,DunderMifflin,2

fqz2de,fatcalabasses,"‚ÄúGoodbye, Michael‚Äù is an amazing episode","Honestly the entire episode is amazing, from the hilarious intro with Michael and Dwight arguing about running from bears to the emotional scene with Jim and Michael near the end. It‚Äôs such an interesting episode because it really starts the odd decline in the shows rewatch-ability, like of course Steve Carell is essential to the show, but so many of the characters just feel like they begin to slowly hollow out after this episode. I still enjoy seasons 8&amp;9 but good lord if you can point to a single point where this show begins to lose its belly laughing nature, it‚Äôs the episode after this one (inner circle I think).",1,1585452885,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fqz2de/goodbye_michael_is_an_amazing_episode/,DunderMifflin,1

fqwyyl,LongWillyMan420,Just finished watching this show for the first time and damn...,"This is the first time ever I finished watching a TV show and immediately just wanted to begin watching it again. I started watching this show after some YouTube clips of Jim pranking Dwight, the fire drill and some other stuff but at first didn‚Äôt begin watching the series because it wasn‚Äôt on German Netflix (The Office is not very popular in Europe for whatever reason). Then after searching through a lot of online streaming sites, many showing more porn ads than the office episode I finally found a site where I could watch this godly show. This show is also the first time ever, that almost made me cried on multiple occasions (Jim proposing, Jim and Michael saying goodbye, Pam watching the CD, etc.) while watching a TV show. It had like 500 things that I remember watching over the last few months like if I just saw them. Especially in the last few episodes I realized what a huge amount of time I had binged through and I just can imagine how people watching this show from season 1 on must have felt, seeing these memorable moments of the last 8 years passing by again. Sadly, as I said, in Europe this show isn‚Äôt popular at all (literally there is not a single person I know that watched this show or even knows about it (leaving away the popular memes like ‚Äûgod no‚Äú and ‚Äûthey are the same picture‚Äú)) but I won‚Äôt rest until everyone of them has seen this show.

However, I've watched seasons 8 and 9 only once because both seasons are awful. The story line, jokes, the characters (can't stand Nellie) are just not there anymore. Few episodes are good of course and certain scenes are really funny and emotional. But overall, the level of the show just dropped and it became a different type of cringe.

I tried to watch them again but I don't have the same addiction and appreciation as for the other seasons.

fqnrvs,girlgirly,I just finished watching The Office,In like one week I watched the last three seasons. I cried a lot with the chapters Good bye Michael and also I've just read that apparently it wasn't Steve Carell's decision to leave but the producers decision so that made me mad. Specially because season 8 without Michael is a mess. Like season 8 is the worst one from the series. Also I'm a little disappointed with what they did to Andy's character. But other than that I loved the end. And also I did cry with the two last chapters but honestly this days I'm feeling too emotional so yes that's probably why. Oh and I love the Dwight/Jim friendship. Also before watching the last episode I went back to watch the first one and that made it like more emotional for me. But I'm also disappointed because I've already saw the scene with Michael and Dwight in his wedding way before and like that wasn't such a surprise. And I'm the only one feeling bad for Toby?? And by the way I did like the chapters where Creed is the manager,5,1585414335,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fqnrvs/i_just_finished_watching_the_office/,DunderMifflin,2

fqhn4u,DjArie,An amazing scene of Michael,"Just want to put it out there that I'm watching The Office for the first time and how extremely overwhelmed I am by the overall show, performance and making but especially by character writing. How much depth characters of a show has  which appears a silly sitcom from a distance if you're not looking close enough, is just mind boggling.

Dwight is the most adequate example of it. How his character is responsible for almost half of the material of the show because of its writing which keeps exploring him and his life throughout the show yet keeping the audience hooked and asking for more.

Survivor Man, S4 E11

Michael just got back to office from his adventure while his team is celebrating Creed's birthday and talking to Jim who had a rough day trying to put all birthday at once which he thought would be more productive and efficient but apparently couldn't keep co-workers happy leading to internal mild clash over cakes but now is relieved by the responsibility of manager realizing how tough it can get.

Michael's response, ""rookie mistake"" implying he did the same in the beginning which follows with ""just wait 10 years you'll figure it out"" to which Jim replies he doesn't think he'll be there in 10 year to which Michael respond,

""That's what I said.""

Anybody working in corporate can relate to it and understands how real, funny, unsettling and depressing this scene is. Not only that but just few exchange of lines emphasis the fact how much Michael knows about managing people in corporate and he's not some stupid guy who happens to be the manager.

Then realizing how Jim got depressed he adds pun ""That's what she said"" to relieve the tension which he also state himself yet Jim can't tell because it worked so well.

The same can be seen in Traveling Salesman where his character is shown displaying extremely well people skill and stopping Andy from behaving usually how he does infront of a client, being calm to Andy's mistake and unresponsive to constant bitching about Dwight, adding another layer and silently implying he is not really a stupid alien as he seems and can sniff bullshit if he wants to.

He knows and cares about his people. He knows what it takes to do the job. He's smart yet the audience never gets to see all of it at once which is just writing at it's best. This show has an extremely fine ingredients of a great show along with some of the finest techniques of making ever, can't say anything about the conclusion yet. I'm hooked, let's see how further deep it can go.

The episode, too my knowledge, is an episode in which they hold a funeral for Michael Scott and then he ends up showing up there and he then screams something along the lines of ""I'm Alive!"" As if hes surprised by this. I just remember it being the reason I originally started watching the office, but I can't remember 100% if it was actually the office or if I'm mixing memories.

And then Mifflin... of course he killed himself later."" This proves that the entire series titled The Office: An American Workplace was made only to highlight what Dunder-Mifflin did. Mifflin was probably a celebrity figure, as most millionaires are, and, because people were so sad, they made a documentary about it.

fpz2hq,officegroupie,Michael Scott has a sad life,"Out of the numerous times I‚Äôve watched the Office, realIzing Michael Scott has a terribly sad life never crossed my mind until recently. I‚Äôve started the show over again and slowly I noticed all of the little things. His whole life he‚Äôs desperate for affection and a family. Michael convinces himself to date Jan, the most toxic person he knows because he is so needy for someone to ‚Äúlove him‚Äù. In my opinion, Jan never loved him. Sure, she liked him but not loved and it was evident through the way she treated him. She recorded them having sex even though it made him uncomfortable, forced him to sleep on a tiny cushioned bench, made him participate in her fantasies despite the fact he didn‚Äôt enjoy it ( Michael mentioned how she made him wear the school girl outfit), she was the reason he went bankrupt and he had to slave to two jobs while she did nothing, she shattered his tv and broke his dundie and overall she treated Michael very poorly. Everyone claims that the dinner party episode is one of the most comedic, but I think it‚Äôs sad. I feel it reveals the truth of Jan and Michaels relationship and the manipulation involved. For goodness sake the woman made him get a vasectomy and undo it multiple times meanwhile she went to a sperm donor to have a baby! Ryan Howard is another character who took advantage of Michael. Throughout the show it‚Äôs obvious that their friendship is one sided and Ryan uses this to his benefit. Whether it was to weave his way back into Dunder Mifflin for a job or convincing Michael to invest in Wuff, he always used their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù as a method to get what he wanted and Michael doesn‚Äôt know any better. Truly all Michael wanted was a family (thankfully he has one by the end of the show) and since his own family was never there for him he creates a little fantasy in his head that his employees are his family. Karen, Ed, Jan and many others have told him that his workers are not his family and that they are just simply his employees. Overall I just feel much sympathy for this man. He lives a lonely life and uses comedy to cope with it. Maybe I‚Äôm looking way too into it. Leave you‚Äôre thoughts, I‚Äôm curious of what others think.",12,1585323564,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fpz2hq/michael_scott_has_a_sad_life/,DunderMifflin,3

1) Dwight helps Erin make Andy jealous at Robert's party.

fptnkc,mynameisntlogan,"Remove this if it doesn‚Äôt belong here, but can we discuss what they did to Andy in season 9? I just want to discuss it with fellow Office lovers.","I‚Äôm not trying to sound cliche. I‚Äôm sure this has been brought up a lot. But I just need some closure while discussing it with fellow fans of The Office. I am an absolute diehard. I watched all of the show while it was airing (granted, I was a lot younger then, so I blindly enjoyed everything that happened). Since then, I‚Äôve seen every episode probably 5 times on average. Some much more often, some less often. 

And the final preface is that I love most of the less popular parts of The Office. I really enjoy seasons 6, 8 and 9 overall, even though many don‚Äôt. I love the character development and I love the story arcs. So I‚Äôm not just someone that dislikes what is popular to dislike. That being said: 

**What they did to Andy in season 9 is absolutely inexcusable.** It was an absolute, unfettered character assassination. I‚Äôm not sure if Ed Helms pissed of the writers, or something? But if he did, I‚Äôd be less upset if they would‚Äôve just killed off his character by making him fall down an elevator shaft. 

Andy is turned into an absolute asshole in season 9. He‚Äôs lacks any semblance of self awareness (I understand pre-season 9 Andy wasn‚Äôt the most self-aware person, but come on), he lacks any tact, he starts treating his coworkers like shit, and he is completely delusional in quitting his job and searching for a career in the talent industry. 

But worse than *anything,* is the absolute neglect he shows for Erin. He‚Äôs a complete jerk to her. If their relationship was brand new at the time, then sure, I could understand it. If we hadn‚Äôt witnessed *dozens of beautiful moments between Erin and him* before season 9, then i wouldn‚Äôt care if the show broke them up. 

But now, it is absolutely sickening going back and rewatching him and Erin‚Äôs relationship in seasons 6 through 8, and seeing all of the moments they have together. Rewatching Andy running into the bachelorette party and telling his ex-girlfriend and all of her friends that he is in love with Erin, and that she‚Äôs the best girl in the entire world and how happy she makes him, absolutely devastates me just thinking about what will happen to them just a few episodes later. 

Obviously the writers intend for Erin and Andy to end up together from the start. And that much is clear all the way until the end of season 8. So what I‚Äôm the absolute he‚Äôll changed between the end of season 8, and the beginning of season 9? It wouldn‚Äôt even be as bad if the writers broke up Erin and Andy by making them simply break up due to incompatibility (like they did with Darryl and Val), instead of turning Andy into an insufferable monster. 

The worst part is, I like Pete‚Äôs character. And I like Erin‚Äôs and his romance. But the writers/producers try so hard to make us care as much about Erin and Pete‚Äôs relationship over like 8 episodes of development, as we cared about her and Andy‚Äôs relationship after 3 seasons of development. And it doesn‚Äôt work. 

I also don‚Äôt understand how the writers expect people to be okay with it, and to just forget about everything we‚Äôve seen Erin and Andy go through in the previous 3 seasons. 

Season 9 Andy is as bad as Roy. That‚Äôs right. You heard me. And the writers want us root for Pete AKA ‚Äúnew Jim‚Äù to get the adorable, goofy, kind-hearted (and red-headed) receptionist who is complacent about the neglectful, toxic, one-sided relationship that she is stuck in. Sound familiar? 

Why *on earth* would the writers/producers try to pull off that huge of a turnaround in half of a season, with no indicators of this developing beforehand? After they spend 3 seasons making us root for Andy and Erin, and even she‚Äôs tears at some of their beautiful moments? 

My final statement is a reiteration of my first: That is completely ridiculous and inexcusable. 

P.S. And before someone says it, no, the finale does not redeem Andy and make everything better. It‚Äôs too little, too late. He‚Äôs happy and he‚Äôs come to terms with who he is, and that‚Äôs great. But he‚Äôs already lost everything and nobody cares about his success anymore.",11,1585299353,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fptnkc/remove_this_if_it_doesnt_belong_here_but_can_we/,DunderMifflin,1

fpnx2a,droogMaster64,First impressions: The Office Seasons 1 &amp; 2,"I just finished the last episode of season 2. They ended off season 2 really well. 

I'll just give my opinions on the various characters given what I've seen so far,

&amp;#x200B;

Dwight: I really like his character, he's so rigid that whenever he does something even remotely human it's really satisfying to watch. My favorite moment would be when he had a concussion. 

Jim: Probably the most normal guy in the show, it's great that they have him in there the sort of equalize all  the craziness. Plus his relationship with Pam is probably one of the most interesting parts of the show at this point.

Pam: Pam is best in the scenes where Jim is there. She's one of the only other normal people other than Jim.

Stanley: Very relatable character. Everyone knows a Stanley. Angry Stanley is someone I wouldn't mess with.

Kevin: Seems like a guy you can depend on.

Angela: Her relationship with Dwight still mystifies me.

Phyllis: I guess she's pretty normal too.

Meredith: I have no idea what's going on with this one. She feels really normal but there are just a few scenes which make me wonder a lot.

Creed: Who even is this guy. I feels like he's just some homeless guy who just comes into the office uninvited.

Oscar: I think he may be secretly gay. Just a theory.

Ryan: I guess this guy is pretty normal as well.

Kelly: Talks way too much. But that's what makes her a good character.

Toby: This guy is on xanax for sure.

Michael Scott: I hate him, I really do. I have never wanted to punch a character more than I have with this guy. Either Steve Carell is a genius or the writer are or both, but this character is just so frustratingly perfect.",6,1585271989,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fpnx2a/first_impressions_the_office_seasons_1_2/,DunderMifflin,1

fpdh0y,pseudojack99,A Letter from Jim Halpert to Pam Beesly in the Apocalypse,"Dearest Pam,

&amp;#x200B;

Just as Chance the Rapper loves his wife,

I love you, my wife, Pam.

I love you so much I'd stare directly into the camera and say, ""I love my wife, Pam. Do you know her? 

She's my wife.""

It has been a fortnight or, more accurately, 3 years since you left my life.

I do not remember what my son looks like, but I hope he looks like you, my wife, Pam.

I dream of him, and Cece, and you, my wife, Pam, from my humble quarantine.

You have no idea the horrors we have quaran-seen.

Sorry, little joke to lighten the mood.

Dwight and I have have begun to burn paper for warmth and as a secondary measure to ward off any infected.

Yesterday I put our burning paper in Jell-O as a prank. Dwight was furious. It no longer burns.

You would have loved it, my wife, Pam.

I miss the way we used to make fun of our boss, Michael, to his face because he was a ludicrous man, 

and, even more, an idiot.

Sometimes I walk over to the desk that used to be yours and talk to you.

I hear your laugh.

Your snort.

Your cough.

And imagine you were still here with me.

Michael once said that if he were in a room with Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, and Toby, and he had two 

bullets, he'd shoot Toby twice.

It seems like such an easy question in hindsight.

I hope to join you soon.

fpckya,We-re_Gonna_Do_Great,Still don't quite understand Dwight's Employee of the Month Scheme in Scott's Tots episode...,"I'm on the infamous Scott's Tots episode where Dwight unleashes his Employee of the month scheme to get Jim fired, and I am still unsure how Dwight got Jim to pick himself. I understand up to the part where Dwight establishes his own score sheet that is supposed to be skewed in Jim's favor. However, when presenting it to Jim, Jim notably takes the clipboard and ""gathers the data from Toby"" himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

This would mean either:  
1. Toby was in on it because he would, at the very least, have to know who each random employee number was assigned to in order to match the data to it.

* This is questionable because Toby isn't even in this episode, and it's not established that he'd go along with this. I know he has a certain disdain towards Jim, but this doesn't warrant this kind of response without an explanation.

2. Dwight organized the chart to value traits more that Jim would possess more of compared to everyone else.

* Again, this is doubtful that Jim could have some ""traits"" being valued that were so blatantly better than his coworkers for Dwight to take advantage of; he would still have to use unbiased data gathered from Toby.

Am I missing something in the episode that explains how Dwight pulled this one off?",2,1585233520,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fpckya/still_dont_quite_understand_dwights_employee_of/,DunderMifflin,1

fp9tf6,KevinsChilli_,Creeds heist,"Okay so hear me out, creed has always been a weird and suspicious guy. And we only find out until the last season that he was a drug dealer etc. Then after rewatches we start to see all his crazy behaviour and create theories about him. I've watched the office about maybe 10 times (I lost count) and I've made this theory about creed. Feel free  to look into it and add some parts and evidence etc. I also apologise if this is badly written I am on mobile

Okay to start off, I believe that creed was planning some sort of heist. If we think back to when micheal was getting a new chair, pam gets a call from creed as she promised creed her chair when she got Michaels old chair. He says that when he gets that chair, then he'll have two chairs and he had just one more to go. It sounds stupid but why would someone want three chairs?
On another occasion when micheal reveals Stanley is cheating on his wife, micheal spreads false gossip about everyone including that creed has asthma. He says the following ""if they find out I have asthma then they wont let me scuba, if I cant scuba then what has this all been about"" 
And onto my last point, the episode where jim finds out he has a commission cap he goes around the office for things to do while hes bored. Creed asks him if hes looking for work, asking him to how far he can reach and how long he can hold his breath. That last part is very important.
So maybe he was planning some sort of underwater heist and needed people. It's very limited evidence but I thought I'd share it just in case anyone else wanted to add some evidence to it. I also apologise for not putting episode numbers etc as it was all off memory.",11,1585221530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fp9tf6/creeds_heist/,DunderMifflin,1

fp6xuq,SkylarWeston,Fun Fact: You can‚Äôt buy wine at a Costco in PA,"I was watching The Office Extended today, and on S4E5 (Launch Party P1), Jan references on the phone that she bought wine at Costco. However, in PA, the state has a monopoly on wine and spirit sales, which means stores such as Costco, Walmart, or even most gad stations don‚Äôt sell alcohol. Nowadays, these laws have been relaxed or circumvented by other means, but the law was really strict in 2007. This either means that Jan went to New Jersey or New York, or the writers made a small mistake. Funnily enough, IASIP made the same mistake in their Hostage episode, with them buying alcohol at a gas station.

fp3x0n,beets2health,S3 E11 Back from vacation - potential to be in the top 5 best episodes,"Just a couple things to jot your memory.. (skip this if you‚Äôre familiar with the episode)


This is the episode that Michael returns from the Jamaica trip with Jan.
 A sensitive photo was circulated around the company via/FWD:packaging (not packer) and Michael tries endlessly to fend off anyone in the warehouse or the office from forwarding it to anyone else. Even Toby tells him his ex wife forwarded the photo so that drives him even crazier. 
Pam helps Jim with his issue with Karen moving in down the street from him. Afterwards she feels conflicted and upset given her deeper feelings for Jim.
My favorite part- Dwight approaches, noticing Pam upset and says, ‚Äúwho did this to you? Where is he?‚Äù Looking around seemingly looking for tools in his belt. Pam responds, ‚Äúwhat? No.. it‚Äôs nothing‚Äù seemingly comforted by his concern. Such a sweet moment.
Later, once Michael rid the blown up photo of topless Jan, and continuing with a Jamaican inspired luncheon in the warehouse, Jan enters and dozens of staff surrounding them are silent watching an awkward introduction between the two.. ‚Äúhello Michael, can we talk in your office?‚Äù
Following Michael‚Äôs walk of shame up the stairs from the warehouse to the office.

fp361y,PikachaAa,Unpopular Opinion(?): S9 is great.,"I have heard all the criticism against the last season, but I actually like the story archs.  Lmk if I‚Äôm being stupid here: The characters transcend their caricatures and show real growth over the arc of the season.  


Clark grows up. 


Robert California is funny AF. 


Erin finds out what she wants with Pete and starts to self actualize.  She trusts herself to break up with Andy and finds her mom. 


Andy is an asshole &amp; doesn‚Äôt appear for most the season. But he finds purpose in remedying his family issues. He reaches rock bottom and has self discovery in solace.


Dwight connects with Pam through protecting her art, and self-actualizes as a manager of the branch. He overcomes Andy‚Äôs overbearing nature and proves himself as worthy. He finds his true love in Angela and realizes he has a child and future with her. 


Jim &amp; Pam overcome their conflict of interests thru the Brian arch and move to Philly with brighter futures. Pam learns to function independently from Jim via her mural and solitude, and Jim learns the true value of their relationship. 


Darryl compromises with Jim, gets his new job, and aligns with Oscar when he pretends to be gay.  Ends his relationship with Val because of this.


Oscar and Angela‚Äôs alliance against the Senator is a charming story of friendship and solidarity. 


Kevin is found out to be a fraud but ultimately starts a career in a more self-actualized field of Bar ownership.


Nellie is funny. Meredith wears a different wig each episode. Kelly &amp; Ryan relapse but it‚Äôs fitting to their personalities. 


The branch has a great quarter. Michael makes an appearance which doesn‚Äôt affect the arch but puts a good bookend on the series. 


Idk.  I just really like this season.",7,1585188220,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fp361y/unpopular_opinion_s9_is_great/,DunderMifflin,1

foxzb7,HappyGabe,Wow Season 8 sucks ass.,"Haven't even gotten to nine, but I've arrived at S08E08 and holy shit this is bad. 

Any joke relating to Robert California is done through a ""He's 'smart' and interesting and everyone wants to kiss his ass he's so charismatic"" filter.

Andy gets bullied by his staff for no good reason.

Dwight sexually assaults Jim. It's played very straight by Jim, making the scene uncomfortable and not funny. The joke is, ""Dwight is grabbing Jim's dick ain't that silly"". And then Pam continues her insecurity.
**it's a show**, I get it, but you can't have us believe these characters and care about the seriousness of their lives.

Same episode ends with Jim and Pam realizing he has high blood pressure, and I'm removed from the severity of the situation due to the reason for it being caused being an impromptu lie detector test. I can see why Pam becomes unlikable to some. 

Creed remains great.

I get they probably decided on ""butts"" so they could show it without having to blur anything which ironically made it less clear he hated her mural. 

So they added, ""THIS SUCKS"" to the right of the butts. 

This was just incredibly dumb to me. Also, the butts were so cartoonish.

foim1v,VeseliM,"The Office ended on episode 9 of season 9, the Dwight Christmas episode.","Getting to the end of a re-watch right now, I've always been a defender of seasons 8 and 9. I would always say it shifted to more of an ensemble where the characters could grow after Carell left. 

This sub however has opened me to the flaws of the later seasons; Andy's weird arc where he basically goes crazy, the Jim and Pam marriage issues, all the Philly nonsense, breaking the 4th wall with the camera crew, the boom mike guy. I get the complaints. Mindy and bj had left in season 9. Shure was developing the Farm and working on Parks. Nbc was demanding a full 22.

Today I realized none of those flaws are present until after the Christmas episode. Andy has just grown up and taken responsibility for his family, Jim and Dwight are at a high point in their friendship, the characters are blossoming, Jim goes off to Philly for his dream job at the end of the episode.

Some of the episodes in the latter half of seasons 9 are hilarious, but if you consider the Christmas episode as the end of the show, it's very satisfying.",2,1585103812,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/foim1v/the_office_ended_on_episode_9_of_season_9_the/,DunderMifflin,1

foex3j,Captain_Scarblade,Season 9 - honest opinions,"I love the show as a whole but I think season 9 was by far the worst in the series. 

The jokes were fine and the callbacks to previous seasons were okay for the most part.


Anyone else think the intentional sabotaging of the office couples was too much? Like I get the whole Angela and the senator stuff. But the constant fighting between Pam and Jim? The lack of respect for Andy‚Äôs relationship with Erin and ultimately them being broken up with for good? I think that was unnecessary to end their arc not together and just completely mess with Andy‚Äôs character in general. He went to Florida from Pennsylvania to get Erin back. You mean to tell me Andy and Erin didn‚Äôt legit love each other? 
They added two new characters but they were like young clones of the original. They could‚Äôve done this but made them not so unlikable and intruding on the other original office employees. 

I just went through a rewatch and this season has been particularly hard to get through. I remember this airing on tv and even then I lost a lot of interest by this point in the show. It just seems like they actually could‚Äôve done better by Andy‚Äôs character and the show as a whole.",3,1585089827,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/foex3j/season_9_honest_opinions/,DunderMifflin,1

Each character is so bland, people Are complex the shows writing can't even show the true characteristics of a person.

Then when it shows Roy walk up to the circle and they say they are playing ""Who would you do"" he says ""what's the name of that tight ass Christian chick?... Oh, hey Angela"".

fnohzu,InsertNameHere1337,I can't like Michael,"I understand that loads of people love him so much, and he does have redemptive moments in which he shows that he's not a terrible person and can be quite nice. 

But I do not like him. 

In my opinion, he alternates between acting like a toddler who forever puts his own petty desires above the needs of others, and behaving like a misogynistic idiot who wants everyone else to love him when he doesn't deserve it. 

I know that's part of his character, and I also know that he has moments where he tries to do the right think. His relationship with Holly is very sweet, and he gets treated horribly by Jan - who is absolutely awful. 

But the way he treats Pam, Jim and the office throughout the series - even in the later seasons when he supposedly gets better - is just so ridiculously childish, rude and selfish. He really should have been fired, or at least properly punched in the face, before he finally left the show. 

Anyway, I'm just venting. I hope I'm not being too negative.",12,1584986286,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fnohzu/i_cant_like_michael/,DunderMifflin,1

Robert California's grown on me a bit as i've hit a management position irl so i can empathise a bit with the frustration of having to manage losers but having to show positive results. 
 
Andy is butchered, Erin is cringy(i liked the same character in unbreakable kimmy shmidt but she felt so out of place in the office).   
Nellie bertram is just...odd? like they took a character from the office UK and transplanted her into the office US but decided to do so waaay later than appropriate. She doesn't have any fun interactions with anyone.   

Clark/Erin feels like revenge from the writers for Ed helms Hangover success.Clark could've been replaced by Ryan and no one would notice.

* Jim and Pam - Jim can be smart and cool and Pam can be sweet but they can also be assholes especially to Dwight. And the pranks seem so elaborate, unrealistic and not funny. 
* Dwight - I normally like weird characters but Dwight is sometimes too strange and creepy. Also, I hate how unrealistically gullible he is to some of Jim's pranks even though he should be a pretty smart guy. Plus, I hate anything to do with the farm .

Question though... I haven‚Äôt seen much coverage on this. I‚Äôve had this in my calendar for a while and heard nothing. 

What network is to be broadcasting it or streaming platform? Has anyone heard any news? Google was barren of updates. Thanks!

Hopefully it marginally resembles *The Office* circa season 4. The plot centers around how Dunder Mifflin Scranton would handle the swine flu, which was spreading and scaring everyone at the time, so it's kinda...relevant? It's no *Threat Level Midnight*, but I at least hope it's not too long for you.

fmni9n,Tacokitten7,"Okay, so I‚Äôm gonna go on a small tangent here for a moment, and it‚Äôs about how Parks and Rec is actually a good show, and I don‚Äôt know why everyone hates it, but if that will trigger you, then don‚Äôt click obviously.","Okay, so I always see people on both this subreddit, other subreddits, and instagram telling people how stupid Parks and Recreation is, and I just don‚Äôt get it. People‚Äôs reasoning for disliking the show is arbitrary. People say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a ripoff of the office.‚Äù Well number one, just Becuase it‚Äôs a comedy show set in an office building (I know it‚Äôs a government building, but it‚Äôs a similar type of space) doesn‚Äôt make it a ripoff. Second, the show was created by both Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, who you might know also created The Office. So are you surprised that maybe there are some similarities? Yeah, they both do the talking head thing, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a ripoff. Both shows are in the same universe. It‚Äôs probably just the same company that did the doc series on The Office: An American Workplace doing another doc series there. Heck, they said in a deleted scene on the finale that they were doing new ones in places like an oil rig, so it‚Äôs not that far fetched. Also, most of the characters are totally different. April and Andy are both probably two of the funniest characters in television history, and have no counterparts in The Office. The rest of the characters may have some similarities to an Office character, but none are exact parallels. Jerry/Gary/Larry May be the closest to Toby, but even then, Toby is someone who is trying to enforce the rules in the building, and Jerry is just a klutz who everyone makes fun of. Basically, the show isn‚Äôt just a ripoff.

Another point I hear often is ‚ÄòI tried the show, and I didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äô And then I ask what episodes they watched, and they say just the first one, or just the first season. This also annoys me, Becuase the first season, especially the first episode, is honestly pretty crap in my opinion. I don‚Äôt like it. The first episode especially is just not funny almost at all, except for Leslie faking in the pit. At least I think that was the first episode. Anyway, if you‚Äôre going to watch Parks and Rec, just like I would advise you with The Office, skip the first season. Start watching with the second season right off the bat. You won‚Äôt miss anything that it won‚Äôt catch you up on itself.

Conclusion: if you‚Äôve actually tried out the show from the second season and you just don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs completely fine. But I urge you, if you‚Äôre one of those that blindly hates this show because others do, or because it‚Äôs a ripoff, or because you tried the first season, give the show another chance. You might like what you see.",13,1584827263,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fmni9n/okay_so_im_gonna_go_on_a_small_tangent_here_for_a/,DunderMifflin,1

fmhop3,Averagejoee1990,Season 8 Rewatch,"This may be a hot take, but I thoroughly enjoy season 8 right up until Episode 19 ‚ÄúGet the Girl.‚Äù  The final 6 episodes of the season are almost unbearable.

‚Ä¢ Andy at the beginning of the season works pretty well.  He‚Äôs endearing, he‚Äôs somewhat competent, he‚Äôs caring as a boss.
‚Ä¢ Dwight becomes the star of the show.  Seasons 8-9 arguably feature some of Dwight‚Äôs best moments.
‚Ä¢ The Florida episodes are pretty great. Packer and Gabe at their best!
‚Ä¢ Robert California initially has a fantastic dynamic with everyone.  The pool party episode is one of his more memorable episodes.  However, this dynamic is lost after episode 19 in large part because the show paints him as an antagonist to Andy.  
‚Ä¢ Oscar and Darryl gain bigger roles and have moments to shine.

I know the final two seasons get a lot of hate, I just wanted to defend them a bit on some grounds.  Cheers to another rewatch over this quarantine!",0,1584808395,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fmhop3/season_8_rewatch/,DunderMifflin,1

fm4xuk,ABWitty,Pros and Cons of Donating Blood:,"Pros:

Save Lives

Get out of camping with your boss

Get free cookies

Meet the love of your life

 Cons:

Feel like a human juice box, type-O...cean Spray

So nervous you didn't eat for three days

Talking with stragers about hats full of soup

Considering these lists, I hope you will consider donating blood with an hour of your spare time. There is a nationwide shortage of blood because people are too scared to go out. This is a small but vitally important and tangible way that you can make a positive impact. Please consider making a life-saving donation to your **local blood center** (not the Red Cross, which price-gouges patients and hospitals). And yes, Jim, there is a limit to how much you can donate. Usually every eight weeks for a whole-blood donation.",0,1584746332,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fm4xuk/pros_and_cons_of_donating_blood/,DunderMifflin,1
fm4wtg,theDahlSack,Who Looks Next - Drinking Game,"This game is for people who maybe aren‚Äôt as familiar with the show and veterans alike.  It requires just some common knowledge of the characters and some guessing (even for super fans of the show).  There are some basic rules and can be played with shots or sips of wine or beer.  (Shots if you need a quick game).  

Players 2-5
Rules:
1) Opening Round, Each player will start out by picking a character that they think will look at the camera(not cameraman) next.

2) For 2 or 3 players, each player may pick only one character each. For 4-5 only two people may pick the same character.
Any character on the show goes

3) The losers of the round will drink and they also get to pick the characters in the next round first.  If nobody picks correctly then everyone loses.   Losers pick first every round and if everyone loses then it‚Äôs a free for all, haven‚Äôt gotten that far yet

4) Confessionals or one-on-one with the cameras do not count as looks

Super fun, my girlfriend and I made it trying to get ready to go out by ourselves lol.  I tried to see the other drinking games for The Office and I think this one is a bit different from those.

He knew how to motivate his team, with the ass tattoo and (to a much lesser extent because it was mainly Jim,) the work bus. 

The biggest point to his credit, though, was that he (whether it was intentional or not, probably not) allowed the branch to do whatever they wanted. He just sat back, went sailing for 3 months, and did nothing. The branch had outstanding numbers during that quarter. 

Even if he didn‚Äôt mean to be a hands-off manager, and was just being an idiot when he took the boat, he definitely made the branch a lot more successful.

flw0lk,DonFred12,Possible unpopular opinion but the awkwardness of Scott's Tots is overrated,"So COVID-19 and the ensuing self-isolation has been a welcome opportunity for me to re-watch The Office for the 11th time (as if I wasn't planning on doing that exact thing with or without a global pandemic). But anyhow, I finally reached the dreaded Season 6 episode 12, otherwise known as Scott's Tots. 

I realized I hadn't really watched this episode since like my third rewatch. I would always skip it because I just remembered it being so horribly awkward and cringey and I couldn't deal with that. And from what I had read through the years this episode is pretty universally regarded as the all time most awkward/cringey/horrible episode, which just reinforced my feelings towards it. But for some reason I decided to watch it this time around, maybe because the global situation we're in has made me a masochist I don't know. 

All throughout I braced myself for the horribleness that would soon unfold, but it never really materialized fully. Don't get me wrong the whole situation is messed up which adds to the uncomfortable nature of the episode, and there are some very awkward moments. But these are all in the build up to Michael's announcement, which kind-of makes it not that bad I feel, especially since Michael is enjoying it sort of. 

When Michael finally tells them he's not paying, the reaction is not deafening silence with Michael trying to rescue the situation, which in my head would be 10x more awkward, but instead instant yelling and screaming. I just feel sympathy for Michael especially because he is so open and honest with them, and really takes it in stride. The laptop-batteries are to me just hilarious and not really cringey, I almost peed myself laughing. 

After watching this episode I couldn't help but feel like I might've missed something because that wasn't the cringefest I remembered it being, so I rewatched it again to pay even closer attention this time, but funnily enough it was the same. 

I guess what I'm trying to say with this way-longer-than-intended-post is that I'm not sure that Scott's Tots is actually the most cringey and awkward episode of our favorite show. I would argue that it maybe doesn't even crrack my top 5 episode in this regard. I would have Phyllis' Wedding, Andy's Play, Diwali, Dinner Party and Night Out all ahead of Scotts Tots I think.

I don't know if that's crazy.   
Are there anyone else that feels the same? Or am I just becoming immune to Michael Scott shenanigans through countless rewatchings?  


Sorry for the long post. If you made it this far you are all deserving of a Schrute Buck or a Stanley Nickel, whichever your local grocery shop accepts.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr the awkwardness in Scott's Tots is not fully blown and in your face for most of the episode, and the indirectness of the awkwardness makes it more bearable. When the awkwardness is finally fully developed it resolved pretty quickly. Consequently, I therefore feel the episode is overrated in terms of the level of awkwardness and cringeness it is so infamous for.",6,1584714921,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/flw0lk/possible_unpopular_opinion_but_the_awkwardness_of/,DunderMifflin,1

flk2jn,starista,The Michael Scott Podcast Company/Episode 57,"""...the office is such a comfortable blanket..""

I was first introduced to this amazing show when I was suffering the miscarriage of our first baby.  After the medical procedure, I was in bed and inconsolable.  My steady, resilient husband would lay next to me and watch The Office on an old Dell laptop.  He'd watch episode after episode.  One day I flipped over and laughed.  We connected, cuddled, and binge watched as much as we could, as we were early in season 4, I think. 

Fast forward to March 2020.  We have an amazing third grade son.  I'm a fifth grade teacher in a neighboring district.  We move to distance learning on Monday.  I've been driving to and from school daily listening to the news, NPR, etc. 

Today there was a heavy, steady snow and (despite the studded snow tires and AWD) I was nervous driving in.  The roads are practically empty.  Rather than listen to the latest Covid-19 update I tuned into this wonderful podcast.  It helped me get to school and get together the resources I need to provide engaging and meaningful lessons for my class of amazing students.

As was the case over a decade ago, I needed the humor that only The Office can provide. 

Thank you,

A Teacher and Mama in norther New England

Jim's one joke fell totally flat. Spiderface? Doesn't even make sense out of context. I feel like Jim could have had soo many better jokes than that.

Pam's internet scam, ehh really weak. And the great delegator joke was really lame. And also kind of a cheap and lazy shot at his dick size. (And they act like she came up with the iPod shuffle quip on the spot, please.)

Oscar was really just yelling at him and Meredith was just listing bad shit he's done to her.

i found jenna‚Äôs vlog of the ‚Äúbooze cruise‚Äù episode, and she is always with john. and in one clip she leans on his shoulder. and in the bloopers, there is a scene where john basically jumps onto jenna and hugs her on the couch. 

even if it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù do you think they were ‚Äúfriends with benefits‚Äù or ‚Äúhooked up‚Äù?

fl9sy9,guitaristnate,"I always thought that Mark, (Played by Bob Odenkirk), should get his own spinoff series.","As we all know, In season nine, Pam visits Simon Reality to interview for ‚ÄúOffice Manager‚Äù, which she finds out is really just a glorified title for a receptionist position at this company. The actual manager who interviews her is Mark, (player by Bob Odenkirk), who she immediately likens to Michael Scott. While, I did think that he had certain character traits that were similar to Michael‚Äôs, I felt that Odenkirk portrayed this character as more of an amalgam of both Michael Scott and David Brent‚Äôs personalities. 

A highlight of this scene is when Mark introduces Pam to her ‚Äúfuture‚Äù co-workers. One of the hilarious character interactions that happens while Pam is being introduced is between Mark and his employee Roger (cameo played by Michael Weston). My favorite part about this interaction is how Roger seems so jaded and over Marks shit. With the exception of Mark, every Simon Reality character that is introduced has a screen time of less than ten seconds, but they all manage to convey that there‚Äôs an entire hilarious backstory to this company under Marks management. 

It‚Äôs common knowledge amongst fans of the U.S. version of The Office that Odenkirk originally auditioned for the part of Michael Scott. While I‚Äôm happy that the part of Michael Scott went to Steve Carell, I feel that Odenkirk could bring his own flair to a spinoff of the series while also combining attributes of Scott and Brent, as he hilariously showed off in the episode. If there‚Äôs ever to be a continuation or spinoff of the series, I think that it should be an examination of Simon Reality under management of Mark as played by Odenkirk ‚Äî along with all of the hilarious characters that were introduced.",7,1584623550,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fl9sy9/i_always_thought_that_mark_played_by_bob_odenkirk/,DunderMifflin,1

2. Ryan, I think we all know Ryan is a shitbag and honestly the show was better when he was mia

3. Kelly and Erin are tied for being obnoxious dumb and easily forgotten 

4. Angela hypocrite, asshole, control freak, overly religious, creepy with cats, was shitty to Dwight and Andy

5. Season 3 and 9 Andy + when he goes to get Erin in S8 the other seasons he is tolerable or even likable 

6. Michael he is arrogant, selfish, and cringey as hell but even though his scenes and actions were crap I liked how his character kept the show on a nice entertaining pace",44,1584568007,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkxvuy/the_most_hated_characters_imo/,DunderMifflin,4

fktmf2,justntimejustin,"Martin Nash, The Convict","Martin was one of the Stamford transfers who in the episode, ""The Convict"", everyone found out was a felon. He admits that he got busted for insider trading but it seemed like he was in the accounting department, especially if his background is in finance. As an accountant myself, that seems impossible that he would ever be allowed access company's ledger ever again let alone their actual finances. If you get busted laundering money, doing insider trading, etc. you're basically done in finance at that point. It's like having a DUI and applying to drive a school bus, people just won't trust you.

So I guess my question is, was Martin an accountant for Dunder Mifflin? I know it's a tv show but I'm quarantined and bored so humor me. And also yes, I've seen the theories that Kevin (and possibly others) were laundering money and/or doing insider trading through DM.",4,1584553331,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fktmf2/martin_nash_the_convict/,DunderMifflin,1
fktg40,thejp0925,What Happened to Toby?,"We all seem to agree that Andy was ruined in Season 9. But what the hell happened to Toby?

The majority of the time we see Toby in the later seasons, it seems he's either acting creepy and pathetic towards women, or being really geeky and annoying by rambling about his Chad Flenderman novels or the Scranton Strangler trial, or something like that. Why? This isn't the Toby that we originally met. Toby always occurred to me as a nice, down-to-earth guy. He could even be really funny or helpful sometimes. Sure, he was always timid and awkward, and definitely creepy with Pam sometimes, but he never meant it. Even in the infamous scene where he grabs Pam's thigh, he obviously realizes instantly that he's being creepy, and flees. You feel bad for him, because you know he just got carried away.

Toby's character was originally so great because he represented common sense and accountability, which made him a foil to Michael. As the HR rep, Toby was always the one to call Michael out on his BS,  and so the interactions between the two would highlight what a selfish, irrational idiot Michael was. All of Michael's famous one-liners and insults towards Toby are so hilarious because the anger behind them is so representative of Michael's contempt for authority and responsibility. The fact that he responds to the slightest expectation of accountability with such anger and defensiveness is a huge part of what makes him so funny. It draws attention to just how ridiculous and idiotic he really is. He's threatened by good people with basic morals, just because they try to get in the way of his selfishness.

When Michael left, it seems the writers wanted to keep the whole ""Toby sucks"" gag running. I don't blame them, because Michael's Toby insults were and still are some of the most quoted lines from the show. There was just one problem, though: **with Michael** **gone, there was no reason to hate Toby anymore.** Toby wasn't actually a bad person; Michael only hated him so much because he stood in the way of his destructive behavior. As ridiculous as the other characters on the show could be, none of them tried to violate the rules and morals of the company as much as Michael did, so there weren't any reasons for Toby to intervene, and thus, no room for those classic Toby insults. He was just a likable, nice guy without Michael.

To remedy this problem, it seems the writers simply... made Toby more hate-able. He turned from a sweet but slightly timid and awkward guy into a creep who annoyed everybody with his boring tangents. This made it justifiable for the other characters in the show to insult him, just as Michael did. But was it worth it? I hardly think so. Even though this change in Toby's character gave us more one-liners about how much he sucked, they were never anywhere close to as funny as Michael's. His insults weren't funny in and of themselves; what made them so funny was how extreme they were, given that Toby had merely tried to enforce basic rules and common sense. When you invert that dynamic and make it so Toby actually deserves to be insulted, you lose that irony. The insults were sometimes mildly funny when they were particularly well-written, but that's it. Plus, the things they'd have Toby say in order to warrant the insults often just felt unnecessary. He sucked, but it didn't illuminate anything about him or the other characters or the show as a whole. He just sucked for the sake of sucking. However cleverly written the insults were, they were never worth the displeasure and discomfort of having to listen to him talk.

To me, this is really unfortunate, because in the earlier seasons, Toby could be one of my favorite characters at his best. Think about when he laughed at Michael's diary during The Deposition, or when he showed Pam how to punch someone so she could punch Michael, or when he laughed at Michael for falling into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall, or how he moved away from Kelly because he ""had an allergy"". These are all great, funny scenes. Toby was often someone the viewers could relate to, like a Jim, or a Pam, or a Ryan (early on). We don't get that Toby later on, and I think that's really unfortunate.

My theory is David Wallace was promised a share of profits from the documentary, and he was smart enough to understand that Micheal is the most prominent part to get there.
This theory also assumes another theory that the Scranton branch was most profitable owing to contributions from the documentary crew to keep the shoot running.

When M√≠che√°l quit, it was eventually David's idea to offer to buy back this firm and absorb him.
When David quit and became rich, and eventually got a chance to invest in the company he did it even though he knew it was a sinking  ship, hoping to make the quick buck via the documentary.",9,1584538034,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkphtn/theory_david_wallaces_golden_egg_was_the/,DunderMifflin,1

2) that being said, i think michael and erin would make a good couple. for starters, they each comfort each other all the time, like when michael leaves to go to colorado, he says to her ‚Äòif you ever need anything, you have my phone number.‚Äô and when michael storms out of the room at the christmas party and holly tries to go after him, erin stops her, then makes michael feel batter. secondly- (secondly?) yes, toby. secondly. god! secondly, they just make each other laugh at least once every other episode. even after erin got stressed after michael told her about andy being engaged to angela, he makes her feel better and laugh when he tells her about and impersonates his neighbor tom dizemore. i mean they are just perfect for each other and they dont see it.",3,1584504065,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkjcr9/there_are_2_things_on_the_agenda_for_this/,DunderMifflin,1

fkgsy1,gazil9,[Unpopular Opinion] Corporate's TV ad was way better than Michael's.,"Don't get me wrong. I love Michael's ad. It's quirky, fun, and oddly endearing. But it only works if you already know all of the Dunder Mifflin employees. In order to compete with the big office chains like Office Depot, Dunder Mifflin has to show its strength: great customer service. When Dwight and Jim go on sales call in Traveling Salesmen episode (S03E13), they highlighted how quickly Kelly picked up her phone to answer any customer service calls. This is exactly what corporate wants to show through its TV ads. And unfortunately, Michael's ad doesn't show that.",8,1584493175,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkgsy1/unpopular_opinion_corporates_tv_ad_was_way_better/,DunderMifflin,1

Is it solely because he is the boss that takes over after Steve Carell or is it just that reason? I very much prefer Deangelo Vickers over any manager following Michael except Dwight. My favorite dynamic was the Andy being the Office Funny Guy. To me Nellie is by far the worst character in the show and even when we learned about her past I still was unable to like the character in any way.

fkewr2,CheetoCrust,"Fan Theory made by me and my brother connecting The office, Parks and rec, Brooklyn 99, and The blacklist","In the Office Season 9 episode 15 Andy sings the theme to New girl and New girl as we know has a crossover episode with Brooklyn 99 meaning that in The office, Brooklyn 99 and New girl are tv shows. While this might be just a fun fact I have also worked on spreading this theory farther by saying that Toby (Scranton Strangler) attempts to kill Karen Filippelli as revenge to Jim for dating Pam. Karen survives and joins witness protection which then takes her to Pawnee Indiana under the name Ann Perkins. While this happens Robert California notices that If David Wallace buys their company. Dunder Mifflin would be famous again meaning that he would get exposed in front of the public that he is CEO, so he leaves as soon as David bought their company and changes his name to Raymond Reddington (The Blacklist). (In the Office he says that he likes doodling list‚Äôs much like Raymond does). Also in Brooklyn 99 Ed Helms plays a character meaning that Andy Bernard finally became a famous actor. 


Edit: Btw I am aware that the shows have cameos by the actors such as Andy Samberg appearing in Park and rec, but maybe once the documentary aired they chose to hire him to play in a show and the same with the other actors",6,1584485751,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkewr2/fan_theory_made_by_me_and_my_brother_connecting/,DunderMifflin,1

fkev4j,Stompin14,"The opening of ‚ÄúNew Boss‚Äù episode about Michaels Party shows the real relationship of Michael, Jim &amp; Pam","On my one millionth rewatch the episode ‚ÄúNew boss‚Äù happened. It starts with Michael, Dwight, Pam and Jim (who is in a tux) talking about Michaels Party and the art of being classy.

I talked about how Michael and Jim have some of the realest moments on the show. Jim knows it‚Äôs all insanity and plays along with Michael. We see that since the first season. Michael uses crazy scenarios to relive stress but is definitely aware of what‚Äôs going on.

The conversation is a perfect example. When Jim says Dwight isn‚Äôt being classy because he says they should have an ice sculpture with chocolate covered strawberries around it.

Jim then turns and says something along the lines of well we should have an ice sculpture with an assortment of chocolate covered fruits around it. 

Then Michael suggests strawberries and Dwight storms out. That is 100% Michael joining in to troll Dwight and just laugh everything off.

Then Pam, Michael and Jim laugh it off talking about the definition of classy.

If I was just watching the show I would think Michael is just dumb but funny and easily influenced. It‚Äôs not though, he is just straight up having fun with Jim and Pam because they know Dwight is ridiculous.

Every now and then the ridiculous Michael Scott mask slips and we see just a normal guy in this hysterical/dysfunctional position.

fkc55k,JasonSimons,Kevins Magic Number is Why Michael Scott was a Successful Manager,"I'm sure some will say this is super obvious but I only got this on like my hundredth time watching....

Michael Scott is able to maintain consistent sales records even in times of intense economic turmoil. From the 2008 crash, to the general big chains he keeps on winning. Hes even brought in to give a speech as the most profitable branch manager.

In the last season Kevin is fired. Hes fired for his magic accounting number (use of sleven gets you home by eleven). It got me thinking, they must have really owed a lot of money once it was found out. 

What if the branch under M Scott was actually doing terrible... but because of Kevins magic number it looked like they were doing great! 

The saber bookkeeper who came to check it out was so distracted by michael and dwight he didnt catch it etc.

SO much adds up here. Its why the heads of Saber would spend so much time at those branches. Trying to figure out what they were doing right etc.",13,1584475863,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/fkc55k/kevins_magic_number_is_why_michael_scott_was_a/,DunderMifflin,2

I think she knew she was going to see pam so she wanted to make her jealous for liking jim. She might've put a bowl in her shirt, but that's my guess.

Why did they get rid of karen as a main person? Because she was busy being another person

She changed her name and identity because she wanted a fresh start. Her being utika manager was probably an andy season 9 situation where the boss didn't know she was gone. Then after lecture circut, she was fired for being gone too often.
