fso8re,TheDoggydog23,"Giving Away Free Nintendo Switch Lite with Animal Crossing New Horizons and Pokemon Shield, read post for details!","Proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/iEiO29i

My local hospital is not accepting donations that have been opened due to the quarantine. I have picked up copies of Animal Crossing and Pokemon Shield that will be included, instead of waiting months for the hospital to not be quarantined anymore I want to give to someone deserving and hopefully a fan of Animal Crossing (or Pokemon).

Please post below about how getting this will change your life for the better and why you deserve it. As mentioned please don't say to donate it as I cannot right now and want to give to someone directly. I am able to ship anywhere in the world but if you say you have cancer or something along those lines be prepared to provide proof before I send as I am not going to be scammed by someone making up their difficult situation. You can message me directly if you don't feel comfortable sharing details of your story below. I will only post the Reddit name of who gets it and why I feel they deserved it, but I won't give any of the proof or any specific details someone gives for privacy. 

I will read every single comment and will choose who I think needs it the most in their life to bring some happiness. I will give it 1 week and will pick next Wednesday at 8 PM Eastern timezone. I have the original box and will be able to pack exactly how it came. I have only played several times now for a total of less than an hour and it is in perfect condition.",284,1585698419,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fso8re/giving_away_free_nintendo_switch_lite_with_animal/,NintendoSwitch,13

fsmpoj,HibikiRush,Anyone have their SD card reader slot repaired?,"Last week my Switch would occasionally give me an error message that the memory card had been removed and the system needed to turn off. Didn't think much of it until a few days ago it started showing me an error message saying, ""Unable to access MicroSD card"" and completely stopped acknowledging the card.

Ordered another replacement card, gives me the same error message, and with the SD reader I received with the replacement card I realized the old card works fine on my computer. So it looks like this is a hardware problem.

Has anyone sent in their Switch for repair to have the SD card reader module replaced? If so, do they format or retain all the data on the console?

I really like the Concept of the Switch especially as someone who has to travel a lot but somehow most Switch Games dont click for me. For Exempel botw is an awful game for me since i lack the creativity for open world games.

On the other hand i really hate games which only run at 30 fps, since im a former PC gamer with a 144hz Monitor.

Maybe u guys have some suggestions for me what to Play.

The Game Needs to run at 60fps.

Furthermore i dont like jrpg or open world games.

I like grinding games like diablo, WoW and Co. but also like Competitive games like LoL, first person shooter or strategy games in general.

fsm4oj,meriweather2,"Help with Family Membership, Child Accounts, and Multiple Switches","A family member told me that they have open slots on a Family NSO Membership they just bought, and they would be happy to let my kids onto their membership so they can visit each other on ACNH. I'm not sure how to do this. 

We have a main family Switch set as my primary for purchasing, and I have a Switch Lite as secondary. My account has an Individual NSO Membership, and my kids have profiles on our main Switch but not NSO. Two of them have Child Accounts under my family group, but I honestly don't think that's affected much if anything since we created them. One of them just has a profile, and she doesn't do anything different.

All of the instructions I've found about adding accounts to a family membership involving putting in an email. Is there a way to use their existing Child Accounts, or do they need new accounts with emails to be added? Does it matter that the Child Accounts are under my group but would be under a different family's member's NSO Membership?

Also, they are saving up for individual Switch Lites. Will they need their own regular accounts anyway once they get their own handhelds? (I know their ACNH data is stuck on our original Switch.) We have my profile signed in on both consoles now so we can share digital copies (we have some physicals and some digitals), but I don't know if that will keep working out after we expand.

Any help would be appreciated. I love that my family wants to expand our ability to play together, but I'm a little confused on how to ""level up"" this way.",0,1585691339,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsm4oj/help_with_family_membership_child_accounts_and/,NintendoSwitch,3
fsm3ss,ApolloollopA,Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Lost Island,"I have a quick question. So on Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you can’t have islands. And I share a Switch with a sibling of mine. When we got the team, I opened it first, not knowing that everything would be on my island. Once I was done playing, my sibling got on, and found out that they can only play on my island.

Though today, the turns have tabled. It’s like the game reset. So when my sibling opened the game, they were able to make an island, and when I played after them, I was only able to play on their island. Does anyone know what the cause of this is? It still says that the save data from my island is saved.

fskzjr,DecentPlate,Coming back to Nintendo after a long PlayStation hiatus.,"So I’ve been a PlayStation guy since 2007. I grew up with Nintendo though and always loved it but since then I have not bought a single Nintendo product in 13 years. I was definitely a Zelda kid and I can still throw down in Super Smash if someone hands me a controller. I think in my head I loved more hardcore games but now since getting older I’m starting to be less drawn to shooter games. 

As I’m getting older (24) I’m shifting my priorities and I think it would be healthier to give up those types of games. I still like to game but I want to dial it back. The switch seems like a little more casual and positive and I feel like it fits more into the life I want to live. I only play games like once or twice a week and I think the switch would accommodate that lifestyle a lot better.

So they still are getting restocked ESPECIALLY the lites. Im seeing them from 550-800 and it pisses me off. At a time like this ppl need a getaway. So keep trying on best buy. Get the refreshing plugin. Sit there on ur computer and wait. It wont be long before the order comes through.

fsjma6,adamTHEman95,I've been a Switch owner for about a month and I'm extremely satisfied but one game release will make me a full convert.(My thoughts),"TL;DR at the bottom!

I've been gaming on Xbox consoles for the last 3 gens and I haven't had the urge to grab another console until the Switch and Pokemon Sword sold me. Coupled with the lack of quality first party content from MS this gen, I pulled the trigger and finally indulged my Nintendo cravings. I am having an absolute blast! I binged through Sword in a few days and can't wait for the dlc, already put 30 hours into Smash, having tons of fun with my brother and friends, and am currently alternating between Dragon Quest 11 and Mario Odyssey.

I also have BOTW but haven't played it yet because; 1. I want to finish DQ11 and 2. I can already tell that game is going to consume my life so I'm holding off until I beat a couple games. Oh yeah and Mario Odyssey is my first 3D Mario game and it's fucking immaculate!

&amp;#x200B;

I say all this to say, in this past month, even with extra time from being quarantined in my house, I've been neglecting my Xbox with no sign of slowing down. However there is one thing making me boot up my Xbox occasionally, and that is multiplayer shooters. Specifically for me, Overwatch and COD. Halo used to be my goto but I wasn't that fond of 5 and am waiting to see what Infinite has in store.  Lol it's not as if I want my Xbox to die or I'm never going to play a new Halo/multiplat shooter on my Xbox, but damn would it be nice to get all my fixes on my neat little console/handheld hybrid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what you're thinking, Overwatch is already on the Switch and don't pick up a Nintendo console for multiplayer shooters. Well I do plan on getting Overwatch for my Switch, however I doubt it'll overtake my main account and while I didn't buy my Switch specifically for shooters, it sure wouldn't hurt to have em! And there's one game I played on my cousins Gamecube waaay back in the day, that I have fond memories of that could scratch my Shooter/Halo itch and you should know where I'm going with this.

**Metroid**

If Metroid Prime 4 ends up being as good as Nintendo's other pillar franchise with online multiplayer as fun as it was on the Gamecube, it would literally seal the deal for the Switch for me. With Zelda, Mario and finally Metroid released and thriving on the Switch, ALL my of gaming needs are covered and I don't think I'll ever put this machine down! 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway that's my experience with the Switch, as well as my hope's for the future! Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR If Metroid Prime 4 drops and is as good as previous entries, all my bases would be covered. *Single Player RPG*: Zelda, *3D Platformer*: Mario, *Story/Multiplayer Shooter*: Metroid. Sprinkle in all the other big hits on Switch and I'm a damn satisfied customer!!",11,1585683389,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsjma6/ive_been_a_switch_owner_for_about_a_month_and_im/,NintendoSwitch,0

She has animal crossing  and ideally wants to keep her save but the lack of cloud saves makes that hard. I also am not currently living with her so it makes it difficult to handle sending it off for repairs.

Should I contact the store for an exchange or is it worth contacting the service centre which might take longer than usual due to covornavirus.

fsiw5x,BennyTheBeardedGamer,Pokémons transition to Nintendo Switch,"Okay, first ever Reddit post. Read the rules and I will do my best to follow them, please leave me a comment or a message if I’m breaking any rules. 

So I’m the happy owner of a Nintendo Switch(who would have guessed), and a long time Pokémon fan. I’ve played for more than 20 years, since Pokémon Red and Blue came to Europe. 

The original games have always followed a certain recipe and they have added a few things, but they really haven’t added much. 

Until the Switch came. I played Pokémon Shield first and it’s not because I was disappointed, but I felt like something was missing? First thought was that it felt really wierd that every member of your team got exp, every time you defeated s Pokémon. My Pokémons rose in levels, so fast that I was 10-20 levels above every trainee, gym or rival that I met. It was so easy, and I barely used more than the first in my party and I never used any potions. Normally, there’s a lot of grindind it you want a specific Pokémon, because you have to train that certain Pokémon and get to that evolution you want. You have had the chance of using the exp. share, but still, all six party members didn’t get exp every time. 

Another thing I found really wierd, was the fact that the cities and the routes are so small and short, with almost no interaction or side quests. No real stort beside you being a gym challenger and having a rival. After gym number 8, a little more came, but still, there were no fun caves, buildings, puzzles or any of that charme that the older games had. 
Everything is given to you, you don’t have to do someone a favor to get surf, strenght, fly etc, and get onwards in the game, everything is just kinda mellow.

So after I finished Shield, I bought Let’s go Pikachu. 
I was sure that they couldn’t have made any differences there, but I was wrong. You don’t even battle wild Pokémons, I was shocked to be honest. I don’ just want to be throwing balls and berries like we’re in one big safari zone nightmare. 
I actually haven’t even made it to first gym, because I think it lost something. I probably will take it out of the case and play it, but I think they lost the magic to be honest. 

I hope they go back to the original style and just make games that way. Maybe even make all the old games again onto the switch, I would love that. 

What do you guys think? Am I just an old man, who lost track of time and hate new things, or do you see the same as I do?",45,1585681149,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsiw5x/pokémons_transition_to_nintendo_switch/,NintendoSwitch,5

From my googling, others experience a louder pitch that sometimes involves their TV/speakers and some had a few varying solutions that didn’t resolve my sound. However, I can live with the pitch as long as it doesn’t lead to a bigger issue/harm.

So would it be okay to let the pitch continue as I play/charge it for hours? Would it cause my Switch/equipment any harm if I let the pitch go on?",5,1585671846,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsfxsy/is_it_okay_to_let_my_docked_switch_make_a_faint/,NintendoSwitch,0

fsfjsy,jasvncnt1,Help with game data transfer to new switch and nintendo eshop,"Hi all. So you have helped me before with my questions. Hopefully you can help me again. This will probably be all over the place because I don't fully understand the whole game profile and eShop. 

So..my daughter has a switch. Her sister must of had a profile on there. My daughter started playing animal crossing under her sisters profile and connected her nintendo account. Then we had some issues so she wiped all the profiles off and created her own. 

Now the issue seems when she tries so connect to eShop it brings her sisters profile back. If that makes sense. 

So here is the question. We got another switch. Before I do anything I guess I'm not sure how to proceed. 

1.  Does she create a new Nintendo account for eShop for her game profile on new switch?

2. Will that affect her game data once I figure out how to transfer it to new switch?

3. If she creates a new profile (name) on new switch does that affect her game data?

fsexq6,kdbell,Add games to Swtch wishlist from PC or mobile / view it from PC/mobile?,"Usually, when I come across new games to add to my wishlist, it is on mobile or PC. For instance, I just stumbled across the game ""Operencia"".

Going to the website, I instantly clicked ""Steam"" and Wishlisted it for Steam.

Then I clicked ""[Nintendo Eshop](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/operencia-the-stolen-sun-switch/)"" and... Nothing. It is just an info page. I am logged in with my account, but I can't wishlist or buy the game. Thanks to Corona, I am sitting close to my Switch, but normally this would be me on the way to work, and I'd forget the game at this point. After all, it's not like my backlog is getting any shorter...

Between Android, PC and Switch, that sticks out as ""We don't want your money"". Adding insult to injury, the wishlist, once opened on the Switch, can't even be sorted in any way, be it manually or by price.

Only iOS is worse, by not having a wishlist at all -- but there I can easily sidestep the limitations by using the apps ""Wshlist"" and ""PushBullet"". Since the Switch is no general-purpose device, such an option doesn't exist there.

I know there is [Dekudeals](https://www.dekudeals.com/), which even gives discount notifications. But it feels awkward to use a third-party service, that I can't use on the target device itself, for such a basic feature, so I am somehow hoping that I am just missing something.",3,1585668593,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsexq6/add_games_to_swtch_wishlist_from_pc_or_mobile/,NintendoSwitch,1

fseucx,estiface,Unlinking Nintendo Account to User,"My dilemma: when we first got our switch, we created a Nintendo account with my husbands email but linked this with my son’s User account. We figured we just needed one account and we can all use it (this is before an online account was purchased). Obviously this was wrong. 

Where we are at:
• 3 user accounts on the switch, each with significant amount of data we don’t want to lose
• my husband is unable to connect his email/Nintendo account to his user
• we are unable to unlink my husbands account from my son’s user
• unable to link my sons Nintendo account to his user
• my son is the only one that has access to Nintendo store as his user is linked to my husbands account which is primary 

Where I want to be:
• not lose any of our user data
• have each persons user be connected to the correct Nintendo account
• be able to correctly supervise our son’s Nintendo account/store capabilities
• finally upgrade to family online membership that can be managed with the parents’ accounts, not my sons. 

All in all, from my research, it seems this isn’t possible—that he only way to unlink a Nintendo account from a user is to delete the user and all their data. 

Maybe that’s my answer, but can you blame me for being desperate? These options suck.

fseoj3,spack12,Deciding between a few couch-quaratine games for the wife and I. Which of these would you recommend?,"Trying to decide between 

1. Animal Crossing 
2. Mario Party 
3. Luigis Mansion 

Little bit of context. 

My wife and I are isolated together and I’m looking for some fun games for us to pass the time together. But would also like a game that I can play alone when she doesn’t want to. I’m not generally a huge switch player, all of my online multiplayer time is on the PS4. But I enjoy the Switch for childhood throwbacks like Mario Odyssey, Pokémon, and Mario Kart. 

My wife generally isn’t a gamer at all. She plays The Sims on our MacBook, and we sometimes play Mario Kart. We also really enjoyed playing through The Room together (even though that isn’t technically multiplayer). But that’s it. 

Anyways; considering all of the games I’m looking at are still full price, I don’t really want to get all 3. 

My concern with Luigis Mansion is that it is a single player game and I worry that the co-op is kinda tacked on. That was our experience with the Mario Odyssey co-op, it wasn’t really fun to play together. But it was my absolute favourite game to play solo. 

Considering my wife loves the Sims, I assume she’ll love Animal Crossing. I can’t see myself playing it solo. But if the co-op is decent then that’s okay. I’d rather her be happy with the game than me. 

With Mario Party; my concern is the opposite. I know it’ll be fun to play 2 player co-op, but I can’t imagine either one of us jumping on solo and playing against bots. And I only have the one set of joy cons, so even when quarantine is over I don’t think it’d get much use when friends are over. Who knows though, if it’s fun enough I could get another set of joy cons. 

Just looking for your opinions. Thanks in advance everyone.",16,1585667756,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fseoj3/deciding_between_a_few_couchquaratine_games_for/,NintendoSwitch,0

fsd2x9,metalsam3,Any way to lower joy stick sensitivity?,"So recently I picked up Animal Crossing. My wife is not a gamer whatsoever, but I managed to get her to give it a try and she seems to like it. 

But there’s been one problem that is really hindering her experience, and that is the joy sticks are too sensitive for her. She ends up spending a lot of time trying to line up her character correctly to accomplish things, and often ends up missing opportunities. This leads to a lot of frustration. 

So my question is, does anybody know of any way to lower the sensitivity, know of a certain controller that’s better, or some other method/work around to lower the joystick sensitivity? She seems to have better luck with the joy cons over the pro controller, but still it’s too sensitive for her.",4,1585662007,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsd2x9/any_way_to_lower_joy_stick_sensitivity/,NintendoSwitch,1
fsd22u,alphacenturi_,Do people actually like spoilers?,"So the occasional spoiler every now and then is typical and not too surprising. However lately I've seen so many posts that were spoilers that it is far more than usual.

Now personally I love nothing more than to be pleasantly surprised by cool new releases for Switch. Thats what the various Directs and other official means provide. However browsing through the list of new posts not only ruins them all completely for me but I can't even avoid them since the spoilers, while marked as such via flair, contain the spoiler in the title and thus just reading that it is a spoiler spoils it for me!

Case in point the posts about ""Nintendo releasing remasters of various Mario games"". I don't WANT to know ahead of time what they're planning via leaks but I can't NOT see it when browsing new posts. Mario Sunshine was one of my favorite games back in the day and hearing it drop would have been incredible. Now its permanently ruined. I'm NOT excited. I'm more annoyed. 

And yes I can just unfollow but I feel that misses the point. I like to read things about the Switch especially discussions, ideas, etc. But I really don't like spoilers. At all. I'm no fan of leakers. It shows a huge betrayal of trust as its usually a person in a position to know. Speculation is one thing, but leaking is another entirely. There's nothing ""totes cool"" about it as the person doing it didnt use anything resembling skills to do so although I'm sure they'd like others to think so.",25,1585661906,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsd22u/do_people_actually_like_spoilers/,NintendoSwitch,1

fscbgg,ReeceK99,Nintendo Switch SD Card Backup,"Hello,

Just bought an SD card for my Nintendo Switch and i’m mid-way through backing up Animal Crossing to it. The “archive” method is already a pain since i’ve got to re-download it using internet, why they can’t do it locally I have no idea.

Anyway, my question is: 

1) Does this carry over all of my game data, or just the base game files?

2) In future, do my saves automatically save to my SD card, or do I have to manually back up my game save data to the SD card?

3) If I have to manually back it up every so often, how is this done? Just re-archive the game again? Surely this wouldn’t copy all 6+ GB every time?

Clueless about how these all work as i’ve not had a Nintendo since the early Nintendo DS. The way they do the “archive” for data storage seems primitive though, surely they have a better way of doing things?

Thanks in advance,

Expected stock date is between 2nd-6th April, this week. Smyths Toys is a legit business in UK but what sort of chance have i got that I'll get Ring Fit? Is the delay happening all across Europe and how many people have commented of receiving an email about this? Obviously Nintendo has declared there is a stock shortage. 

Another store, scan.co.uk has opened preorders for it. Stock date for that is 1st June. 

Should I prepare for disappointment? Is the whole not getting stock until September true? With this whole situation I am believing it is. Thanks!",5,1585648899,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fsa9eu/whats_going_on_with_ring_fit_stock_heard_it_is/,NintendoSwitch,1

fs7viw,a_wachtel,Help a Japanese language learner out,"Hello!

I'm currently looking into buying Nintendo Switch, but have some questions regarding the games' language because I want to play in Japanese. With PS4 it is usually a lot of trouble. Almost all the games that I buy in the Russian PS Store can't be played in Japanese and changing the System Language to Japanese makes them in English. So I have to import, or buy the JP PS Store cards and buy the games from a different account, etc. So how is the Switch regarding this?

1. For example, I will buy the game in the Russian Nintendo eShop with the system language set to Japanese. I heard that at least for the Animal Crossing bought in the US Nintendo eShop, in this case, the game will be in Japanese. Is it true for all the games? Or at least for any other games?
2. If I want to use the Nintendo eShop JP card and buy the game from the Japanese eShop, do I need a separate account? Or do I need to just change the region? If I change the region, can I still play the games bought in the original eShop?

For the reference, below is the partial list of games that I'm primarily interested in (including not yet released). If you have any experience with changing the language of the below games, please share. Thank you very much!

TY is a charming ps2 era platformer that’s fondly remembered for good reason. Just good simple fun with a great style. The new shadows, high resolution and solid frame rate really make the visuals pop. It’s no bottom to top remake, so don’t expect super modern visuals. Theres a few things I would have liked to see changed but for what they were going for it still looks swell in motion. 

I got it for a discount thanks to the Kickstarter but I would have totally payed full price now that I know it’s quality. Had a big smile for all my play time tonight. If you aren’t so sure but see it on a sale one day I give my full recommendations. 

I also really hope they do well and we get TY 2 and 3. Never got a chance to really try those out, and It’s a real cozy era of platformer to go back to. 

Would love to hear some more impressions of the game. If you backed it, are you happy with the end result? The backer list in the credits is MASSIVE. Was kinda surprising honestly.

This only lasts for around a minute or two, then it goes quiet until I boot/wake the system up again. Even when the fan ramps up because of high load or something, it sounds normal after the initial bout. It doesn’t get hot and I haven’t noticed any further issues so far, but do you know what the cause might be or if it’s something I should be concerned about? It’s an overseas model, so sending it to Nintendo isn’t really an option.

I’m not the most techy person and saw others, who experienced a louder static, trying to get rid of it through HDMI, tv speakers, etc. But it seems like their sounds are from tv/speakers while mine is coming directly from the Switch itself.

I’m personally ok with the faint pitch if it doesn’t mean/bring harm to my Switch.

Got it back today, brand new motherboard and joy-cons analog sticks, tried to play using her account, found out that we would have to do the game sharing magic, not a big deal tbh, but by doing so our kids would have to play using my console because I activated the game on my wife’s account, which is primarily used on their console. Not a big problem, the real one comes next

Decided to buy a copy for me, so we can play together and stuff, tried to get my save from her console, and also bought a year of NS Online because of the... wait for it... ONLINE SAVE BACKUPS

WHAT. A. PAIN.

Online save backups are not supported by ACNH, I couldn’t either transfer the saves using the manual transfer from one console to another. Last resort? Full account transfer, done that. Started the game, save wasn’t there...

Honestly this is extremely disrespectful. What’s the point of not letting your costumers decide in which console they want their saves or even having them on multiple consoles? I mean, that doesn’t require to reinvent the wheel as several companies have done that, there’s no secret in syncing that kind of any.

Honestly again, having the console hacked and giving up on online services is WAY better than the actual service they are providing at this moment. I mean not by the piracy regarding their games, but with tools like Checkpoint you can actually do a backup of your games and transfer it to another (hacked) console...",19,1585612280,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fs25tk/100_frustrated_with_big_n_save_game_decisions/,NintendoSwitch,1

(Personal Opinion),"Always found that the Starting area with its vista of the vast landscape of Hyrule and beautful looked so much more charming than the rest of what would follow. Central Hyrule with its grass and woodland could rival this a little bit, but came not close. To me personally the starting area created a promise, an atmosphere about a world, that could not be held. 

Many later settings looked downright ugly in comparison, like a drop in craftsmanship.

fs0s3z,Beafyre,Setbacks for Nintendo? Etc.,"I don't know where but last week I saw a comment on something (Can't fully remember) that basically said that it feels like Nintendo is slowing down switch releases each year. I don't agree with this sentiment but I think that right know it kind of feels that way. So let's take a look a this.

I've had the switch since almost day one. And I think we can all agree that 2017 was an amazing year for Nintendo and for us the fans. In 2018 the sentiment was that this was a slower year with a focus on Smash. And although I think last year was fine I agree that there wasn't the really big thing like a Mario Oddysey or LoZ Botw. It felt like smaller releases,
Don't get me wrong I like Luigi's Mansion 3 but it isn't one of my favorite switch games. 

I think last year can be explained by two things the Metroid Prime 4 scrap. And the Animal Crossing delay.
If those games came out last year we wouldn't have had anybody complain I think. ( Although some still would)
And this year thanks to this virus which unfortunately is affecting our planet ( A lot of support to people who are affected by it). Nintendo's plans could be ruined once more.

Currently we know nothing official for the second half of 2020. And to be honest with you that's actually more exciting than scary. At this moment almost everything is possible and that is a really cool feeling. 
I am going out on a limb here and say that we will probably have it endure a lackluster year because of the current situation. But I think there's a lot of potential for next year because of it, just Al the delayed games who end up on our switches next year is enough to get me hyped.

I want to give a compliment and thanks to Nintendo for not only giving me my favorite console of all time but for thriving despite some setbacks.

Lastly my heart goes out to everybody who is getting affected by the virus. Which is to say everybody. We will get through this together, I believe in us.

Basically the reason I'm currently thinking about this stuff is because I have a lot of free time. And I'm slowly going crazy because of being home the entire time. 

And on that note it like to have some of your thoughts on the matter.",17,1585607319,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fs0s3z/setbacks_for_nintendo_etc/,NintendoSwitch,1

It’s nowhere to be found online except a listing on Amazon that says it’s out of stock and they don’t know when they’ll have more in stock. 

The official website lists Amazon, Best Buy, and GameStop as retailers but Best Buy and GameStop don’t have a single trace of the game on their websites. I even went so far as to call both my local BB and GS. Best Buy had no idea what I was talking about and GameStop knew that the game existed but said they hadn’t received any.

I’ve reached out to both Taito and INNI games to figure this out and I’ve been ignored. I know shits fucked up in the world more than usual right now, so I’d understand a delay, but I expect atleast some form of response. 

I’m a huge Bubble Bobble fan. The NES version was one of the first video games I had ever played and one of the only games my Mom could ever get into and play with me, so I will be getting a copy either way, but I would really prefer a hard copy of this series of games as they hold a special place in my heart.

frxieq,InAbsentiaC,weak/woozy after a Ring Fit workout?,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a 6'1"" male, 39 years old, and approximately 218 pounds. I've been using the Ring Fit for 35 days now (that's game days, not total days; I bought this back in January) and so far I've lost roughly 6-7 pounds. Through the first 30 days or so I felt great, slowly upping the difficulty and slowly losing weight until I hit the maximum difficulty of 30. This was around World 10.

Since that time, I've quickly run out of gas while exercising, to the point where I feel weak, woozy, and sometimes a little nauseous only 10 or 12 minutes into my routine. My routine is heavy on legs and core, with some limited arm and yoga work tossed in. I feel the weakest when I do wide squats, but just 10 or so days ago, I was pumping those out with ease.

I decided I needed a break and chalked it up to not having enough sleep or maybe having allergies (before anyone asks, I have zero symptoms of COVID19, not even symptoms that mimic allergies or whatever; I'm 90% certain I'm not sick). I took the weekend off, made sure I ate right, and tried to get some extra sleep. I also tried to relieve stress by playing other games and reading, giving my body time off all the way around - light walks down my empty street, nothing more than that.

Today, I returned to my routine and the same thing happened again. I felt like crap just 10 minutes into my exercise and had to drop out. It's so damn frustrating.

If I eat some pretzels and have plenty of water, the feeling goes away. I'm eating about an hour before I exercise and I'm drinking a decent amount of water beforehand too... I don't run out of breath so much as my body just crashes and feels like it's weighed down. I lowered the difficulty back down to 28, but I'm thinking I might need to lower it some more? Has anyone else had this experience?

I've been to the doctor in the last 3 months and besides a slightly high cholesterol level and being overweight, there was nothing really wrong with me. My blood sugar, blood pressure, and other vitals were good. 

Any thoughts? Anyone overcome something similar? I'd love to hear feedback.",35,1585596821,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frxieq/weakwoozy_after_a_ring_fit_workout/,NintendoSwitch,1

frwife,CodeChungus,Nintendo's celebration for Mario's 35th anniversary might have a big problem,"As I'm sure many of you are aware Nintendo is rumored to be working on remastered on many remasters of mario games for the switch. If they are indeed remastering mario 64 and mario sunshine then what purpose would Nintendo have to give us N64 and Gamecube NSO support when they can just charge us full price for remasters of those games. . We have been getting drip fed classic games for nearly a year and a half now, and they do not seem to care that fans want at the very least N64 games for the Switch Online service. Why would they? If they can get people to buy a remastered version of mario 64 why should they give us N64 games for $20 a year? In my opinion for the best possible mario anniversary celebration, they should give us the following: N64 games included with the switch online service ( to celebrate mario on top of 20 non mario n64 games it will include the N64 mario party games, mario kart 64, and mario 64), gameboy, gba, and gbc games (this could have 20-30 games including all the mario land games, the mario advance series, and mario kart super circuit), I think having a full NSO library of gamecube games would be a bit far fetched so for now nintendo could just add mario sunshine, all the mario party games, and double dash . This would satisfy everyone waiting for more classic games on the switch, and all the mario fans. This is Nintendo we're talking about though so this probably won't happen. One full $60 remaster I would like to see is galaxy 1-2 in a $60 bundle.",37,1585593758,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frwife/nintendos_celebration_for_marios_35th_anniversary/,NintendoSwitch,1

frvlpc,chingea,Best story-based/cinematic games on switch?,"I’ve recently been considering buying a switch but first I’d like to make sure I would find at least a few good games that I know I will like. I’m not much of a gamer (I’m mostly into film) but I love the idea of video games as a medium for interactive storytelling. For that reason I’m looking for games that are heavily story-based, almost cinematic (if that makes sense), with a great story and cool, innovative gameplay. I’m guessing most of those will be indie games but not necessarily. Some examples to illustrate what I’m talking about: if I had a PS4 I would definitely play Death Stranding or Red Dead Redemption 2 (this is what I meant by cinematic), I enjoy indie games with cool story and inventive gameplay like Her Story or The Stanley Parable, I also just finished Kentucky Route Zero and absolutely loved it! And when I was younger I was a huge fan of Portal, Professor Layton, Ace Attorney and I remember loving a really obscure game called 1112. The only game on Switch so far that I’m excited about is Breath of the Wild but I’m scared of getting bored of it if the story doesn’t keep me going.

Your mileage may vary but I was in greater NYC area. The Costco switch comes with the console, 1 year of subscription to Nintendo online, a 128gb memory card, and a travel case for $350. It’s a great deal as well.

fru44e,SchmittFace,Nintendo Switch FS | Product Concept,"# The Nintendo Switch FS | (Folding Screen)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jl3ujqm84up41.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9f4698cd913e33c7f3e3e2218143a29370d804f

Hi all, having spent a lot of lockdown twiddling my thumbs and staring at walls, thought it'd be fun to try realising a concept I've had on the brain for a while, and I thought I'd share it with y'all!

The Nintendo FS uses a folding display to create new ways to play, namely a revolutionised split-screen function, and the ability to become a whopping 10.2"" display, that can play classic games in native 4:3!

It's a speculative concept, so it's designed for a point in the future where the technology (the flexible OLED, in this case) is more economically viable, my aim is for \~2022.

You can find a lot more on specs etc. and more details on my portfolio!

[https://www.thundow.design/nintendo-switch-fs](https://www.thundow.design/nintendo-switch-fs)

This was a total passion-project for me, and I'm really happy with the outcome!

Thanks for having a look! :D

Parental controls question for you all. How can I prevent random people my child plays with in Splatoon from adding them as a friend. Usually we receive friend requests only from friends at school through friend codes, and don’t want requests from strangers.

2.  Any Existing Zelda remaster or a new one--I'd be down for Windwaker HD on Switch but would also welcome a different remaster (like Skyward Sword)

3.  Fire Emblem Path of Radiance/Radiant Dawn--This one's unlikely but I think giving Ike's games to a larger audience could prove fruitful.

frsqnr,thedustud,Pro Controllers can't survive the washing machine,"TL:DR - I washed my pro controller on accident and it didn't survive the journey. I didn't expect it to live but I wanted to share my story in case someone had any ideas or had similar things happen.

\--------------------

Over the weekend I was cleaning up my room and decided to wash my bed sheets, vacuum and wipe down all the surfaces that we touch constantly. I was going about my business, doing a good job and after an hour I decided to take an Animal Crossing break. The Switch is set up in the bedroom so I went into the room and looked for my Pro Controller. No dice! But fear not, I could just play in handheld mode.

I booted up Animal Crossing and started to play but I got a notification that my pro controller battery was depleted. This wasn't too concerning because of the increase use it's been getting lately due to Animal Crossing. The issue was, once I got into the game, my character started running around all crazy like, menus kept popping up and closing and it was acting super weird. I figured that the pro controller was probably just on it's side somewhere with the buttons accidentally pressed in. I decided to log off and find the controller before something bad could happen.

I searched but couldn't find it until I had the sinking feeling in my stomach... I ran to the washer and opened it. The spin cycle had finished and everything was clean/ready to dry. I pulled out bed sheets, pillow cases and blankets until I heard a ""thud"". . . .

There, at the bottom of the washer was my pro controller, blue light on around the home button. I fished it out and tried to press buttons, hoping to get a response. Nothing. I made sure it was as dry as could be, plugged it in to see if it would charge. Nothing.

I sat with my pro controller, looking at the blue light and waited for it to fade. It was a sad moment. Pro Controller, you will be missed. We had some good times... Breath of the Wild, Hollow Knight, Pokemon. The list goes on and on.

And now I hold onto my Pro Controller. I'm not sure what to do. Bury it in the yard? Cremation? I know it's never coming back but I'm having a hard time letting go. \*chokes back tears\*

Thank you for reading my struggles. Hopefully no one else has to go through this. If someone else finds this post in the future, after their own controller goes through the wash, I have bad news for you.

frsf17,Eyy_Dooga,Clubhouse Games not coming out sooner is a real bummer.,"This is the craziest thing to be upset about, but I can’t shake it for some reason. My wife isn’t thrilled that I have all these games to play during quarantine and I’ve admittedly not spent enough time with her. Clubhouse Games is my dream game, especially since it is something we both would get a ton of enjoyment out of. It’s the Wii Sports successor I’ve been waiting for since launch, and the 40+ board games on top of the classics like bowling, golf, baseball, darts, etc are icing on the cake. 

If there was ever a game that would have been a smash hit as a shadow dropped title, it’s that game. By June we might be on the way out of this mess and this game will still be awesome, but they’re missing out on a big opportunity. I’m sure I’m not the only one in a relationship that saw that trailer and was hoping so hard it was coming out now.

Anyway, not sure how whiny or entitled this comes off, but just wanted to “vent” since I literally have nothing else to do.

frr7oq,BronzeHeart92,I just had an idea for the direction the next mainline Mario game might take...,"Since Mario Odyssey allowed you to dress up Mario in a variety of costumes, a logical evolution would be to make costumes themselves the source of Mario's various powers he's gonna need for the next adventure. While many of these Garbs are naturally inspired by the various power-ups the games had over the years, many new ones can be included as well. Even Mario's iconic ensemble gets the unique function of allowing him passage into 2D sidescrolling segments despite being rather no-frills otherwise.

Nintendo has always loved to experiment and this game would likely be no different from that ideal. Got any questions? Feel free to ask and I'll try to answer them.",4,1585576481,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frr7oq/i_just_had_an_idea_for_the_direction_the_next/,NintendoSwitch,1

frpoyh,BJJStrong,"Why isn't it a bigger deal that ACNH, a game meant to be played over weeks/months/years doesn't have save transfer/cloud back up in 2020?","I love Animal Crossing, it's been my favorite franchise since I picked up the Gamecube version as a kid. I've already invested over 20 hours hours ( a lot for me) and think New Horizons is excellent. 

However I can't get over what is a very fundamental problem with the game that IMO should be a bigger talking point by reviewers and fans. For a game like AC that is meant to be played over long spans of time, and progress is often limited by the number of physical days you play, its absolutely insane to me that there is no save transfer or cloud save.

It's 2020, some sort of backup save option has been standard in gaming for decades. Yet for Nintendo, one of the largest gaming companies in the world, to not have it for THE game where it is most necessary is outrageous.

The reality of technology is that things can go wrong, whether its wear and tear, fundamental design flaws (red ring of death in Xbox 360 or joycon drift issues for example) or freak accidents. Everytime I pick up ACNH I can't help thinking that all of my progress can be lost in a second because of some issue I have no control over, and there's nothing I can do to get back that time I put into my island because of Nintendo's stubbornness and bad decision making. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure most people will be fine. But the fact that we have no option to protect our progress and basically have to cross our fingers that our Switch lasts another 4+ years until the next AC is mind boggling when this issue has been easily solved for decades.",23,1585570473,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frpoyh/why_isnt_it_a_bigger_deal_that_acnh_a_game_meant/,NintendoSwitch,1

frpbtm,theoriginaltsundoku,I want to get a second switch so my mom can play ACNH with me (two SEPARATE games/islands); is this a problem?,"So my mom recently got me a Switch and ACNH to help me deal with my chronic pain. Long story short, it works wonders and keeps my mind occupied from the pain like nothing else. My mother also has chronic pain so I would like to get her a Switch so she can play with me. But I don’t want to play couch co-op, I specifically want us to each have our own ACNH island and to use online play to visit and trade with each other. 

My questions are:
- If I buy her another switch with a separate physical copy of whatever game I want us to play, would I be able to have her signed in to my Nintendo account so that she can use my online play plan at the same time that I am using it on the first switch, OR do we have to get her own account and pay for a whole other online play plan for this situation to work? Or is that what the family plan is for?

Knowledgeable answers are greatly appreciated as this is something I would love to do for her because I believe it would help her in dealing with her own pain. I’m not looking for any crazy workarounds to cheat the system, I don’t wanna deal with that hassle. I just want to know if the way I’m asking will work, and if not then to be enlightened on the best way for us to play together.

I was hoping to get your advice, my girlfriend and I are both keyworkers (i work in child protection and she works in mental health rehabilitation) so things are a little stressful at home right now. My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and this situation has really exacerbated this over the last few weeks. One of the days she usually calms down, like many of us, is to find a game she can get sucked into. 

My girlfriend is a huge nintendo fan and grew up playing mysims and harry potter on the nintendo ds and gameboy. Even when discussing her beloved nintendo systems a smile returns to her face with all the nostalgic memories she has of playing with her older sister.

 I came up with the idea of surprising her with a nintendo switch with animal crossing and have been hunting everywhere. However, it seems that everywhere in the UK is out of stock and i am no closer to getting her this surprise.

I was wondering if anyone of this subreddit knew about when stock is expected in the UK? Or anywhere which does have stock? It would be amazing to have an idea so that i could plan a surprise for her. I appreciate any advice and hope everyone is finding comfort from their video games at this tricky time!",15,1585565126,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/froiha/can_anyone_advise_where_i_can_get_my_keyworker/,NintendoSwitch,1

frnx7x,rednu23,One Step From Eden is incredible yet riddled with incredibly bad design too,"Wanted to do a little write-up on my thoughts on One Step From Eden, a simultaneous release on the Nintendo Switch and PC. I wanted give my thoughts and opinion on the game for anyone on the fence and wondering what the game is like.

**What is One Step From Eden?**

One-line summary: One Step From Eden is a rogue-like mash-up between Megaman Battle Network and Slay the Spire. 

You are thrown in a fight against one or two relatively simple enemies to start, with a loadout of spells, passives, and basic attack command that is unique to your character/config. With each victory you are awarded money and opportunities to acquire more passives and active commands that are thrown in your deck which you draw from and utilize in battle. And when you die? You lose everything, it's not an RPG, it's a constant uphill battle challenging you to survive for as long as you can. It is a nerve-wracking crazy onslaught of fast-paced battles mixed in with clever and thoughtful deck-building mechanics.

**On the one hand...**

This game is amazing. It requires so much from you, there is almost always something else you could have been doing to play optimally, and when you feel like you're doing 4 or 5 things right all at once, it really makes you feel like a bad ass. You can be hopping from one square to the next like the platforms are on fire, holding down your right trigger to spam Saffron's mega buster, whilst slinging spells as soon as you get the mana for them at the enemy. All the while, you're trying to attack accurately, but also you're reacting to their attacks and trying to nimbly dodge out of the way. The fun thing about this game is this crazy juggling act that throws you in a trance. You're focused and doing all you can to beat the opponent in front of you, and if you're doing at least half of those things correctly, you're going to feel really good about yourself. But this is only the *micro* side of things.

The *macro* of the game, the managing of your spells, choosing what is the fat you need to trim and what family of spells you want to see more often to build your deck towards is also really gratifying. Eventually you get to the point of proudly seeing your ""Flow"" deck come together. You pat yourself on the back because you could have taken that one Flow spell that cost 3 mana, but you smartly realized your main win-condition is to spam Rock Juggle and not just mindlessly add every card that gives Flow into your deck. Then there's the Shopkeeper who you see offers a slew of different passives and spells and.. wait, pacts? What are those? It's always been right in front of you but you never paid attention to them until now that you've had a few seconds for your mind to breathe. All of a sudden a deal with the devil presents itself to you. You can take this pact, which grants 25 Money to buy that one artifact that just completes your deck; but in exchange, that pact will force you to deal with random swords falling on your side of the battlefield for the next 3 battles! You're at half HP with the floor boss just around the corner. Do you do it?

This game presents to you so many interesting decisions on both micro and macro levels. But what did it take to actually get to this point?

**Good luck learning all this yourself**

One Step From Eden does nothing to show you the ropes of the game outside for a handful of tutorials that teach you how to use spells and basic attacks. You're taught how to do most of these things, but very little effort is spared teaching you which of these things are important and what you should be doing. Should you be taking every spell in the game at every opportunity? If you're familiar at all with deck-building games, the answer is usually no.

This game teaches you how to paddle and throws you in a whirlpool. For example, one tutorial show you how to set your Focus, but it doesn't teach you what to set your Focus on. What selecting your Focus allows you to do is to see spells from certain families of spells more often. The challenging problem? There is a selection of **more than 10 families of spells**, of which TWO you are able to set as your foci. This helps you with deck-building but then again, what kind of spells are in these families? Would you know if you are building a Flow deck that not all Flow spells are in the Hearth family but some are in Kinesys? Or that arguably the best Flow payoff spell, Waterfall, is in neither of those families but in Doublelift?? Not without a lot of experience and familiarity, that's for sure.

But what I just described above is fairly involved and probably would not be able to explain itself well in a tutorial anyway. So what about something more basic? How about whenever you defeat a floor boss, you start to notice that they are kneeling on the ground with 1 HP? You've never noticed this just now but why do they do that? Just to throw out a dramatic line? No, in fact, if you decide to NOT finish the floor boss off with a death blow and instead move on, they will repay your gratitude by healing you for 400 and on occasion, help you during fights! This is indispensable when you are low on health or especially when up against a tough boss they come out of nowhere to revive you. Or how about on the flip side? For the more merciful folk, did you know that if you did decide to kill the boss that you are pretty much guaranteed an Upgrade or Remove artifact?

Even with all my hours in the game, I still don't know everything. For instance, the characteristics of the different stages? I so far can only guess that the Magma stage is unique in that it probably has the evil Shopkeeper who barters with your health and not your money. There is so much to learn but unfortunately for the overwhelming majority of it, you're on your own in learning it.

**There is too much going on**

How many things are there to do really? You can manage movement, unleash your spells, hold down your RT for infinite mega buster,, weigh the options of which enemy is a priority to handle, place your spells accurately on your targets, actively anticipate and dodge the attack patterns of your enemies... and on top of all that? You can take a look at which spells are coming up next, constantly ask yourself whether it is worth it to cycle your remaining mana to get to the spell sitting third from the bottom of your deck, OR you can decide to leave yourself spell-less a few seconds and shuffle your deck and hand. *Are* you going to do all these things at once? Probably not! 

I mentioned it above but while this juggling act throws you in a satisfying trance, it also is just really easy to forget a handful of these things. The core gameplay is the real-time battles, and it is nothing like Slay the Spire where you have an infinite amount of time to determine what the best move is. You have to react on the fly and do what is best to deal with the enemy as fast as possible, and if you're not, then good luck progressing.

**This game is unrelenting and unapologetic**

So what is progression in this game anyway? One Step From Eden dangles a lip-smacking total of **NINE** different characters you are able to choose from for each run. But wait, how can you choose them? Well, you can't choose all of them to start, you have to unlock them. How do you unlock them you ask? Without a quick Google search, I can tell you a majority of the people who bought this game will likely not find out.

Why? The only way you can unlock characters in this game (save for one) is by beating them as they appear as a floor boss from the fourth floor on.

This is insanely hard to do for the average player. Not only does this task require a lot of time and attention to learning the different bosses/enemies and their attacks, as well the numerous little micro/macro mechanics in the game-- but it demands you execute your knowledge on these things near flawlessly. You **need** to know that the Bard boss (I think her name is Violette) requires you to dance onto the tiles she plays music on so you can get the Shield you need to withstand her unavoidable follow-up attack. Each floor ramps up the difficulty of the floor boss an incredulous amount. Shiso as a first floor boss is a chump to if you happen to run into him on the fourth floor where he is shoving a hundred Jam spells in your deck, rendering it near useless. You **need** to have a good deck plan and get the right pieces to make a good pattern of attack against the boss.

After my 100th or so time dying I scratched my head when I realized that a full successful run of the game is **completing eight floors**. How on earth am I going to do that?

Not only is it very difficult, the game allows you to make some pretty poor decisions. For instance, most people would not notice there's a skip button when asked to choose an Artifact or spell to add to their deck. They may only see the choices of cards in front of them, when likely a very good decision is to choose none of them. 

Another example is Wristwatch, which is Chrono-Saffron's basic weapon attack that replaces her Default variant's mega buster. Wristwatch slows time for 2 seconds instead of lodging buster shots into enemy skulls. The difference with Wristwatch and the mega buster is not only the fact that it deals absolutely no damage, but the fact that Wristwatch costs 1 mana. Because of this you can get caught in many situations where you Wristwatch so you can land a powerful spell on the enemy, only to realize the mana you spent casting Wristwatch was the mana you needed for that powerful spell, and that you can't cast it until Wristwatch's duration is over, effectively rendering your usage of Wristwatch pretty useless. 

**But now that I'm here I can't go back**

Despite all this being said, I cannot say I want One Step From Eden to be more forgiving. This game is unapologetic and icy cold in its demeanor, but I'm loving it so far. It's so fun and challenging, I feel like it'd be such a shame for it to be toned down. I've so far unlocked two characters and I crave for the opportunity to earn more.  They are so different from Saffron (who you start out with) and present new playstyles and surprisingly, entirely different *perspectives* on what is good and what is bad in certain situations. I feel like One Step From Eden is a home run in so many aspects, but it has so many glaring problems. It refuses to teach you how to play it well and presents an unforgiving difficulty, making it an especially hard nut to crack into. But once you crack it, or at least once you feel like you are, the reward is very satisfying.",27,1585562086,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frnx7x/one_step_from_eden_is_incredible_yet_riddled_with/,NintendoSwitch,1

frniym,solisb,Animal crossing save data corrupted,"So I bought New Horizons today in my brother’s Switch. Play for like 2 hours, then saved and turned it off. About an hour ago my brother went on to play it and I wanted to see how he was going, and he explains that there was a corruption in the game and so he’s deleted it and is redownloading it to play it. He also said that this happens all the time with other games because his Switch is corrupted - something I didn’t know. 

Apparently this all started when he downloaded something called Duck Game, and when a corruption appears in a game he just redownloads it and it’s all fine. Though I recall seeing in the fine print for New Horizons that the data might not be recovered?

Anyone had experience like this? If the save data stays I guess it’s fine, but if there’s something wrong with the console that prevents me from playing it I might just request a refund.

frmk94,Shinobihost,BOTW2 likely not coming in 2020,"Two different insiders posted about it today. 

First it was Nate which was quoting a tweet from the youtuber Arlo with his prediction about BOTW being on this year

&gt; Breath of the Wild 2 for 2020 is nothing more than fan expectation. There's been no indication it'll come this year via official communication.

&gt; Factor in current events &amp; the odds for 2020 dwindle. I'd go as far to say that I'm 98.76% sure it will not release this holiday.

https://twitter.com/DirectFeedGames/status/1244477584139857927

And then a few minutes after that, another insider and ex-gameinformer Inram said:

&gt; Even in the best case scenario, BOTW2 this year was a moonshot.

&gt; With people no longer in the offices, things move slower.

Which honestly, even if rumors, I don't doubt at all that we'll see tons of things delayed internally which means, unannounced games and announced games as well. With the other rumor from the Gamesbeat guy about this year being heavily about remasters/remakes and the fact that we have rumors about Metroid Prime Trilogy, 3D World and Pikmin 3 already done but on the shelf for times when they're needed, I guess this is going to be like this. 

Unfortunately 2020 will be like this in general, I guess, and with Nintendo it won't be different.",7,1585554447,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frmk94/botw2_likely_not_coming_in_2020/,NintendoSwitch,1

frlzmp,NikkoBer04,Are full shell replacements possible and have they been documented? I would love a video.,"Probably best asked in daily question thread but it’ll be gone in 4 hours and I need to sleep. 

My nintendo switch’s shell shows damage and age from dropping it so much (blame my little brother, not me lol). The most notable damage is the plastic fan vent is missing, leaving the internals exposed to the elements. The screw (by the vent) that holds the the shells together is missing that loop where the screw sits in and requires tape to hold it together now. Instead of buying a completely new switch, I was thinking why not just replace the shell all together? Is this possible and has it been documented before? 

(Also this is completely unrelated but my right joycon rail broke so i attempted my first repair on the switch itself and i couldn’t get the last two screws that held the right rail in place as they stripped, so I replaced the thermal paste on the copper heat sink and closed it back up. Works like a charm still but my rail doesn’t work and I’d love to just chop that shit out along with the shell.)",4,1585551307,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frlzmp/are_full_shell_replacements_possible_and_have/,NintendoSwitch,1

frlsjf,Gas-O-Wine,Cant find the REAL temperatures of the switch,"Months ago a saw a couple of video of a youtuber that made nice stuff to analyze the temperatures of the switch handheld and docked (plus also a tovel on it?) 
It noticed temps like 42 c° for breath of the aild handheld and 47 c° for fast rmx maybe?
Docked was higher clearly. Around 50 if I remenber correctly. 
I have on of those cheap laser gun to take temps by distance, not that accurate but after multiple times you may know more or less which temp is the right one.
Putting in on the display, right corner, it reaches 37-40 c°, as expectes, then, pointing it directly, inside, in the fans spot on the top site, the tempo gets higher and higher (handheld) also 47.
While docked, doing the same latest thing, on games that make the switch work hard (my case, tt isle of man) damn I got 63.
The more I stay poiting inside, the more the tempo raises (and stops after some).
Isnt it worrying? I played with hard fans like that for seveeal hours with fire emblem three houses docked, it never shut off. But some said that the temp of shutting down due overheating is around 69 c°. Pretty close!!!
The switch I got is the first version, use just a little, bought used by me, since october no issues of any kind.
I would just to know how the things really are. Are we always so close to the safety shut down? Or peoole making the videos do not consider the inner temp?

frlczq,Hurk7288,Question regarding possible switch lite drifting + pro controller,"Before I start I don't own any switch or any console at all and am asking this because in the near future I'm planning to get a lite (ironic since they're all sold out). 

I have read a lot about the drift issue on the switch and the switch lite and clearly it's a very common issue among the community assuming it isn't overblown, so to be prepared I want to know about using the pro controller to solve the drift if I do get it. If I buy a controller and connect it to the switch lite, which has unremovable joysticks, and tried to use the controller to erase the joystick drift on the main body of the lite will it get rid of the input on the actual switch?

As an example, if I have my left joystick on my switch lite get a drifting problem can I connect a pro controller and play drift free? After searching on the internet I seem to get mixed answers, some say it still takes the input from the main joysticks and some say it blocks the joysticks and would like someone with a lite to at least try it out.

I apologize if this is a dumb question, I just really like to be prepared for situations like these when buying anything. And I'm aware that I can get the drift problem fixed for free, but from reading other experiences that seems to take a while and often times it breaks again within days or weeks.

For those who don't have time to read my unnecessarily long question: if I connect a pro controller to a switch lite with drift issues, will the ""drift input"" be blocked by the ""non drift input"" of the pro controller?",1,1585548070,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frlczq/question_regarding_possible_switch_lite_drifting/,NintendoSwitch,1

My girlfriend and I have  been having a stellar time playing New Horizons on switch. We're  actually in talks of getting her a switch lite once this whole  coronavirus thing is over because.. we can't find one but overall.. I  feel like the game is waaaaay slower then previous titles. I feel like  the stuff I want to get to is time-gated more then before.

I  love the new islands, I love the classic game-play but I don't like the  feeling that it's taking me over a week to feel like I'm making  progress. Every step of ""Building your island"" is time-gated right out  the gate and I hate that feeling. I play World of Warcraft and they have  ""Daily quests"" which is rinse, wash and repeat EVERY DAY which gets  boring after awhile.. I can't help but get this feeling that this game  will eventually do that.

I'm also  getting kinda burnt out on Nook Miles Progression. It's a lot of the  same ""Rinse, Wash, Repeat"" type stuff but maybe I'm feeling it right now  because there aren't a lot of fish/bugs to catch but I have hope that  the game will pick up.

frk9c0,dragonfirez9,How to fix joy con drift,"its not 100% success rate because some joy con drift is software, not grime buildup in your joy con

Alright, props to nintendo for their work on the switch, but the fact that we still have joy-con drift is kinda stupid.

And if you have it and tried to diy fix it, you probably noticed the videos saying ""buy a new joystick and insert it"" and people opening up their joycons

Or that one dude with a can of compressed air

Well if you are broke like me, you probably want a way to fix it without buying something to fix it.

What if i told you you could fix it for about 0$ and no fear of messing anything up? oh, it also takes about 2 minutes.

**HOW TO DO IT**

If you are to tilt the joystick to one side, you will see a big sphere(the one that makes the stick work) and also a thin sheet of rubber, a lighter gray in color, that is blanketing the sphere.

First thing you need is a straw. Take one end and flatten the end so that it resembles a line.

slide the stick to one side and insert the flat end of the straw under the plastic sheet. It may take a little bit, but it should slide in. Don't go super saiyan and start jabbing it in. Be careful.

Once its **under** the thin rubber layer, but the straw back in your mouth and start blowing

It should start to clear the dust buildup under the rubber cap

You can then circle the straw around the stick, eliminating dust from each angle

Do this for a while, then calibrate it back to factory settings.

And your joy con drift should be fixed!

Unless its a software bug, and try not to get saliva on the inside.

If it starts drifting again, just rinse and repeat. It lasts wayyyyy longer than calibrating would",1,1585542683,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frk9c0/how_to_fix_joy_con_drift/,NintendoSwitch,1

It’s either a black screen or the small coconut tree loading icon in the bottom right corner. 

I uninstalled and reinstalled it, updated etc. After reinstalling for the first time it worked fine, but if I close the game or the switch and try to load it up again the same problem happens. 

Is the game card just faulty or is there a way to fix it myself?",2,1585542057,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frk4jk/new_horizons_black_screen_after_turning_off_switch/,NintendoSwitch,1

I almost always play in docked mode and I am not worried about knocking over my switch, so I wanted to ask if I am better off letting it live, converting it to a portable one for more airflow (and which one would be recommended), or slapping a fan on the original dock (and which one would be recommended).

frjgmz,Shinobihost,Animal Crossing New Horizons is my first game on the series and I've been loving it,"Okay, it's not exactly my first game on the series as I have played for a few hours Wild World on the DS when I was younger, but at the time I didn't like it at all and I didn't play much. 

I always wanted to play Animal Crossing and even like it after that as the characters seemed really charismatic and the idea looked really novel to me. This interest also made me read a lot about the series and its development as well over the years. 

I thought to buy New Leaf for years but never did for some reason, until the entry for Switch was announced. But even seeing everything about it and how it was, and while wanting it, I've decided to not buy it with the fear to not like it again. But then I saw the tons of positive reviews and after reading them, I gave the chance and well, I've been loving the game so far. 

It's a perfect game to play on few hours or even go beyond it. I've been playing some days just one or two hours and in other going way beyond that. It's not like any of game I played. I'm doing ""nothing"" but none of that makes me feel bored, which I feel much comes from Nook Miles as I get new things to buy every time I do things on the world so I always have motivation to be doing things.

Anyway, just wanted to share this experience as this is the game that made me a fan of the series and I'm happy I gave the series a chance as it was probably the perfect game for me to enter into the franchise.",17,1585539108,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frjgmz/animal_crossing_new_horizons_is_my_first_game_on/,NintendoSwitch,1

It all sounds very nice, and the game itself looks pretty interesting, but I always hear the point brought up that the most fun part is being able to visit friends and groups. Is the game still just as good if you don't do that? The overwhelmingly positive reception of NH makes me very interested, but I do not have any friends or groups that I could experience the social part with. I am and have been very unsuccessful at socializing and meeting new people, so it would not be possible to make new friends for this purpose.

frj0yf,xsam99,Is it weird that I’m this picky about my game library? Any suggestions?,"So I’ve had a Switch since launch and went a little crazy when I first bought it. I have this thing about me that wants to see a nice complete library. 

At first, I was buying all the games I wanted to play but at this point there are actually quite a lot I’d like to play, even if once. 
However, I realized I would be going down a dangerous rabbit hole as I felt guilty about buying $10-$60 games that I’d play once or just a few times.

So I deleted all my games except the ones I thought were the premium (ideally Nintendo published), nearly infinite replay-value, must have games for the Nintendo switch and also I wiped my play time data except those chosen games so my profile looked cleaner. 

And this leaves me with just 7 games:

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - the most popular game in my house, we play this almost every night

Super Mario Odyssey - my favorite 3D Mario game after 64. I have replayed this 4 times already. A genuine classic. 

Super Mario Maker 2 - when I’m in the mood for some 2D Mario, also basically infinite play value

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - duh

Splatoon 2 - my online game of choice, never have problems finding a quick match and no lag compared to smash

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - I mean, do I have to explain this one, I also play this one online

Animal Crossing: New Horizons - New Leaf has the most hours clocked on my 3DS (almost 2000), this was a no-brainer. 


If you’ve noticed a trend about these select games, they’re all titles that are almost obviously must-have titles and and might even look like the chosen games you might see on an image of a switch home screen for promotional material. They all have excellent replay-value (or play value in the case of BotW and AC:NH) and all have this particular charm and quality assurance that comes with being Published by Nintendo. 

What other games do you think might fit into my library? I seriously regret choices like Luigi’s Mansion 3, Mario &amp; Rabbids, and Pokémon as they were all beaten quite quickly with very little incentive to revisit. I really thought Pokémon would fit into my permanent list of games but the national dex thing and selling the rest of the Pokédex as DLC is just something I don’t agree with and so I have stopped playing it. 

Sorry for wall of text, thanks for your help.",25,1585537266,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frj0yf/is_it_weird_that_im_this_picky_about_my_game/,NintendoSwitch,1

Me and my girlfriend are currently doing the ""Switch Game Sharing"" method where we both have each others accounts as primaries on our different switches.

I've recently just bought an online copy of the new Animal crossing game, but for some reason she's unable to buy a copy for herself as I guess her switch is detecting that I own the game?

How would we go about having her be able to purchase the game for herself digitally? Would we have to remove my account as the primary from her system so she could then purchase the game herself?

I live alone, and the lockdown here in the UK looks like it's going to go on for a while so past week I decided to have a gander at the eShop and bought Grim Fandango, Ori &amp; The Blind Forest, Final Fantasy 7 and Link's Awakening.

I beat Grim Fandango pretty quickly as I'd already played it in the 90s and remembered a surprising amount of stuff from it. I'm finding the same is true of Link's Awakening but it looks so good and feels very modern so it's a very different experience than it was on the Game Boy, plus I've never done the Colour Dungeon. They've been fun nostalgia trips. I'm about halfway through Link's Awakening but I decided to take a break from it and started Ori &amp; The Blind Forest today. I've put about 4.5 hours into it and it's a lot of fun to play. I'm loving the art style and the music too.

I haven't started FF7 yet, I didn't play it fully as a kid as I never had a Playstation so I'm looking forward to getting into it. The lockdown has two weeks to go at the very least and probably a lot longer, so I might need to buy a few more games as well. I've got my eyes on Super Mario Odyssey, Astral Chain and Cuphead. I wish I could get Ring Fit Adventure as well but that seems practically impossible at the best of times!",11,1585519409,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/freair/im_so_glad_i_bought_a_switch_right_now/,NintendoSwitch,4

frdy0g,furretguy,Sometimes Animal Crossing helps me get up every morning.,"I suffer from depression. The week that ACNH came out I went to the doctors over it, got screamed at by my parents for going then cried for half a morning at school. Honestly not ideal but I thought ""Well I've got ACNH to look forward to I've got to make it until Friday"". 

Sometimes I really can't be bothered to get up. I don't see any sort of reason why I should get up. Not worth anything. Nope.

Since I've bought ACNH I've been thinking ""Well if I don't get up, Antonio might leave if I don't talk to him"" or ""I've got to catch some fish today, if I sell 100,000 bells worth I'll be able to expand my house or build a new bridge"". 

It's made me feel like I've got some sort of purpose on that deserted island. That I'm the one shaping it to be more habitable (if that's a word). 

It's one of those games that picks me up every morning. It doesn't hook me like Zelda BOTW where I can play for hours at a time, and that's a good thing as I want it to be a pick up game in the morning with longer play sessions after I've finished work for the day.

I hope I can keep up with playing it. All of the villagers are so nice. I've got Antonio, Tangy, Benjamin, Flurry and I'm trying to get rid of Rocket (No offence I'm just not a fan). Getting this new bird/eagle villager in  tomorrow which I am super looking forward to. 

It's sort of silly, but the customisation is also really good for me. I'm not a huge fan of myself and got dead low confidence. Making myself in Animal Crossing is sort of like making me feel better about myself as villagers in game never say anything nasty about me (Unless I get stung by wasps). It's just so nice.

I'm sort of not super duper into it just yet, sometimes I go on, wander around, then go off. I guess that's the point of it? Maybe? I know the game isn't for everyone. But I have been playing every day for atleast an hour or two. 

I hope that if you're struggling that you find a game that works for you. ACNH isn't for everyone, I'm not expecting this game to fix my problems but it's helping them out during this tough time. Finding a game that makes you want to return to it every day is the best feeling.",112,1585518172,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frdy0g/sometimes_animal_crossing_helps_me_get_up_every/,NintendoSwitch,12

frdjpy,Oravital1,Regions question,"I’m planing to get one of the switch bundles and it comes with a game code (I think it’s Mario kart). I’m not currently living in the US so I guess the code will only be useable in the eshop of the country I’m currently in. Problem is I want my main profile to be in the us region (the games are cheaper).

So how are these region thing will work? Am I gonna need to create an account with the country I’m currently in, download the game, and then switch my account to the US? Or will I just be able to create a US account and download the game from there (idk of the codes are universal)?

I also heard the switch has region free games, although I’m not sure what that means.

One more question: how are the funds for my account work? For example I have a US PSN account but my credit cards aren’t American (I don’t live in the US), so whenever I want to download a game from the PSN store I just buy a PSN card and then use those funds to download the game. Is this the same case here?

I never had a Nintendo device so I’m not familiar with how Nintendo do their online stuff. If you could maybe use examples from PSN that’ll be useful as I understand how PSN work really well.",9,1585516764,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frdjpy/regions_question/,NintendoSwitch,0

I like Animal Crossing because honestly, I just like the cuteness of the game lmao. Everyone says it’s really fun and relaxing to play as well. 

Zelda on the other hand is also an option b/c  of the amount of playing hours it has. It also has an actual “storyline” compared to AC. I know AC has an objective, but in terms of a typical storyline, Zelda has more of that I think based off of what I’ve watched/read online. The cuteness factor is definitely in this one as silly as it sounds. 

Price is the same for each ($50) so that’s not a problem.

frcp8a,NintendoSwitchMods,/r/NintendoSwitch Mod Applications Now Open,"Greetings!

It's time once again for us to open up our doors and start taking applications for some fresh new moderators to join our ranks.

Over the past year (ish), we've had some moderators who have gone inactive, experienced significant life changes (such as moving, new jobs, and babies), or fell into the rabbit hole of Animal Crossing: New Horizons and haven't been seen since. This reduction in active moderators has left the remaining mod team fighting an uphill battle for quite some time now, and it's time we brought in some reinforcements.

We've tasked our trusty /u/NintendoSwitchBot with monitoring how many items are in the mod queue at any given time in order to precisely determine what hours of the day need the most support. In the past, we'd just made educated guesses, which worked *okay*, but we want to be a little more precise this time around.

We'll keep applications open for approximately **one week** before closing things down. It will probably take us an additional week after that to narrow it down to some finalists and reach out with any further questions we may have before making our final selections.

**[To submit your application, please fill out this Google Form.](https://forms.gle/wf4AZCozkk22onqb6)**

*(Note: The application is long and will take quite some time to complete.)*

frc770,nswmodsaredogs,The situation of buying a Switch is so sa...,"I'm just looking around to see if people selling any games but all I see is Nintendo Switch at $400, some have multiple of them stack on top of each other.

This reminds me of the graphic cards price when crypto currency was at its prime. But at that time we didnt have this Chinese Virus going around killing and locking people at home. So buying a GPU wasnt a necessary. But now I see people want to buy Switch to stay inside and play their game to pass time but they cant find none. The scalpers bought them all.

This week I just upgraded my PC and I got all the parts from Microcenter without s problem, normal price, but people looking to buy a Switch arent that lucky.

frb8i6,cartoon200,Total noob needs help before buying Switch Lite,"Hello guys!
I've been a gamer for almost 25 years but never owned any Nintendo console. 
I fell in love with Switch but it was a little too expensive for me. Now there's Switch Lite and I'm having a hard time resisting buying it. 
After a little research, I found out that version of games for Switch are much more expensive than for the PS4 or PC. 
Now, I made a shortlist of about 10 games I would like to buy, but prices vary up to 100% from shop to shop (digital versions).
As I'm familiar with how things are working for PS4 and Steam, I would like to ask you guys to help me understand is it the same for the Nintendo.
For both Steam and PS4 I create an account and it doesn't matter if I buy things from the official shop, Amazon or some other shop, I only need to provide the code and I get the game. Is it the same for Nintendo? 
I'm pretty convinced to buy a console but I'm pretty pessimistic about the price of games, so please help me with the dilemma. From what I know for now, 5-10 games could double or triple the investment and that's a little bit discouraging at the moment.",8,1585508761,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/frb8i6/total_noob_needs_help_before_buying_switch_lite/,NintendoSwitch,1

fravbj,Stay-Toasty,"After not owning a Nintendo console in about 10-15 years and only playing on Playstation, I picked up a Switch and it amazed me. Especially the QoL features.","The last Nintendo I had was the N64 and I absolutely loved it. Besides Metal Gear Solid 4, Majoras Mask and OoT are my favorite games of all time.
  Last night I watched one of those stupid 10 things you didn't know about your Switch and it amazed me.

  - One of them being the fact that if you can't find one of the Joy-Cons, you can hold a button to make the missing one continuously vibrate to help find it.
-
 -If you have a PS4 and PSVR you can totally hook it up and have the Switch video go through the VR headset. It may work with other headsets, Im not sure, but I wouldnt be surprised.

  -You can charge your phone with the Switch undocked.

- You can pair the Joy-con with an Android phone to play games on your phone with the Switch controller.

 - You can switch regions at any time you want.
You can even get a vertical adapter to play certain games more comfortably.
      A lot of you probably knew most of this, but itbreally amazed me how many quality of life features Nintendo implemented into the Switch after not playing in a Nintendo system for so long. 
I'm loving my time with this system and being able to play some of the great franchises I've missed out on for so many years. 
If you have any good Switch game recommendations that arent obvious ones, please let me know. Digital or Cartridge.

fr9ylr,huehueville,"For Animal Crossing, I underestimated the amount of stuff I can do in-game","Before I bought the game, people on this Subreddit were telling me that it's a play-30-mins a day game, and I was actually a bit sad that the game would have so little to offer.

Little did I know that I have become addicted to the game, and the sheer amount of stuff available to do every day has become almost overwhelming. Of course, I can choose not to do some of the tasks, but it's really tempting to do everything.

I won't spoil what type of content they have to offer, but the game definitely opens up more after 3 or more days, and you can start do a lot more things. And the basic stuff, like fishing/flower planting tasks, can be pretty time consuming. I spent hours yesterday trying to find a fish, and it was really stressful, actually.

I think people who play animal crossing find creative outlets for whatever they like to do in the game - and there is just so much to do. I actually like the fishing tasks a lot less now because how hard it is to catch rare fish - but it's so easy to obsess over collecting and designing things.

I have looked at r/AnimalCrossing and a few other subs, and people are way ahead of me interms of game progression. I've been playing the game non-stop for a week now, and I'm still pretty behind these guys.

fr98yw,samoyedpoopies,[Question] I started ACNH on my roommate’s Switch. How do I transfer the game data to my own when it arrives?,"Hi Everyone,

I bought Animal Crossing when it came out, and I have been playing it every day on my roommate’s Switch with the intention of getting the coral Switch lite when it came out on April 3rd. I specifically bought the physical copy of the game since I figured I could just put the game in my own console when it came, however I just learned that the game data is saved locally on the console &amp; not the physical game card itself (it has been a while since I have played video games, so I figured the data still saved on the actual game card). So, my question is this: am I able to transfer my game data to my new switch, and also to a new Nintendo account, or am I doomed to start the entire game over and lose tens of hours of gameplay? I tried to google the situation, but it seemed like you needed to use the same account as well, and I’d be using my own account on my own Switch. Any and all help would be appreciated, even if it’s to tell me that I’m doomed and need to start everything over!

I've had mine since launch day and he's getting into video games a lot more lately so I wanted him to have his own, for not wholly unselfish reasons. Anyways, I have purchased quite a few titles digitally, especially recently due to the lockdown. Most recently Animal Crossing. I have my account set up on his switch but he also has his own profile. However, I purchase all the games under my own profile. As it stands, in order to play any digital games on his Switch he needs to be logged into my profile. Furthermore, if I log into my switch, no matter which digital game I intend to play, he gets kicked out.

Somehow, when I was wearing extra fuzzy pants and after I just put on a hoodie, I built up enough shock that when I touched my Switch Pro controller, it remapped all the buttons. Pressing minus acts like plus and now plus doesn't do anything. The L button now likes to take screenshots and the D-pad now goes to the end of a list and not one-by-one like it should. R brings up the sleep menu in-game when it shouldn't. I can now only use my Joy-Cons, but my Switch Pro controller that I like using the most won't work. I've tried connecting my controller to Steam and remapping buttons there and also letting the controller run out of charge, but to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Has this even happened to anyone else before? Are there any other solutions I could try? Is my controller just broken now? I greatly appreciate any help.

Maybe my tastes have changed or maybe the tiny text, extremely zoomed out views, and blur on both fore and backgrounds is just making this feel very unattractive to play handheld. 

It also seems a lot more generic than I remember. Maybe it's just timing, I'll give it another go soon but just wanted to see if I was alone in thinking this didn't quite feel right or if I just haven't given it a proper chance.

I had tried to buy several that came in stock on Amazon, but every time I tried to add it to my cart it was already gone. I ended up catching one from Walmart, and it was still available even after I entered in my payment/shipping info.

My guess is that Scalpers are mostly buying from Amazon, so Walmart's stock actually lasts long enough to react. I've seen other people say they've gotten theirs from Best Buy, so I assume the same case applies.

fr80v7,BiggerInTheInside,Do NOT buy Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,"This game is a mess!

Graphics: the graphics did not age well at all. I'll leave it at that.

Gameplay: very clunky gameplay and controls. Even with gyro controls on, it is extremely difficult to hit someone with a blaster. Lightsaber combat feels very cumbersome and imprecise. 

Sound: blaster noises and star wars ost are the only good things about this game. Voice acting is okay.

Multiplayer: this game should have shipped with multiplayer. It is flat out broken. Most of the time, my game freezes when searching for a match. If you're lucky enough to enter a match, the experience just gets worse. There is no way of knowing what you're supposed to be doing when playing objective game modes. Spawn killing is abundant. The map spawning system is confusing. It is very confusing on how to find the score in objective based game modes.

Other: many graphical glitches. Many times when I die, my character just spreads all his arms and legs apart, lies on the floor, and floats. 



TLDR: This game is a broken waste of money. Unless they add some type of aim assist, fix multiplayer and the bugs, it's  not worth anyone's time.

I still have an account on that switch, and I still have a residence on that island. Will my residence there be the same as an npcs when I visit, or will I have access to my stuff there? Or will both switches explode?",1,1585495189,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr7gd8/does_anyone_know_how_animal_crossing_will_handle/,NintendoSwitch,1

fr7b92,TrunksSSJ,I developed a social media platform dedicated to Animal Crossing,"Since the recent release of the newest installment and during this pandemic, I have decided to create an online social media platform for all the Animal Crossing fans out there; [Animal Crossing Lounge](https://ac-lounge.ch/)

# What is this platform good for?

You can do the following on this platform:

* Posts content about Animal Crossing in general
* Edit your profile
* Make friends and play with them
* Message your friends
* Open a discussion in the forums
* Post or read tutorials
* Join social Groups with people that share the same interest or topic of Animal Crossing with you
* Show your love towards Animal Crossing

# Why does this platform exist?

Since the recent release of the new Animal Crossing game, it came as a surprise how big that game actually is. I think to make this game really enjoyable, you need friends to play with. If you have got no friends in real life that play Animal Crossing, you came to the right place.

I also thought to provide our users a social-like platform in which you can message and post, much like in a Facebook or Reddit, modern fashion. Thus this platform was born.

Obviously it is quite empty right now, but I would love to see Animal Crossing Lounge growing and therefore would kindly ask you to take a look!",4,1585494631,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr7b92/i_developed_a_social_media_platform_dedicated_to/,NintendoSwitch,1

fr77u6,ShockzHybrid,Every pair of joycons drifting in handheld mode. Help!,"Here's as short as I can make it.



Both my boyfriend and I have a switch. I recently got animal crossing for switch and about 2 days ago I noticed my left joycon kept drifting left. Today it got so bad I couldn't handle it and switched out my joycons with his. Now his have never had any issues. He plays handheld all the time and no drift. I plugged in his joycons and what do you know! The left joycon is still drifting to the left. Now the really weird thing. It only happens while playing Animal Crossing. Open up smash, no drift. Open up Pokemon, no drift. Mario kart, no drift. Even stardew valley, no drift. I have no idea what is causing this and nothing is fixing it. I can't recalibrate because the drift isn't constant. It will work normally for a few minutes then get out of control for a few. I tried doing controller updates but that doesn't help either. If I play connected to a TV and use a pro controller it's fine. There has been no damage to the switch or any of the joycons. Frankly I haven't used it much before animal crossing. 



I haven't been able to find anyone with the same issue and it's super frustrating. Any suggestions?",0,1585494257,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr77u6/every_pair_of_joycons_drifting_in_handheld_mode/,NintendoSwitch,1

fr5sv9,g1lby,Cooling fan stopped working and battery issues,"Hi everyone!
I recently encountered several problems with my Switch and I‘m starting to believe that all of those are somehow linked together.
But first things first.
My console always had some kind of charging and/or connectivity issue regarding the joycons. Sometimes they were charging, sometimes only one joycon was charging properly.
I didn’t use the console too often and I had a lot of other stuff on my mind until now, until the covid19 lockdown.🙃
That‘s when I also found out, that after playing 30mins of Luigis Mansion 3 (or any other game, but not in the home screen) my Switch always turns itself off due to overheating issues. 
So I pried it open and was prepared to see a lot of dust, but nothing - all clean. Also, as of now, my JoyCons aren’t charging at all on my device.
I compared the battery life from full to empty with a friend‘s console. We could observe a high discrepancy between the two devices until mine turned itself off.
I started Luigis Mansion while the console was open and realized that the fan isn’t running at all, so this explains the overheating issue.
The joycons are working like a charm if I connect them to my friend’s device.

TL;DR: 
The main question I have here is: Can a defective battery result in JoyCons not charging and the fan not running?",2,1585488082,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr5sv9/cooling_fan_stopped_working_and_battery_issues/,NintendoSwitch,1

fr4n8i,Ninten-Doh,How does animal crossing work with G Sharing,"So I’ve just set us G sharing with my daughter. It lets her download all my games and we can both play them online together. Ive set her switch as my primary so it doesn’t ask her to sign in but my switch is always online so it works fine. 

I want to get her animal crossing but I don’t know how the whole island thing/main user works. If I purchase it on MY eshop account but she uses it on HER account, will there be any complications? 

Right now her switch has my profile (which is the primary) and her profile (which she will be playing all the games I’ve purchased on)

My switch has just my profile on it (which requires internet to load any game)

The reason I want to purchase it on my eshop account is the free points to add to mine so I can buy us more games.",3,1585482109,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr4n8i/how_does_animal_crossing_work_with_g_sharing/,NintendoSwitch,1
fr4il5,jameszka997,Switch is a mess of a hardware,"I bought a secondhand Switch 3 months ago in pristine condition. 1 month ago I started having the infamous joy-con drift in my left joy-con (did not pat too much attention as it did not really impact my FE Three Houses playthrough) and 1 day ago I got the 2162-0002 problem which according to my research is problem based on auto wifi connecting when the Switch is docked, possibly due to some pins in the Wifi card being faulty or acting up.

I have had Ds, 3ds and Wii before. All 3 of them worked pristinely and had to repair none of them. 3 months into the Switch I have the infamous joycon issue and a switch breaking issue which if I cannot sort out makes me lose all my game data because offering cloudsave only goes for a shitty and barely functioning online subscription.

Context: So Ive been playing a lot of animal crossing recently and I've been noticing that my switch's left controller drifts to the left when I leave my switch idle at times.

Borrowed a friend's controllers before with same colors and no different markings (but his switch was the older version, and he mentioned having drift issues with his controllers), so now this leads me to the assumption that we accidentally swapped controllers. I didn't really make the effort to jot down the serial code before I got rid of the box, so now my only lead is the find controller feature...

Alternatively, are there any other ways that I can find out if a controller is not mine?",8,1585476248,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr3mbr/does_the_find_controller_for_switch_display/,NintendoSwitch,1

fr3h2g,Purpleafro237,Which is more enjoyable: Bayonetta or Assassins Creed?,"I'm having a difficult time deciding on getting Bayonetta1+2 or Assassins Creed Rebel Collection for the Switch. 

I have never played either franchises or related before, but the premises intrigues me. 

Here's what I have gathered so far: 

Bayonetta seems to be enjoyable both 1 and 2 by many people and is rated very high in Metacritic overall.
Biggest problem would be the price and that the play time is much much shorter in comparison to AC Rebel.

AC Rebel lots of people claim Black Flag is the most fun out of the AC series but gets dragged down by the Rogue campaign.
But its generally cheaper and have much longer play time value. 

I know these two titles are very different; hack n slash vs pirate but I would greatly appreciate which of the two you have enjoyed playing more of or is worth getting.",17,1585475410,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr3h2g/which_is_more_enjoyable_bayonetta_or_assassins/,NintendoSwitch,1

Would the standard SD card suffice, atleast for now? Only game I plan to get at purchase would be New Horizons, and it would be digital.

Am I better getting a standard switch or a switch lite, if I only want to play the exclusives? And do I need a screen protector or anything else? I've tried googling it and it only confused me more so I wondered if anyone here would be able to better assist me.

I've had my switch for just about a year now and, like many other people, I just noticed that my left Joy con doesn't quite lock onto the console anymore. Looking at it, it looks like there's a small chip where it locks into place and that this is a common issue that people have had. 

I'd love to send it in for repair but am really hesitant to do so, since they don't guarantee sending back the same color and I can't afford eBay prices to replace the Eevee color. 

I'm curious as to whether people who have sent it in for repair got back their exact Joy con or if Nintendo replaced the whole controller or if there's an easy fix that I could do myself.

I was hoping for more info on BOTW2 and a new Kirby game (love that little guy.) the 7 month gap definitely didn’t help things, there are so many games we just have logos for also but nope... I’m hoping this was because they’re gonna do a better one around the time of E3 (it was cancelled if you didn’t know.) This is the first and (hopefully) only time where I didn’t care for a single thing in this direct.

Anyway, sorry for the rant and me probably being a tad harsh but I wanted to just kinda get it out there.",52,1585470525,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr2nsj/the_recent_direct_was_awful_imo/,NintendoSwitch,1
fr2llc,Wolf_Erik,Stuck Pixel on my 3 days old Switch,"Hey Guys.

I preordered a brand new Animal Crossing Switch on Amazon. The delivery was dated to the 6th of April, but it came early (this week).

That's why I decided to start a new Animal Crossing Island and let my old one (with 50h playtime) behind me. 

Yesterday I was playing and enjoying AC on my new Switch and suddenly a little light grey point appeared. I think it's a stucked Pixel.

Could you help me to maybe fix it? I tried to massage it with gently touching it. I also started a video (stuck pixel fix) and played it for 5 hours. Completely shutting down my Switch over night hasn't helped either. 

I really don't want to send my Switch away, I don't want to start a new Island and I'm worried that they don't have any AC-Switches in stock. And with Corona everywhere I guess everything should take weeks. 

I hope you can understand everything, sorry for my English. :)",10,1585470138,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fr2llc/stuck_pixel_on_my_3_days_old_switch/,NintendoSwitch,1

Basically do you guys think that Pokemon Sword and Shield ver. of the Switch Lite is something that Nintendo is still producing? I actually did own this version of it before but sold because i was at a time where i needed the money. I did check the Nintendo website for info  (like 5 days ago) and I mean, they still use that version in some of the pictures on the site and it did say it would be in stock soon.

So I was okay that but when I went on it again just to check I can't for the life of me find where it said it would be restocked soon. So now i'm just not too sure because i know some of these Special editions are limited stock. 

After emailing Nintendo just to ask about it they said they didn't know when they would get getting new stock of it, and i just left it at that, i mean with it being stressful times with everything going on right now i didn't want to be an annoyance. I know there are other colours but, that specific colour way just looks sooo good! The light grey with the red and blue?! Fire! T\_T I mean i guess i could see if the shop i sold it to still has it but right now closed because of this virus and if not that Id rather buy it new not to boujee or anything i just have a very weird complex about buying things used haha. Also the sites selling it right now look really dodgy imo so i don't wanna risk it with them.

I've been surprised by how good he is at it, but of course, some games are too complicated. So far his favorites are Lego City Undercover and Lego Incredibles. He can play these almost entirely on his own, while New Super Mario Bros seems to be a bit more frustrating. It's hard to tell how difficult/frustrating a game is from videos and reviews, so I wondered if my fellow Redditors had any good recommendations. 

So far I'm considering Lego Marvel Superheroes 2 (Lego has been a winner so far), Spyro the Dragon,  and Animal Crossing (which I've never played and know nothing about), but I've never played these and I'm not super sold on any of them.

Any suggestions?

It occurred to me yesterday that, while it's in sleep, it's still to, an extent, ""on"". I then considered that the system can also perform system or game updates while in sleep mode if connected to WiFi. My question is, do people consider it safe to use sleep mode if, between gaming sessions, you keep your Switch in a tight fit case with no real room to breath? Would it even heat up enough in sleep mode for this to be a problem in the first place?

fqysav,Namnrocinu,Nintendo Games for Family,"Hello,

I just purchased a Switch Lite. I plan on buying Animal Crossing digitally so I can play this with my daughter. I currently have two PS4's and while having one as the primary my daughter can login and play my purchased games and I can play on the other PS4 as my account. My plan is to have my primary account on the TV Switch (to be purchased) and have my account also on the Lite. That way we can both play games together online. My question comes that I saw that non-primary accounts need to be online. What happens when I travel and my daughter wants to play the Lite while driving/flying. There won't be internet - does that mean she will not be able to play games?

Hope I am understanding the rules. And if I understand them correctly this is a really bad ""family"" setup. I would need to purchase games twice to play together with my daughter instead of Nintendo knowing they are in my family circle.

Sorry if this isnt the right thread for this sub but didn't see anything against it in the rules


I have a 6 month old switch, not sure which version it was secondhand (but unused), ive updated the console and joycons, turned it on and off, its not modded in anyway, everything (seems to) work properly. 


Ive recently noticed that when i have it docked charging at night (bad habit for battery life ik) it makes a sort of regular  clunking sound every few seconds. At first i thought it was the pipes in my house playing up or the wind making my window move but then i noticed the switch seemed to be quietly vibrating in time with the clunks (short vibrations, less than 1/4 of a second i reckon) 
All apps were closed, it was in sleep mode. 

Its annoying as hell so ive just moved it to another room for now. 


Tl;dr has anyone had/heard of their switch vibrating quietly every few seconds when docked? And if so know a fix?

1. I don’t really care if it doesn’t have DST or hamlet. Been More Of a solo player most of my life.
2. With the updates that I can only believe to be pushed out for the game is it still as “unplayable” as some of my research has led me to believe? (6+ months on average are the review times that I saw)

fqwv5g,Justifis,Left Joy Con Won't Connect To Switch Wirelessly,"Looking for some advice. My Joy Con works perfectly fine when connected to the Switch in handheld mode, but when I remove it from the Switch, it infinitely tries to connect to the Switch. The sync lights still come on and flash back and forth, but it never connects.

This started yesterday. I was playing Animal Crossing when the left Joy Con stopped sending input to the Switch. It was still on and seemed to be connected, but none of the inputs worked. I disconnected the Joy Con only to have it completely stop connecting to the Switch wirelessly altogether.

Things I've tried:

Pressing the sync button to reset the Joy Con and then attempting to connect.

Placing the Joy Con directly next to the switch when trying to sync.

Turning airplane mode on and back off.

Sliding the Joy Con onto the Switch and back off.

Disconnecting all controllers in the system settings, turning the Switch completely off, turning it back on, and pairing the Joy Cons again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm out of ideas on what to try. Any help is greatly appreciated. If it's any help, I was an early Switch adopter with a left Joy Con that has trouble staying connected unless it's within a few feet of the system. With the repair services being closed, I'm not beyond taking the Joy Con apart myself and attempting to fix it.",0,1585444255,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqwv5g/left_joy_con_wont_connect_to_switch_wirelessly/,NintendoSwitch,0

Unfortunately, this remedy leads to another problem - the silicon leaves streaks on the back of the Switch.

I'm curious to know for those of you who have this grip, is there a way to get rid of the streaks caused by the silicon? Is it even worth worrying about? It does take some force to fit the Switch into the grip as silicon is particularly sticky, so I'm assuming that causes the streaks.",2,1585441468,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqw3o7/satisfye_zengrip_pro_still_leaves_marks/,NintendoSwitch,0

fqw2z4,thisbirch221,What is your favorite Nintendo switch game and are you enjoying the system 😁,Hi so I have been a switch owner since day 1 and I have to say I am pretty happy with what's being offered!. I only buy first party titles or titles that are switch exclusive as I prefer to keep everything else on my PC but besides that I've always loved Nintendo's offerings when it comes to their first party titles.  mario odyssey is my personal favorite as I've loved all of the 3D mario games. Even though this game is controversial as to whether it's good or not I personally love Mario Sunshine and it's one of my favorite games aswell. While they're not the same I think just running around in such a large open space was wonderful. And breath of the wild was fantastic aswell!. I am not sure if I should consider these a downside or not but I am not happy with the performance in some games. The resolution I can understand and yeah I have been a bit spoiled by playing on PC but I was saddened to see games like BOTW and Astral Chain just chug at times. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is my favorite RPG on the switch and that game had so many frame dips it was unbelievable. The game would drop it's resolution way below 720p docked and as someone who has a 1440p Monitor you can really notice it. I also wish I had folders so I can organize my games and more support for classic games. Other than that I can't really say I have any issues!,108,1585441396,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqw2z4/what_is_your_favorite_nintendo_switch_game_and/,NintendoSwitch,4

The real nightmare comes at night. If I put the brightness too low, I can't see the screen that well. Too high and my eyes feel like they're on a fryer, which leads to painful headaches. The darker the room, the greater the pain. And in areas where you can't bring any external light source to balance out the brightness, that becomes a massive problem. 

A blue light filter has become standard on most smart phones, tablets, and computers. You can find the feature on even the cheapest smart phones on the market. 

Having such a feature would provide much comfort for folks like me who deal with light sensitivity or eye strain (when it comes to digital screens) in general. I would like to bring some awareness to this issue, in part because it's something simple that could be fixed with a simple update.

Edit: I know blue light filter glasses exist. It would still be a good idea given that A; some people can't afford or access the glasses, and B; it provides convenience for a lot of people.",40,1585437600,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqv0t5/the_switch_needs_a_blue_light_filter/,NintendoSwitch,8

Both at the same time while working my phone all in my lap. He (YouTube guy) says you have to have 25 GB free internal (lots of work removing stuff off internal) and not have a subscription to Nintendo online. Just a whole freaking  bunch of steps. I do everything he says. the end of video is quickly approaching. He sets a 3ds game physically on top of the switch. Now it's ""on"" the switch.i wasted almost 20 good minutes on this including this post. I haven't told my wife yet. She hasn't asked what nonsense I'm into but I gotta admit how dumb I am.

fquo9y,KairosDialga,Which gamecube-like pro controller is better?,"I've been looking at the Hori, PDP, or the PowerA controllers that have the gamecube-like layout. (Specifically the wired versions, since for some reason they feel better to me wired as opposed to wireless) and honestly, I want to get some people's opinions as to how each of them feel in comparison to each other.

I know some of you guys are going to say if you want something to use as a main controller just get the official pro controller instead of one of the offshoot ones, honestly it isn't price that is deterring me, but I have used my friend's official pro controller for a short bit before and honestly I'm just still not too fond of how it feels to me.

Also to preemptively answer another thing, yes I do have an adapter with a few official gamecube controllers which I mainly use for Smash Bros. I can use them effortlessly with some games (Like Pokemon) but there are other games in my library which require use of certain buttons that the original gamecube controllers lack, so unfortunately I cannot use them for everything like I want to.

Either way, any and all opinions on the builds and comparisons of those brand 'GCN-like' controllers would be helpful so I can decide which would be the best one to get at some point.",4,1585436416,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fquo9y/which_gamecubelike_pro_controller_is_better/,NintendoSwitch,0

fqugde,_detour,Nicknames are different across two systems but linked to one Nintendo Account. Which name do others see?,"I have a puzzle that I can't seem to find the answer for anywhere. This is my setup right now:

* Nintendo Switch (Primary) - user profile nickname: A
* Nintendo Switch (Non-Primary) - user profile nickname: B

Both user profiles are linked to the same Nintendo Account, so my list of friends, history, etc. are all shared.

I thought changing the profile nickname on one Switch will propagate that change to all other linked Switches, but that didn't happen. So now that I got two different profile names:

1. Which one will show up when I play online?
2. Will others who've already added me before the name change see the new name or old name?
3. What about people who add me after I've changed my name?

If anybody knows the answer to this puzzle, I'd appreciate your sharing!

For those who aren't familiar with the game, here's how I described it in my small review (also available [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/anew46/a_quick_tangledeep_review_dungeon_crawling_done/)):

&amp;nbsp;

**Quick description:** The game is a 2D dungeon crawler - turn-based.  If you've played mystery dungeon-style games, it's this sort of thing.  Tangledeep offers plenty of difficulty options:  it can be rogue-like with permadeath, or more forgiving (player loses XP, etc. during death instead).  

&amp;nbsp;

**Consider this game if you enjoy:** Tales of Maj'Eyal, DCSS, Dungeonmans, Diablo, Shiren the Wanderer, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, Disgaea

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:**  Here's the [official dev post from the \roguelikes subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/fpgei6/tangledeep_on_switch_gets_a_major_update_today/) which has more details on which DLC is free / purchasable.

fqsxr1,-Crave-,"Bought new console, having issues with animal crossing and switch mobile app. Help please...","I recently bought Animal Crossing which I'd never played before, turns out I love it. So I purchased an Animal Crossing Switch Console... I was able to log in, and transfer save data for most of my games.

However, Animal Crossing doesn't transfer any save data. Okay, I can deal with that. I lose a week and a half of progress, but that's okay.  I also set the new console as the primary console during the transfer process. I also factory reset the old console immediately before I sold it.

On the old console I sent all of my cool items and money to my friends in gifts and I believe I removed the console from my nintendo account entirely. On the new console, it won't let me play without verifying that the other console isn't playing my games first. Plus, all of my friends who play animal crossing still show my old account on their list. It shows active and they've mistakenly sent gifts to a console I no longer own. It's tolerable to have to re-add my friends, but less so to have my old account sitting there dead for mixups when we're sending things.

On top of that, the nintendo switch app on my mobile phone refuses to register my new island/info. I've logged out, logged back in. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app...

This is all getting incredibly infuriating. I sold my old switch and it's not an option to ""get it back"" even temporarily.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Getting a new console broke all of my stuff.

How do I remove my dead island/character from my friends ""best friends"" lists?

How do I connect the nintendo switch app on my mobile phone to my new switch console and new animal crossing island?

fqsdig,davinitupoverhere,"Fuck Nintendo for its one-island-per-console rule. You expect everyone to either know this ahead of time, or buy two consoles to get around it? During a global pandemic and Switch shortage? Fuck you.","No, I don’t read news about Animal Crossing years in advance. This was going to be my
first game, and my wife’s first game, so I bought it for the two of us.

She plays with it for a couple of days and says she’s loving it. I go to finally make a character and am told I’m moving onto HER island! Wtf?

My wife and I have two completely different aesthetics; I don’t want to play her island. I want my own island! People are already moving onto her island and I didn’t get to experience any of that. Or any of the discovery. It sucks.

This is also how no other Nintendo game operates. Imagine launching Breath of the Wild but townspeople have been met and quests have already been completed. That would suck major ass. It does in this case.

I’m really pissed about this. I can’t buy another Switch console for this - on principle, but also because THERE’S A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND A SWITCH SHORTAGE. 

THIS IS BULLSHIT THAT CAN BE FIXED WITH SOFTWARE, BUT THE COMPANY EXPECTS US TO BUY MORE OF THEIR AGING FUCKING HARDWARE. THIS GAME IS SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU RELAX?

PC players are cheating, able to see your HP, loadout and more. They use full chat and more.

This game is a total disaster on the multiplayer side for Switch. No friends play, joy con sticks versus PC players, stuttering and glitches. Now massive gameplay imbalances and outright cheating.

fqs55k,mistagoodwin,Split Pad Pro Colors,"So I have the Hori Split Pad Pro and it’s been a total game changer. Lack of rumble aside, it’s changed me from a nearly exclusively tv mode guy to a nearly exclusively handheld guy. However, I don’t like the red/black aesthetic and don’t really understand branding such a great accessory to such a niche game. For me, one of the awesome things about the switch is the good feeling I have from the overall UX of the product design/colors/ease of use to pick up and play quickly. The SPP (split pad pro) makes my hands want to hold my switch but my eyes hate the site of it. 

I mean, I would even go so far as to say that if they released it in more Nintendo-esque colors, the thing would almost assuredly sell better!

I sure hope Nintendo or third party’s come up with some alternate colors or shell replacements.

Also, for context, I have the Satisfye grip and have tried a few others.  The SPP’s joysticks and buttons, ergonomics, and d pad just make it hard to want to go back to regular joy cons.

TL;DR: The split pad pro is awesome to play on but is hideous and needs to be released in nintendo-esque colors and freed from its strange link to a niche game’s brand.",10,1585428229,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqs55k/split_pad_pro_colors/,NintendoSwitch,1

fqrh25,Blackmasha2,1 switch console with 2 accounts but only one is able to play games - no way to change ownership permanently?,"I have a switch console I want to give to my sister who is going to visit our mother. I wanted to remove my own account so she won't have access to my credit card and email. but I had a weird problem where other accounts couldn't play if my own account was deleted.

then I found out that email access can't be saved (I hope) so she won't be able to use my account for anything other than playing games.

so I decided ""well I'm not using the console anyway"" so I wanted to make her an account where she would be able to buy more games if she wants to with her own credit card. but apparently this entire thing works in a strange way. despite having the same console, only I am able to purchase games, a new account is not able to even enter the store. all she can do with her linked to Nintendo site email is enter a redeem code.

is there a way for me to make her the owner of the console (remember this is all 1 console, not 2) so she can keep playing the games I bought while being able to use the store on her own account? if not, is there a way for me to transfer the game to her account permanently? is there even a way to make her account the owner of the switch console?

what if I change my registered Email to her Email, and change my credit card to hers, will that allow her to keep playing the games I bought and full access to the store? (as in ownership transfer?) 

remember this isn't a scam, I paid for this console and she is a family member, if I wish to transfer everything to her I should be able to. **I am not moving games to another Switch console**, simply giving another person my entire collection of games and store access (with their own credit card and email)",8,1585426136,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqrh25/1_switch_console_with_2_accounts_but_only_one_is/,NintendoSwitch,1

fqq9el,verdict0224,Pokemon would be a lot more successful if the developers actually listened to players and gave them what they want,"I'm a longtime Pokemon fan, but one thing I hate is the fact that it's so hard for me to play older games. I would have to buy a 2DS console for a couple hundred dollars, and then, pay another couple hundred just be able to play HeartGold or SoulSilver because of how rare it is. which obviously isn't worth it because that game is definitely not worth the hundreds upon hundreds of dollars that they're asking for. Newer games that come out are nothing like what we expected or wanted. I've been looking forward to a Pokemon game that actually lets you play as an adult and has the old school nostalgic feelings attached to it for a long while. But that's not what Pokemon sword is like. Which is fine. Some people obviously like how sword and shield are. But I'm left wanting something death feels like gold and silver, Ruby and Sapphire, black and white. 


It's just sad to see the Pokemon brand dwindle and decline so heavily because they refused to listen to what the players want.

fqq0wq,dominodave,10 Tips to make ARMS a real WORKOUT!,"Hello all, with ARMS being free right now and people trying it out, I wanted to share this list of tips I put together from when the game first came out.  I noticed this topic being addressed very briefly, but not much time spent on it at all, and I thought I would make a post that outlined some of my personal tips.

Before doing that, a bit more background about me.  Without getting into much detail, I'm actually quite a bit of a fitness junkie.  I also play Ring Fit Adventure, but before that was available, I also played this.  I don't at all think of myself as a ""meat head,"" but I find exercising to be a very healthy and satisfying activity, both as a way to stay physically healthy, and as a way to unwind and reduce stress.  Besides gaming, it's my favorite thing to do.  I started boxing several years ago, and love it.  I find it to be the kind of exercise where you forget that you are even exercising because you are too busy thinking about what you are doing.  This is one of the reasons I've always had trouble running, because it just gets boring, and after a few minutes, all I can think to myself is how out of breath I am and that I want to stop.  Ultimately the key to a good cardio workout is to occupy your mind so that you're not even thinking about such things, and Arms being a game about boxing, does this even better than boxing itself!  Unrelated, but my other favorite sporting activities are Tennis, and Climbing, though neither of them hold a candle to my joy for Boxing, but unsurprisingly they each have a lot in common in terms of usage of basic principles, many of which I outline below.

Arms is unlikely to be a complete workout, and it will always help to mix in some push ups, sit ups, maybe a light jog, pull ups / chin ups, weight lifting, etc., but with these tips, I'm actually pretty confident that you could supplement it as a real and effective workout.

1.  **Joycons not Pro Controller** - Obviously, it goes without even needing to be said that moving your arms will obviously be more effective than pushing a few buttons, and ultimately, if you're not doing this, the rest of these tips are meaningless.

2.  **Stand while playing** - Combined with using the joycons and standing, you'll find yourself moving around a bit here and there, which is as much of an improvement for your legs as it is your arms by using the joycons.

3.  **Bend your knees** - Make sure you are bending your knees slightly as often as possible, as this is critical in making sure you are balancing your weight equally between your legs.  It actually makes you use your leg muscles rather than leaning on your legs, which is also a critical part of the next tip.

3.  **Maintain good posture** - Look up some videos or pictures of boxing stances, but ultimately try to maintain a good posture, keep your feet at about shoulder width, and a 60% angle of one another, with your lead foot at the 75% point and your back foot at the 15% point assuming the ninety degree mark being a direct line to your opponent.  Your lead foot in front, and your off foot in the back.  Does not matter which one you choose, ultimately it's based on your personal preference, and this is a rough guideline as you want to find the stance that is most comfortable while also making sure your center of gravity is at your core (diaphram/torso area).  Keep your back straight, and make sure you are holding your arms in front of your face, or at least at shoulder level.  Ultimately the end result of all of this is that you should feel like nothing could knock you over.

5.  **Don't ""flick"" your wrists** - When you are punching, try to actually punch.  This was probably the most frustrating part of watching people talk about playing with or without Joycons.  People playing the game like they are playing the drums is absolutely the worst thing you could do.  That is, try to keep your forearms, wrists, and fists in a straight line, and do not bend your wrists at all.  When you go for punches, do it with your shoulders and arms.  This will likely be the hardest part of adjusting.  If you are having trouble, I recommend taking a few introductory boxing classes, as this will be one of the first things you'll be asked to focus on (in addition to everything else mentioned previously).

6.  **Get into it!** - Combine all of the above, make the game an extension of your body, not only will this make you a better fighter and player, a better boxer, but you'll get a lot of exercise without even realizing it, while having fun!  Lean into the dodges and punches, and when you are turning your arms to move left or right, make it a part of moving your entire torso rather than just your hands.  Move your legs to corresponding positions and then move them back, keep your stance!

7.  **Breathe!** - Maintaining proper breathing is a skill that takes a lifetime to master, no matter what it is you are doing.  Take full breaths, hold it, and then take full exhales.  While you are playing you won't have this kind of time, but you want to try to replicate it on a micro-level.  Breath in quickly through your nose (but still deeply), and then almost spit the air out while you are punching.  This makes your punches faster and more effective, and also gives you a good way to regulate your air intake and outtake.  With a bit of practice, you'll almost always be shooting air out of your mouth/nose, almost completely overlapping the breaths you are taking in.  I cannot stress how important this is despite how basic it sounds.

8.  **Play for an hour** - You'll be surprised but after 20-30 minutes, you'll probably notice yourself sweating, if not sooner.  Don't stop there, keep going, play for at least an hour so that it is a proper exercise and your body is burning calories.  When you start getting hot, sweating, this is when you will start to feel the burn.  If you are resting, it takes a while to get warmed up, as well as cool down, so take advantage of this time.  Finally a tip that tells you to play play video games for at least one hour!

9.  **Stretch** - Before and after, even between matches within reason.  Stretching is itself a workout, gives your muscles a chance to warm up and cool down, while making sure that the exercise you did was effective in the first place.  If you skip stretching, you're really reducing the value of the workout. The best part about stretching is that it's so easy!  Reach both arms for the sky, touch your toes, stretch your legs, take as much time as you want stretching, but make sure you aren't just resting unless it is post-workout.  You'll notice yourself feeling sore the next day, and the day after, and so on, and stretching is critical in reducing your muscle soreness so as not to skimp on your next workout, but the soreness is good!  Consume some protein, as well as modest amounts of carbohydrates (energy).

10.  **Drink water** - This is just general health advice, but drink a lot of water.  Preferably a bit before you start playing/stretching, and a few sips while playing, and then chug after you are done.  Make sure you stay hydrated, but do not let yourself get too bloated either as this will make you less nimble and flexible, and in addition to making you more sluggish, which will make you slower in the game itself.

As I said earlier, I definitely recommend an intro boxing class or two, and learn the movements, and try to replicate them and tie them into the game itself.  It is good to learn the movements, but they don't translate completely laterally, so it isn't necessary, however as an intro: Jab (1), Cross (2), Left Hook (3), Right Hook (4), Left Uppercut (5), Right Uppercut (6).  These are the six moves and the numbers they coincide with.  The motions for Arms are a bit different where you maybe want to keep your arm out longer before you snap it back, but follow the motions all the same.  You won't really be getting into Uppercuts, but the Jabs (main hand punch), Cross (Offhand punch), and Hooks (angled outer hits), will be your bread and butter in this game, along with moving, dodging, jumping, etc.

And that's it!  I believe you could do these things every day, and have a seriously rock solid workout that gives you a bit of everything your body needs.  As I said earlier, it helps to supplement with some push ups, sit ups, light weight lifting and jogging, and etc., but if you hate that stuff, don't worry about it, and just focus on making the game more effective for you.  Seriously, if you could do this every day, you'll be shocked at the results you see in only two weeks.  After that, your first month will provide dramatic results, after which the results will tend to diminish since your body is adjusting, and you will need to start pushing yourself more.  Thankfully as you climb the ranks, the difficulty curve should naturally adjust and help you in this regard.  It's the same as boxing!

You're probably initially going to have a tough time against people using pro controllers, but I personally love showing off my ability to move each of my arms around independently, albeit a small advantage.  Once you get the hang of it though, I personally for example, couldn't imagine doing it any other way.  Not only is it more intuitive, but the game is more about strategically making sure you're doing the right move at the right time.  You'll definitely have some trouble throwing out punches instead of grabs and vice versa, but that's the price to pay to make sure you're getting a workout!  Don't let those guys with a pro controller dissuade you though, you're getting a workout, and becoming a better boxer, while having fun playing a video game!

Some other tips I've seen here and there, using weights like ankle or wrist weights.  Personally, I do not recommend this at all.  You'll only be putting an artificial barrier between you and the game which is making your workout less effective, as well as less natural for yourself.  If you know what you are doing and find yourself able to do all of the above without breaking a sweat, play more than an hour.  If that doesn't work, or you want to keep it within an hour, put more energy into your punches and snaps back, or more into your movement and such.  If you've done all that, and still want to make it more of a workout, then you can add weight, but until you have a strong frame of reference of your own body-weight, using added weights will mostly get in the way, but if you get to that point, you're going to be the best judge for yourself.

Once you have practiced, you'll notice yourself tying it all together naturally, building muscle memory around your own movement and how it ties with jumping or dodging or dashing, etc.  You'll be getting a tremendous workout and you won't even know it!

I'll try to update this list and clean it up, including maybe adding in some reference links for posture and stance and good habits for punching and stuff, but hopefully you're also feeling encouraged to do a bit of research and practice on your own.  Hope the above guidelines are helpful, and would love to hear about situations where this is maybe an assumed standard for playing among fans of the game like myself.  Look forward to your feedback, and save that Pro Controller for Mario/Zelda!  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer.

fqpuni,amoiyyy,Nintendo Switch's audio stops working after sleep mode?,"Hello all!

I recently got my first Switch (yay!), but the week after I received it, I noticed that there were some audio issues. I've been trying to figure out what's going on with it; unfortunately, I haven't had any leads. I asked a couple friends who have Switches, but none of them have had this issue, older gen or not. I also contacted Nintendo's support, but they apparently haven't encountered this before, so I thought I'd ask here (wanted to cover all the bases if I could!).

The issue is that, despite my console's volume being on, the audio stops working after entering sleep mode. This happens randomly. At first, I thought it was dock-related as I had experienced it a couple times after putting the console to sleep mode -&gt; docking + charging -&gt;  removing it from the dock for use. However, it would happen when my console was not in dock either (i.e. after it has entered sleep mode automatically, afk in-game -&gt; sleep -&gt; waking it up to no audio despite having audio before). My current solution to this is just restarting the Switch (just a bit tedious to do every single time but LOL), but I was curious as to if anyone else experienced this and/or a similar situation and what you did to fix it?

fqpcrs,Suikodont,Just finished The Messenger. Great game!,"I bought the game a while ago and actually put it down after playing it for the first time. I don't know why but it didn't click with me right away.

Picked it up last week and basically couldn't stop playing. I'm close to 100% the main game (just need all those toys...) and just finished the dlc. Without spoiling anything: the ending was hilarious and awesome. Gotta ""do the thing"" again soon for how fun it was. Wacky as hell, as is everything in the game, in an incredibly fun way. Actually appreciated the little storekeeper stories as well. Got kinda sweet at the end.

The movement and gameplay are among the best in their league, in my opinion. It can get a little trial and error-y at times but, as you can jump into action almost immediately, it's easy to get into the ""one more try""-loop that actually left me genuienly proud of myself for having accomplished things I thought to be near impossible upon first try.

I've yet to try new game + but I'm hesitant as long as there's still stuff to do in my main save file. What are the differences from NG apart from the obvious higher difficulty? Is there any reward or difference to the story?

I'm also eager to find out what that dlc mask is all about. Hope it's a little more exciting than the reward for breaking all the seals. Don't get me wrong.. the thing is cool and all (especially in boss fights)  but I expected a little more and was kinda disappointed.

Sometimes when it freezes the screen glitches out and goes crazy. Sometimes the switch makes a low buzzing sound when it freezes and very rarely the switch will freeze and become completely non responsive.

But new horizons has the same music 24/7 it seems. Is this just the way the series handles music now? Will there only be new music for special events?

It’s about time I brought a new game for my switch, but I’m unsure what to go for. I’ve got all the obvious ones - BOTW, Pokemon SwSh, Mario, etc. But i want something to invest my time in while in quarantine.

I’ve never played an animal crossing game before so idk if I’d like it, otherwise I’d buy that. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon looks cool but idk if I can warrant paying £50 for a remake! 

I guess my question is - what’s a good, long, RPG-esque game I could plug a lot of hours into? Or what’s a good game regardless of genre?

Although it is an older game now, it's very fun for jumping into an online lobby for a few quick matches. I'm currently riding out the 7 day free NSO from Animal Crossing and being able to keep playing ARMS would encourage me to resub. A sale would help keep the lobbies populated.

It would also maybe cause a sales boost and generate interest for the Smash character and possible sequel.

fqo22g,AMartin56,Help me find a game for my daughter that probably doesn't exist...,"My daughter is 6. We've kept her away from video games (my wife is not a fan) but with being home bound due to Covid-19 I thought  some interactive problem solving would be better than staring at a TV. 

We've tried Disneyland Adventures, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker and Super Mario Odyssey.  

Overall I'd say she's pretty smart and while just starting to read is picking it up pretty well. She can remember what the buttons do and understands how the game tells her which one to press once and awhile. 

Problem is she struggles with a 3D camera with right stick adjustments and gets frustrated.  Playing Disneyland Adventures with her must be what having a seizure is like. I'd say this is her biggest problem. Spatial relationships with things on screen. 

She'll play Mario Odyssey for a bit with its decent auto camera but when the first enemy shows up she panics and gets frustrated.  

If we play something co-op if I play better than her at all (and trust me I'm pretty much barely doing the minimum to keep the game going) she gets frustrated. 

Strangely enough we had the most success with Doom 64...me on the mouse. Her on WASD.  But I'd prefer to play something less violent.  

So she seems to enjoy non violent exploration that she can play by herself (with me in the room to offer tips) with a good auto following camera that won't need much adjusting.

My dad's switch works perfectly in the dock.

I couldn't really find anything about this online, apart from a response from Nintendo on the Nintendo forums that said any switch should work in any dock. I haven't yet tried docking my switch into the TV but I'm almost positive this will work as the dock definitely charges and the green light on the dock comes on.

fqjfsg,meeb,The story of Ring Fit Adventure makes me feel like an asshole,"The game is great for a work-out and has been heavily used during Corona Quarantine so that's not the issue. High recommended for anyone looking for an at-home fun work-out, see other user comments for reviews etc.

The issue is I can't help but feel like an asshole while playing it in adventure mode. As far as I can gather so far my ring companion is creepy (""your sweat is so shiny and beautiful!"") and is pretty much chasing down its old work-out partner who it seems just wants to go to the gym before you beat them up a lot. Somehow the evil guy working out is bad and he has to stop, but you working out is awesome.

By world 3 the villain is (maybe sarcastically, maybe not) offering to give the powers back voluntarily but no, you just smash him in the face and take them anyway. By world 4 he's outright calling you a stalker, which seems accurate given we keep chasing him down and then making him flee further from our wrath after another good beating. The only thing he seems to be doing is spreading some mysterious ""dark influence"" which there's no real confirmation it's bad so far other than creepy ring telling us it's bad.

Along the way you seem to beat up a whole menagerie of woodland and other cute creatures who shake in fear and watch with quivering eyes as you beat them into pulp.

I live in France and we've been confined for almost 2 weeks now. Thankfully I still go to work everyday so I can still get out but I work in healthcare and the days are pretty long and stressful. So I wanted to buy a Switch for the evenings but here the prices have aaaall gone up. A new switch is 400€ instead of the usueal 300€ for instance.

I haven’t had much experience using the Nintendo Switch Online app, but I’m struggling using the voice chat feature with Airpods... If I have them connected and then start a chat, they work for about a second before cutting off and disappearing from the Bluetooth menu completely! Then when the chat is over, they reappear...

We can play whenever we want without worrying whether my sibling is playing at the same time.


We can customize our consoles how we like to.


I can try a game my sibling already owns before purchasing a copy for myself.


We won’t fight when choosing who’s turn it is to play. If you have a sibling, you know it will happen.


Cons:


Will get costly especially when purchasing two copies of the same game we want.


People who only have one TV at home. Can’t play in docked at same time.


My personal preferences (the small things, ya’know?):


I can choose dark mode for console when they want light mode.


I’d rather purchase my games digitally.

fqhy8t,DoctorSteve,We need to restart Operation Rainfall on the Switch. We're already getting Xenoblade!,"For those of you who don't know, [Operation Rainfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rainfall) was a push by Nintendo fans to get three big RPGs released overseas. The most hyped one was [The Last Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Story), back when the creator of Final Fantasy formed his own studio and every game he touched was super hyped. This was one of them. The other big hitter of the three was Xenoblade Chronicles, crazy to think Nintendo didn't want to bring it to America given how successful the sequel is. And the third game is a game called [Pandora's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_Tower).

Now obviously we aren't hurting for RPGs on the Switch like the Wii was. But these were three in-demand titles at one point for one of Nintendo's biggest consoles, and their delayed release affected their results. Not to mention with the power of the Switch I am sure they could be represented at their best form. 

Neither remaining game is made by Nintendo, but I would like to see some form of buzz for these lost games!! Maybe we can get it trending on Twitter or something.

Now that i'm in a much better position financially and, well, we're in the midst of a pandemic. There's no better time to rebuy.

Money isn't an issue, so it's not a dealbreaker at all for either. But i'm leaning towards a Lite. I wasn't really a fan of the dock/undock mechanic in the OG Switch and found myself only playing handheld 90% of the time. Plus there's no good position for the dock near my TV either. So it just looks silly.

Is the Switch lite sufficient? I'll be playing pretty much all the big exclusives (BoTW. Animal Crossing, Pokemon) so i just want to make sure it's good and not super annoying long term to use.

fqh4t7,Ninten-Doh,Nintendo needs to put the phone app voice chat on the actual switch. Why can’t they,"It’s been over 3 years now and I find it hard to believe they can’t get the voice chat that’s on the phone app on the actual switch itself. I don’t mind using chat through their app but just put it on the switch. I honestly think nintendo japan don’t listen to a word of feedback outside of japan because almost everyone (who plays online) outside of japan has mentioned how bad it is to communicate with friends online on a video game system in 2020. That should be one of the easiest things to do as we’ve been doing it on other systems for over a decade now. 

I reckon if this subject got enough feedback and actually some how got to Nintendo I think they would actually be able to put the app (at least the voice chat side) on the actual switch. I think it would be quite easy for them but because no one mentions it they just seem to think everyone’s ok with the phone app. What other reason could there be other than that? They managed to get a console that lets you play on the go and straight onto a tv but can’t do something as simple as party chat on the system? I just find that extremely hard to believe. I mean they clearly want you to chat or else they wouldn’t even have done the phone app voice chat. 

So what do we do to get them to listen? It’s no point just saying “they won’t listen” or “I only play it for games”. That’s fine for you but what about the millions who do play online with friends on games like Mario kart, splatoon, smash, Mario tennis, animal crossing, rocket league, minecract and many more I’ve probably missed that people play together online.",16,1585389067,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqh4t7/nintendo_needs_to_put_the_phone_app_voice_chat_on/,NintendoSwitch,1

I don’t want to get my hopes too high until it’s confirmed and Best Buy doesn’t go “actually the website wasn’t supposed to let you order one, we don’t have any.” Because sometimes when I was trying to order off their site in the past week, I quickly click the “add to cart” button before it can load into “sold out,” so I click it and then try to check out and then it tells me I can’t. Basically I’m hoping that hasn’t happened here, but seeing as how they let me actually order it this time, and they have a set date for when it’s available, I’m not sure.

fqfjiu,Charrzooka,New Nintendo Switch not reliably charging!,"Hi all,

My Nintendo Switch is only 2 months old.

I've noticed quite frequently I will go to charge my Switch, leave it for a couple of hours, come back and it's still on low battery (often lower than what it was when I plugged it in). The charging symbol always comes up when I plug it in, but it doesn't seem to actually charge it.

Usually if I plug it out and back in a few times it starts charging, but it's so annoying because I have to sit there waiting a few minutes to see the percentage increase.

Why is it doing this? Is there any fix?

Bonus question: can the Switch charge when turned off? The only way to do so is to plug it in to charge and then turn it off. But does it still continue to charge? I think it's very silly that charging it when off forces the Switch to turn back on.

fqebnf,djf881,How to accelerate your progress in AC:NH using social features,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons has a number of social features. One commonly overlooked feature is the ability to visit the islands of friends or strangers. When you go to another player’s island, you can fish their waters, hunt their bugs, participate in their random events, interact with their visiting vendors and shop or sell in their stores. This creates efficiencies that are unavailable to players who play alone. The Nook Miles system also rewards you for traveling to visit other players or hosting them on your island.

**How to find other players to visit**

You can connect with other players in any forum where people discuss or play Animal Crossing, including Reddit, but Discord is my preferred method, because it shows players who are hosting visitors in real time, and you can coordinate with players to visit islands that further whatever your particular objective is.

Here are several things you might want to do on other players’ islands:

**Alternate hemisphere fish/bugs**

There are 80 fish and 80 bugs in the game, but most of them only appear at certain times of the year. Since the seasons are different in the northern and southern hemispheres, the schedules at which critters appear is different in the south than it is in the north.

That means that, if you are in the northern hemisphere, there are fish available on southern hemisphere players’ islands that you can’t catch on your own.

As it happens, Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched on March 20, 2020, and there are a bunch of fish that are spawning only through the end of March in the southern hemisphere that won’t be available again anywhere for months. Of particular note are the sharks that spawn in the ocean, which will not arrive in northern players’ games until June, and the salmon and king salmon which appear in the mouth of rivers one month each year in each hemisphere. After they leave the south on March 31, they will not be available until they arrive in the north in September.

**Turnip speculation**

Every Sunday morning from 6 am to noon local time, a vendor arrives on everyone’s island selling turnips. Each player gets a randomized price, usually between 90 and 110 bells per turnip at which they can purchase.

Starting Monday, Nook’s Cranny will buy turnips at a random price which changes every 12 hours, ranging from prices below 40 bells per turnip usually up to prices around 140-150. However, very rarely, the purchase price of turnips will be much higher, above 500 bells. If you can find a price like this when you have a big stash of turnips, you can instantly earn enough to fully upgrade your house. But if you have any turnips left over from the previous week when the vendor returns the next Sunday, the old ones will rot and you will lose your investment, so if you wait too long for the right price, you risk losing everything.

Networking with other players can completely eliminate this risk, because when you visit another player’s island, you get access to their shop and their turnip price. There are channels on the Discord where players with high prices host visitors to sell their turnips. Sometimes these players ask for a share of the profits to visit their island, but, for example, if you buy 4000 turnips at 100 bells each, and you sell them for 400 bells each on an island where the host demands 500,000 bells for visiting, you still net 700,000 bells in profits. And if you triple your money when you have 400,000 bells the first week you play and then triple your money again the next week, you can quickly pay off all of Tom Nook’s expansions.

**Meteor showers**

Some nights, randomly, meteor showers occur. If you look at the sky and press A while a star is falling, you can make a wish on the shooting star, and the next day, star fragments that you can use to craft magic wands will show up on your beach. These events only happen sporadically, at random in each player’s game, but you can find a host with a meteor shower on discord any night you want.

**Other vendors**

The rug vendor Sahara shows up a couple times a week with a small selection of rugs, wall coverings and floorings for sale. If you want, you can visit ten different islands each with a different sahara inventory using Discord. The inventory of seeds changes at Nook’s Cranny each day, but you can visit different islands to buy any seeds you might need. You only have one kind of fruit on your island, and you can only find one kind of non-native fruit through Nook Ticket mystery islands, but you can get all the fruits by visiting other players.

Basically, by connecting to a large network of other players, you can earn a lot more bells, fill your museum and collect furniture and other doodads much faster.

**Is it cheating?**

The other method of getting access to a lot of different vendor inventories and otherwise unavailable critters is “time traveling,” or messing with your system clock to speed up things that are supposed to take several days or instantly access stuff that isn’t supposed to be available for months.

Although there is no competitive aspect to Animal Crossing, and nothing you can exploit will negatively impact other players, time traveling is a cheat, in that it gives you access to a lot of stuff, a lot sooner than you’re able to get it playing in real time, and it undercuts the process of progressing toward goals over a period of days or months. It’s not an exploit, but leveraging an online community to optimize your play is such a powerful mechanic that it feels like one.

Visiting other players, unlike manipulating the system clock, is an intended use of the game mechanics rather than an exploit, but it can have a similar impact on your experience. If you visit a southern hemisphere island and catch all the sharks this week, it won’t be as exciting for you when they show up in your waters in June. But, if you don’t want to look at an empty aquarium in your museum for the next two months, this is a legit way to fill it up sooner.

Whether these activities are legit is a closer question when you’re visiting islands to take advantage of amenities obtained through other players’ clock exploits. For example, a 500 bell turnip price is, in theory, an event any player could legitimately encounter and share with the community on Discord. But odds are, the guy hosting a 500 bell turnip price found it by changing his clocks and checking prices over and over until he found his jackpot.

Similarly, if you are visiting an island with a shop you don’t have yet that the player you’re visiting obtained via time exploits, it’s hard to claim that’s legit. And if you consider seeing a time-traveled island to be a spoiler, then visiting random strangers puts you at great risk of being spoiled, since a large percentage of the community seems to be using clock exploits. However, in a couple of weeks a lot of legit players will have upgraded shops and it will be tougher to distinguish between a time-traveled island and a legit one.",3,1585374287,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqebnf/how_to_accelerate_your_progress_in_acnh_using/,NintendoSwitch,1

fqe2b4,TwoFirmFeet,AC... am I doing this wrong? Newcomers opinion on ACNH 1 week in.,"The beginning was goddamn amazing. It’s cute, charmful, unlocking basic recipes was fun, using tools to create more tools was fun, fishing new fish and discovering new bugs was a lot of fun, going through the encyclopedia was fun too. Fishing out random tools was surprising and fun. All of this stuff was *fun* because it was *new.* 

A week into this game and I’m still toying around with the same recipes, the same tools, seeing the same fish, fishing out the same crafting tools, etc. *Maybe* once a day I’ll get lucky and the game will drop me a unique recipe and that gives me incentive to find the rare items needed to craft it but for the most part I’m just grinding out fish to sell in order to buy a house so I can unlock the advanced recipes so I can actually progress in the freaking game. 

I feel like I’m the beginning, unless you time skip, you’re stuck with the same tools everyday. Wood, stones, iron nuggets, clay, common fish, common bugs. Good luck having fun crafting the same 10 things with those items. Once you create everything in your recipe book and once you hand in all the fish available for you to the Museum, you’re stuck twiddling your thumbs until the next day so you can *Maybe* be lucky and have a unique recipe dropped to you or have a good piece of furniture shaken out of a tree. NPCS on the island will rarely contribute to progression, but when they do its *fun.* My *only* complaint about this game is that they limit the *fun* you can have in a day. Why not have recipes drop every couple of hours? Why not *sell* advanced recipes? More side quests? 

I’m sure once I buy this expensive ass house the game will be fun again since I will have the advanced recipes unlocked, but until then, it’s a boring grind of catching and selling stuff. 

Anyone feel me? Am I doing this wrong?",21,1585373053,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqe2b4/ac_am_i_doing_this_wrong_newcomers_opinion_on/,NintendoSwitch,1
fqe1k1,martinman54,Do I lose my progress or deal with the drift? (Switch Lite),"So I picked up the switch lite on Wednesday and I’ve been playing new horizons quite a bit every day since. Today I noticed I am having the dreaded drift problem that many people have (already tried fixing with calibration). Since I’ve only had my switch lite for 3 days I’m thinking I will return it for a new one instead of waiting for the repair centers to open back up and have it fixed for free. Is there anything I can do to keep my progress? I’ve grinded the game pretty hard and am pretty far for only 3 days (I have all 3 new homes being built, have my 198,000 bell loan half paid off, and many bugs and fish waiting to be turned in when the new museum is finished, and over 10,000 miles currently). Im thinking I will have to start over because on the game site it says they are unable to transfer data from one switch to another. Do I deal with the drift problem until I can have it repaired and then be without it for weeks or just bite the bullet and restart now and get a new switch lite while I’m not very far into the game?",86,1585372955,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqe1k1/do_i_lose_my_progress_or_deal_with_the_drift/,NintendoSwitch,1

fqdpx7,4and90x,Question about the original packaging on a brand new switch. ..,"So I got pretty lucky and snagged a switch from my local best buy today. Was super excited! And aside from the curbside jabroni trying to touch my phone and not doing that great a job with personal space amidst this pandemic... I thought all went well and was overall happy to have my switch. That is until I got home.

I opened the box and found one of the joy cons was flashing which I thought was kinda odd but probably nothing. But as I unpacked the rest I realized that the tablet had some smudges and fingerprints all over the screen! Not heavy but also not light, more like an in between. Even the back looked like it was probably being used? Nothing was damaged. I cleaned the switch down and looks brand new overall. There was only one booklet inside too. Don't know if that's normal or not, the switch itself booted up as if it were new. But I guess I wanted to ask if this is normal in any way? I bought this brand new so seeing the tablet the way it was had me wondering if it's normal for the employees to even be opening the box. Should I be worried? No chance this is used or refurbished? Even after cleaning it as thoroughly as possible I'm still kinda nervous about it because germs lol appreciate any answers.",7,1585371509,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqdpx7/question_about_the_original_packaging_on_a_brand/,NintendoSwitch,1

fqdk4a,UPSIDFLINTMOBILE,Joycon drift-fixed with alternative method. The spring inside the joystick assembly may be too weak.,"I have reason to belive the drifting problem could possibly be due to the spring inside the joystick assembly being too loose. If the circuitry is sensitive enough and the spring loose enough the drifting could possibly be triggered by releasing the stick at one end point, or perhaps just gravity and the weight of the nub moving around. This could be made worse by oxidation which could explain why attempting to clean them only temporarily fixes it.

I dont mean to insult anyones intelligence and we should definitely listen to the experts but sometimes they can get things wrong. Someone with an EE degree breaks out a multimeter, lays down a solid case, everyone everywhere takes it as gospel of truth and issue never truly gets fixed because of that. Understandably, most people are not experts or experienced enough to figure it out on their own. 

Im just trying to figure the issue out for myself, since its super annoying both my sets of joycons drift, one with a new joystick, and its never quite made sense to me that its caused by the wipers scratching the pads...I brought a supposedly new set from walmart, took only the joystick module out since i have aftermarket joycon shells, popped it in, and the left side started drifting almost immediately. The first joystick i tore apart(and ruined) had VERY little, if any, wear on the pads. I keep seeing reports that repaired by Nintendo joycons immediately start drifting or at some point soon after. What Nintendo is doing internally with the joycons is not new, just on a smaller scale than most. I understand the logic behind it, though. When i first got into tinkering and electronics, I got a pretty sweet stereo that someone was throwing out. The problem? Wear and oxidation/gunk of the wipers for the volume and eq sliders causing static because of a bad connection. Those work basically the same way as whats inside the joysticks. Usually you would just have to exercise them back and forth.

I had bought good job! last night, and made it to the level where you have to sort the containers with a gantry crane and the amount of drifting made it impossible to keep it still long enough to grab anything. Before i decided to tear the joycon apart i was playing around with flicking the sticks pondering WTF and while doing so i tried to use my thumb and index finger to create kind of an end stop at the center point of the sticks on both x and y, and when i would flick the stick and let it go, when my fingers are resting there, the drift seemed to almost disappear. That was all i needed so I said screw it im going to risk destroying another left joycon to see if i can fix it. 

Took about 1hr to disassemble, stretch the spring and get everything put back together. Word of warning though its a bit difficult to do and not damage anything. I ended up breaking three of the large tabs holding the back cover on when i tried to bend them back. Also the x/y contacts are very very small and easy to bend if youre not careful. I will likely end up 3d printing a jig that i can screw the joystick down to so its a little easier, and hopefully fix my other drifter. I made a point to only try to stretch the spring and did not clean the pads. I actually dropped the pad and was fumbling around with it for a few, while trying to get everything back tongether. I seriously doubt any fingerprints or whatever else i accidentally did would have fixed the level of drift i was having. Ive also had the joysons apart numerous times swapping shells and never had it just stop drifting.

Also, I didnt inspect the internal assembly too closely but it looks like maybe the spring, along with centering the stick, kind of helps hold the internal bits together and keeps the play out of the contacts and the pad. Perhaps simply a design flaw that cant be fixed easily. Could be possible that increased pressure from the spring could cause wear elsewhere over time I doubt it will amount to much but we will see.

I'm sure a lot of us have had joysticks that get loose over time. Anybody remember the N64 center stick after a good amount of usage? Those things got real loose. I can remember ps2 sticks getting real loose as well. It may have been third party but i seem to recall an extreme case where one of them drifted in a similar fashion to the joycons.

I'm willing to admit that i may very well be wrong on this and time will tell but, for now its working. I suppose it's possible that its just fixing a symptom of another problem but Its so nice to not have it drifting all over the damn place.

Sorry that got a little long winded.

So yeah, I did a quick search and saw that at least one person here has suggested the spring possibly being the culprit but not seeing much else.

Anyone willing to test this maybe we can figure out a way to get around the issue?

Tldr: Guy, tired of joycon drift, tears apart joycon, possibly discovers a solution to the real problem. Loose centering spring.",4,1585370788,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqdk4a/joycon_driftfixed_with_alternative_method_the/,NintendoSwitch,1

While these two games works perfectly fine alone, games like Splatoon and Animal crossing would really benefit from a slightly more open online, at least for me ofc.

I think the majority of us already knows the switch limitations and have dealt with it, so i don't want to start a useless rant.  Instead i ask you, what do you do to circumvent its close online nature? Do you drag relatives and friends to your hobbies?  Really curious of your answers.

fqcv1z,MiserableRide,Animal Crossing got boring faster than I thought.,"Yes, I am well aware that Animal Crossing games aren’t conventional. You don’t beat it, you can’t binge it. You do whatever you want, at your own pace. What content the game has is spoonfed a little at a time everyday. I really want to get why people love this game like, a lot. I do understand to an extent. After about a week of playing it, my desire to return to it has dropped exponentially. 

Maybe it’s because the gameplay loop is too simple for me. Maybe it’s because I’m not a perfectionist; once my island looks not too bad, I don’t really care too much anymore. I don’t care about perfecting every little detail. 

And I know the response to this is “In AC you make your own fun” but the fun you make I feel is... lacklustre. I mean, decorate, farm, talk to some villagers, see what’s new and that’s it. Yes, I know it’s not a game you spend hours playing but even just playing it for an half-an-hour there’s not much to discover anymore once I hit a certain point. Rare fish/bugs are way too rare. And I have the feeling once I get to a new season that “OMG I need to donate all the things” feeling will come back but will soon dissipate. Fishing is not fun when 99.9% of everything is the same crap. 

I feel like if I was depressed, or feeling lonely, this game would be perfect. It feels a certain void for a lot of people and I get it. But as someone who is neither, I don’t find any special connection to any character. They’re cute though. 

If you’re super into customizing this game is a dream.

fqbf0w,avacadobagel,Returning the Switch Lite for Original Switch,"Hey everyone! 

I want to apologize in advance for my post as I'm really new to everything and I probably have a very simple question, but I would appreciate all the help I can get! 

I bought a Nintendo Switch Lite a couple of days ago from Wal-Mart and made a Nintendo Switch Online account and downloaded Animal Crossing on it. This is my first ever Nintendo console, and I opted for this over the original switch purely for price. 

After playing for a couple of days and browsing the games available, I think the original switch would suit me better as I kept thinking how much fun it would be to be able to play with my friends as I was browsing the games. Therefore, I would use the multiplayer function quite a bit on the original switch. 

My question is if I were to return the switch lite back to Walmart, how do I reset it back to default settings (ie remove my information on there)? As well, once I order an original switch (which probably won't be anytime soon since they're sold out everywhere!), would I be able to re-download Animal Crossing and my progress thus far through the Nintendo Switch Online account? I really would hate to pay another $80 for it :( 

Sorry again for the seemingly mundane questions, but thank you in advance!",3,1585362042,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fqbf0w/returning_the_switch_lite_for_original_switch/,NintendoSwitch,1

So I preordered the game, limited Edition Switch and carry case from Target for my wife's birthday, which is a few days before release of the game. She's a huge fan and I thought the notebook that came with it was pretty cool. I made this order 31 January, two days after preorder opened.

I received the Switch and carry case on time. Just waiting for the game to release.

21 March, the day after release. I got a notice saying our order was on backorder. That's fine, seeing the current situation. I just figured their logistics was backed up a bit. I could wait.

23 March: Got notification that our shipment wouldn't be until 3 April. I was annoyed with that a bit since it was two weeks after a game I preordered two months ago released, but again, with the current situation I just rolled with it.

26 March: Got a notification that a shipping label had been created. Yay. I checked on the order, and it only showed the game being delivered. I looked around a bit, couldn't find anything about the notebook. I emailed customer service and asked if I was being shipped with it.

27 March: Received a message from customer service. ""We ran out of the notebooks and are unable to fulfill your  order. Have a great weekend."" I messaged them back asking wtf, and they ended up giving me a $20 gift card.

As always,"So my left joycon has been having drift issues for months, but I couldn't send it off due to not having a back-up controller and money being too tight to buy a cheap one. My fiance recently got a second job and we got caught up and he surprised me with a controller one morning. Finally I could send off my joycon to have it fixed! At this point the joycon is literally unusable due to the drift so I was pretty hyped. I filled out a form and waited... Wellll after a little over a week I get an email back stating their repair services have been closed down due to Covid-19 and that I'll be getting an email once they're open again.

So now I can't use my switch unless its docked and on days when my back injury acts up I'm stuck in bed with only my phone. I'm glad they're being smart and protecting their workers, I'm just really bummed out about how terrible timing everything has been.

What can I do?","So about a year and a half ago, I hacked Splatoon 2 by unfairly giving myself a very suspicious amount of coins, clothes, shoes, etc. No crazy out of this world hacks like winning every game I played or anything remotely like that. I was eventually greeted with the error code in the title a few weeks after I started hacking. I knew I was banned, so I created a new profile. I was still banned online. Ok... I'll delete the account that I was hacking on, is that enough...? Nope, and I had $100 worth of games on the account I had hacked on so I basically just flushed $100 down the toilet. Ok, I'll just wait out this ban for a year and see if I'm still banned... had my switch gather dust, didn't even touch my switch cause I only really loved Splatoon 2, but then I saw my switch online session was expired so i couldn't play online... or at least see if I was still banned. So I waited again just to be safe and just today I bought switch online for $21 AND Animal Crossing New Horizons for $65 only to see...

I'm still banned o-o

and now I'm reading posts saying I have to buy a NEW switch so I would have to buy ACNH and switch online again

**If I called nintendo (if I waited long enough to get someone even on the phone), would it be possible for them to unban me? Can I unban myself without wiping my system?**

fq8lru,Yorah,PSA/Guide for Those Looking to Buy a Switch Right Now + Favorite Game Question,"I just purchased a switch today after contemplating it four times a year for the last two years and I'm really excited for it to come in! I've seen quite a few posts about the limited stock of the switch (this is true but it's still possible to get one!) so I figured I would share what worked for me. 

1) Figure out which switch you want. (blue/red joy cons or gray joy cons, etc.)
2) Go to the [zoolert website](https://www.zoolert.com/videogames/consoles/nintendo/switch/) and click the ""Alarm: On"" button (you can choose and test your sound by clicking on of the ""Sound"" buttons)
3) Leave the website up while you work from home, play video games, etc. and wait until you hear your chosen sound.
4) When you hear the chosen sound, drop everything you're doing and click on the listing that has the new green ""In Stock"" text (the Product Title text is a link).
5) Return to step three if you do not get the switch fast enough (it took me multiple days of trying).

**Notes on zoolerts**
* This website seems to update faster than nowinstock and others I tried.
* This site claims to update every minute.
* BHPhotoVideo has a ""Blue-Red Joy Con and Super Mario Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe"" that seems to come in stock a few times a day. This does **not** contain the newer version of the switch with updated battery life if that is what you are looking for.
* If you are looking for the Animal Crossing Edition Switch, good luck. I've only seen one appear in stock in the past few days.
* The sound will sometimes continue for a couple minutes after a switch has been purchased, it takes a few minutes to register the purchase.
* Best Buy, GameStop, and Amazon (in that order) seem to be the suppliers to get new stock most frequently. I ordered my switch from Best Buy.
* Be patient but diligent. People are buying these things as soon as they come in stock. You have to be quick and get lucky.

Now that I have a switch coming to my door next week, I'm constantly looking at game reviews and trailers to see what I should buy. As of now, I'm most likely going to buy Animal Crossing and Mario Kart 8 to start (I'm sure I'll get BoTW eventually). **What is your favorite switch game and why should I buy it?**

Good luck everyone! I've heard it is worth the wait!

TLDR: go to the [zoolert website](https://www.zoolert.com/videogames/consoles/nintendo/switch/), wait, and then fervently type in your credit card number when given the chance to buy a switch.",13,1585352052,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq8lru/psaguide_for_those_looking_to_buy_a_switch_right/,NintendoSwitch,1

If person B is in a lobby I am unable to join that lobby and if I (person A) am in a lobby, then person B cannot join regardless of who creates the lobby.  When I attempt to join a lobby with person B in the lobby I get the error code ""2618-0513"" and it says I am unable to connect to the other console. 

Before following all of Nintendo's troubleshooting options for the error code above,  I had a NAT type B with a download speed of 13.5 Mbps and an upload speed of 7.6 Mbps. After troubleshooting I maintained a NAT type of B, but my download speed rose to 34.2 and my upload dropped to 5.4. After troubleshooting the problem still persisted and neither person B nor myself are able to play with each other.

The only way we've been able to bypass this issue is for one of us to turn on a mobile hotspot from our phone and connect the switch to the internet via the hotspot rather than the router.

fq671b,surlydancing,Bravely Default II demo: Compiling feedback for the upcoming survey,"Shall we compile a list of potential improvements based on the demo? We don't know when the feedback survey is gonna go out, but when it does, I want to have a ready resource. Otherwise I'm gonna forget lots of it - or worse, remember a distorted version in which the best or worst parts get magnified.



What I think is really important is that this feedback be phrased in a neutral format that emphasises *what* it is that could be improved. As opposed to 'Dear Diary' reviews detailing peoples’ emotional responses about why *this* is perfect and *that* is utter garbage and *this* is a complete disappointment and *that* is the greatest thing ever. Basically, I want it to sound almost like a list of patch notes. This will make for useful and constructive criticism, in which the developers won't need to extricate the meat from the fluff. 



I have a preliminary list. Please suggest more!



**Overworld**



- Add several levels of camera zoom to toggle between, including more zoomed-in option(s) than the one in the demo. 
- Increase the range and speed of the A button sword attack.
- Reduce overworld enemies’ sight range. 
- Allow overworld enemy spawn rate to be adjusted, akin to the encounter rate adjustments of previous games.
- Include a method (whether it’s a key item or a menu) to view the full area map. 
- Lengthen the day-night cycle (assuming it hasn’t been shortened for the demo).



**Menus**


- Allow the weapon change animation to be skipped when moving between characters in the equipment menu. 
- Allow another character’s equipped items to be swapped to the chosen character (with a prompt) rather than having to manually remove it from the other character in order to equip it. 
- Include an ‘All’ option alongside the sorted-by-job submenus in the ability menu.
- Implement a Bestiary (if it isn’t already present in the full game).
- Change the (+) button function for viewing skill details to a toggle rather than a press-and-hold. 
- In shops, show equipment stat modifiers in a listed format rather than a text description. Possibly change to the ‘shop for a specific character’ format and use a similar layout to the equipment screen.



**Battle**


- Allow the pre-battle animation for both characters and enemies to be skipped, or have it be affected by the battle speed selection.
- Implement a visible turn order tracker.
- Show basic enemy information (status conditions, buffs/debuffs, BP) over the enemy’s head (rather than having to open the Battle Information screen). 
- Alternatively, show a list of enemies in the top left corner of the screen, akin to the one for the party in the bottom right, and display this basic information on that.
- Use the abovementioned lists to scroll up/down when choosing targets, which is more visually intuitive than scrolling left/right through the actual models.
- Improve the visibility of the character/enemy targeting indicator and include a similar indicator on the abovementioned lists.
- Change the (+) button function for viewing the Battle Information screen to a toggle rather than a press-and-hold.
- Implement a confirmation prompt before ending a character’s turn. 
- In tandem with the above (so as to not accidentally end a turn with a careless button press), map Default to the L button. 
- When holding A to speed through a character’s actions, implement a stop before the next character’s turn. 
- Permit multi-selection of the same move when using Brave (as in Bravely Second). 



**Game Balance**



- Extend the timers on buffs/debuffs/statuses. 
- Increase the impact of the ‘Chance to be targeted’ stat.",97,1585344445,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq671b/bravely_default_ii_demo_compiling_feedback_for/,NintendoSwitch,1

I bought 2 vouchers last year and was always planning to use one for AC:NH. A few days before AC:NH was released, I downloaded the demo for DQB2 and am really enjoying it.

I've never played games from either series before, but I have played Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp (free Android app) for a bit. It was fun but felt a bit repetitive and a bit limited in terms of what you could do.

So, my dilemma is...after watching several AC:NH reviews and videos, I can't help but feel it's very similar to DQB2 in terms of gameplay. You pretty much harvest and build based in your creativity—correct?

For those of you who have played both games, which would you recommend? Or, do you feel they're different enough for me to get both? I am trying to avoid ending up with 2 games that are too similar in experience.

I've been feeling pretty down during this quarantine business and I think Animal Crossing would definitely calm me down and give me some ""social interaction"" that I need.
I don't have a Switch and it is a large monetary investment for someone without much spending money.
I was considering buying myself a Switch and a copy of Animal Crossing until this quarantine stuff is handled and then selling the console+game once I'm back to work. Is that likely to happen? Are/will people be buying used Switches much (mine will be in perfect condition), and how much of a price drop would be expected?

My wife and I have been enjoying AC:NH since release, however yesterday we experienced a strange issue when my wife was playing online with her friends. I've previously played several games online extensively with no issue up until yesterday. 

Basically she was suddenly kicked off of online play, our switch was suddenly not connected to our wifi, and was unable to connect afterwords. 

We're given the error message 2110-3128 when trying to reconnect. 

The strange thing is it is JUST the switch, our computers, phones, etc. work just fine with the wifi.

I logged into our router and can see the switch still “connected” but the router can’t seem to actually connect the switch to the wifi. It fixed it self once yesterday after several hours, but hasn’t resolved itself over the night like we’d hoped.

We also noticed that the loading screen on AC were taking exceptionally long after we were kicked off. I deleted the software from the switch and eventually it was able to reconnect, but I don't know if those two actions were connected.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Could it possibly be due to the update yesterday? Is my router blacklisting my Switch?

Just got the Switch lite this week started playing Pokémon sword. Successful in downloading it.

Since then I have massive connection issues with it. It loses connection any few minutes. Best case scenario is having connection for 30 min max.

I tried troubleshooting online and did. the following:

Restarted switch several times 

Restarted router (fritzbox 7490)

Changed MTU from 1400 to 1500

Changed DNS to manually as is told on nintendo troubleshoot (primary 8.8.8.8 secondary 8.8.4.4)

Changed from 2.4 MHz to 5 and back again

Sitting directly next to the router 

Every other device works just fine (PS4/PC/Phone) 

I just have no idea what else to try maybe someone might be able to help me

Router and switch are up to date so no updating needed.

fq4h97,Jbaquero,Joycons repeatedly have input lag or stop responding to Switch (even brand new Joycons),"I've had my switch for two years and have played Smash Ultimate on it since it came out. After a couple of months, my Joycons started experiencing Joycon drift and would sometimes not do what I told them to do. So I bought new Joycons. 

The new Joycons worked fine (no drift) but again after a month or so, they would sometimes have severe input delay or just not do what I told it to do. Whenever I noticed that happening, I would have to stop playing that day and it was usually fine the next day. 

It got really bad recently so I bought a third pair of Joycons. Today was my first day playing with them and it started happening again. 

Here are some more facts:

* I have never dropped my Switch or Joycons 

* I play with the Joycons disconnected from the console (usually docked) and never more than 5 feet away from the screen. It still happens when I play 6 inches away from the screen

* The places I play at have very strong internet connections (although this happens even when I don't play online). 

* Problem happens even if I switch to a different TV to play on

I believe it's a bluetooth/connection problem with the Switch itself but am not sure what to do now or where to go to get it repaired. Any help would be appreciated",15,1585339419,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq4h97/joycons_repeatedly_have_input_lag_or_stop/,NintendoSwitch,1

A few days later he texts me and tells me that he can't start any software that used to work while my account was on his Switch.

I've looked around online and haven't seen anything about one Switch ""losing games"" after a user transfer, and even games \*he\* had previously bought through the eshop are inaccessible. He can only start a small handful of games, and it feels like I essentially stole them from him when I moved, which doesn't make a ton of sense. Makes no sense at all for the games that should be his, in theory.

For example, we purchased Pokemon Shield under \*my\* eshop account, and when the transfer happened, he can't start the software anymore. I had the theory that, because Shield was bought under my account, and now my account is unlinked, he can't play it. Sucks, but it makes sense. What throws me off is that, \*his\* account was used to buy the Expansion Pass not too long ago, and while he has it in his purchase history, I now have the option to buy it back on my in-game menu. So he somehow bought DLC for a game he ""doesn't own"" anymore?

A different issue popped up when trying to load Battle Chef Brigade, a game we both know for sure was purchased under \*his\* account. He can't play it either, but I can. I even deleted the software from my Switch and asked him to boot it up and check, but every game he ""used"" to own now only has a Proceed to Purchase option on the eshop. 

I just moved several states away and accidentally robbed my little brother, how do I go about getting his library back?

fq2ky8,ab00neideere,Expected More SNES/N64 Content,"Hey Community!

I bought my switch a few years ago with the hope that Nintendo would follow up on my favorite titles throughout the years. I'm a mid-30s former gamer whose last console was PS2 (played some PC games through the years &amp; always said yes to gaming on friends consoles). I had hoped and wrongly expected re-makes or at least re-releases of classic titles from Pilotwings to Golden Eye, Perfect Dark, Star Fox, Wii Sports, Diddy Kong Racing, Super Metroid, and fill in the blank for the many amazing SNES/N64 titles out there. I understand emulators aren't just a click of a button easy, but paying for Nintendo Switch Online and only receiving NES access is frustrating. I bought this console with the hope and expectation they would make up for the lack of processing power with more access to the worlds we grew up exploring. Are there enough people out there who feel similar? Enough to generate some momentum to encourage development? Or should I just lay my nostalgia to rest and be happy with an incredible portable console and a decent docked system.

Sometimes I have to bring the Switch all the way across the house to the router to get it to connect, but it will stay connected once brought back to my room. Once it is connected, it is totally fine. However every time it is put into sleep mode it disconnects again and I have to repeat the process again.

This made me realize many of us aren't really taking into consideration that this was a *""mini""* Direct, as in not the full-fat one we were hoping to get. Once you factor that in, the takeaway is much more positive: Nintendo *knows* its big guns, and is saving them for the right time. All those games we didn't get to see yesterday *will* be popping up throughout the year (faux E3 Direct likely), and when they do... I'm sure we'll be talking about them for weeks.

Never got far in any DQ game.

Zelda is by far my favourite series but I finished the game on 3DS Virtual Console not too long ago and I heard it is mostly a 1:1 remake.

The only I properly played before was Awakening and while it was good, it didn't really wow me.

That said, I have this issue regardless of every troubleshooting step I can think of - I own both my router and modem and have full access to them. My router is a Nighthawk XR300, my modem is a Surfboard SB8200 and I have cable internet. I've tried port forwarding, UPnP, wireless and wired connection (I bought a wired adapter for the Switch), DMZ, and even a direct connection to the modem via ethernet (special note here - my modem is NOT a combination product, it's only a modem). I've also got access to an Arris DG2470 combination modem/router which has the same issue. I've also tried and failed to resolve it by using a different router (Asus RT AX56U). I'm running the default / manufacturer provided firmware for all my devices, updated to the latest versions.

Has anyone had anything like this problem before?

I called my ISP and they say there shouldn't be any issue on their end. I do live in an apartment, but I don't get my internet via a package deal or shared source - the cable connection comes directly into my apartment.

For the record, I have 2 Nintendo Switch's, both the latest model, and both have this issue. I've also tried with only one Switch on each of these networking configurations (my second Switch is a recent purchase, and I've been trying to resolve this NAT issue on and off for months).

fq16ri,DerChrizzIX,Nintendo has to do something concerning incomplete game releases,"As a lot of people I was really hyped about the 2K games coming to Nintendo Switch, but the hype died immediatly after I saw those pesky ""download required"" notes on the game covers. At first I was like ""yeah that was expected, at least we're getting the first Borderlands game and the first Bioshock game on the game cartridge"" but oh boy I was wrong.

Bioshock comes on a 16GB card, that contains only the first chapter of each game, so you're actually only owning a demo of each game, which is awful for game preservation on one hand and results in a 31GB download on the other. But in my opinion the worst offender is Borderlands. The first game is around 14GB so they could have at least fit it on the cartridge, but instead of using a 16GB cartridge as they've done with Bioshock, they used a 8GB card which results in a mandatory 6GB download for Borderlands 1 and an extra 35GB download for the other two games.

This is inexcusable and Nintendo has to do something against that. There is NO way CDPR is able to afford releasing Witcher 3 on a 32GB card, while 2K seems to greedy to even use a 16GB card or to release all the games seperate. There is no other medium where this is acceptable, I don't get why everyone is okay with it. Nintendo has to step in an make it clear: release your game complete or don't. 

TL;DR: Nintendo should stop allowing lazy and greedy publishers like 2K from releasing incomplete games.",108,1585329840,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq16ri/nintendo_has_to_do_something_concerning/,NintendoSwitch,0

She is loving the game so much, that I ended up surprising her with her own Switch Lite and ACNH. I want to transfer her account/profile to her own Switch Lite, but now the question arises. Does doing so delete her House on my island? Does it ""delete"" the entire island completely, or will her house be there, just won't be playable because her account is gone from the original Switch.

She knows she will have to create a new save file/island on her own Switch Lite.

fq0mpx,Rainomon,Animal Crossing New Horizons is an unfinished game.,"Let me first say that I think this game is absolutely STUNNING!! It's extremely enjoyable and I've been hyping it like crazy. I love it. However, I do have to point out that the game feels very unfinished which is pretty frustrating considering there's a 7 year gape between New Leaf and New Horizons, but despite the latter being a newer game it has less content actually.

A LOT of improvement was made to animals, animations, multiplayer, etc - which is extremely important, but the game is definitely lacking. There's a lot of small things that made me realise  development was rushed:

* **Free Updates** \- self-explanotry; basic content such as holidays is missing from the game, but will be added later.
* **No bushes** \- Bushes on a tropical islands - makes sense, no? They appear by your house and in the museum, so why can't they be a standalone item/plant? The assets are already there.
* **Inconsistent touch controls** \- you can't use the touchscreen to draw designs (??).
* **No new personality types or species** \- there is definitely room for more personality diversity in this game, and it's upsetting that new species were not added as new ones would appear in each release.
* **Hourly music is very similar** \- Not the track that plays in the first few days, but hourly music that is unlocked later. I actually thought it was 3 different tracks, each for morning, noon and night. They sound extremely similar. It almost feels to me as though the hourly music for this game was produced all in one sitting.
* **Same items with different colours** \- I noticed you can buy items that have the same designs, but in different colors. To me it seems intentional so that players feel as though there is a lot of items for them to collect (but it's just different colors).
   * You **CAN'T** customize some of the items with multiple color versions in this game:  I got this Espresso machine that I encountered in 3 different colors as I played, but I could not change the colors myself even though there is a customization feature for that. It makes no sense. This further proves the main point.
* **Not a whole lot of recipes, furniture or clothes in general** \- I feel like there just isn't enough content compared to previous games, and to me this feels very intentional because paid DLC is definitely a possibility (like for any other Nintendo IP released so far).

All in all, a bit frustrating. Especially because we had to wait 7 years for this game (few of which were invested in making money from Pocket Camp) and it feels like there just isn't much in it. Gameplay wise - it's amazing, but when it comes to all the other content it's quite lacking.

What is your opinion of the matter? Do you think the current amount of content suffices, or did you have higher expectations?",44,1585328218,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq0mpx/animal_crossing_new_horizons_is_an_unfinished_game/,NintendoSwitch,0

fq0cx0,ThemeParkFan2020,Jeffrey Grubb: Nintendo to rely on HD remasters more than ever before in 2020,"This is the guy who leaked the Indie World and Mini Directs, so this is more believable than the usual rumor. From the Resetera Direct Speculation Thread.

""The reason I said it wasn't a mini is because of the games I thought Nintendo was showing up with. I don't know why Nintendo is holding back on its 2020 lineup, but my guess is the same as everyone else's: playing it safe in an uncertain environment due to COVID-19.

My guess is that Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is the only other big release until the faux-E3, and then the other games I'm hearing about will follow quickly after that. The good news there is that it should be a pretty darn packed summer Direct as long as development doesn't get too disrupted.

**That said, I'm not trying to get your expectations sky high. I don't think this year is going to match 2017, and Nintendo is going to continue relying on HD remasters -- but maybe in a bigger way that ever before**

This also lines up with an Emily Rogers tweet from a few days ago (although she has a mixed track record), where she said that this would be an ""INSANE year to play old games""",573,1585327422,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq0cx0/jeffrey_grubb_nintendo_to_rely_on_hd_remasters/,NintendoSwitch,4
fq0bes,Raliath,Docked USB sound output for Arctis 7 headset,"I recently purchased a SteelSeries Arctis 7 for PC gaming and one of the features I like about it is the audo pass through on the wireless transmitter. 

For those of you unfamilliar with the product, the transmitter connects to my PC via USB, and has a line in and a line out (3.5mm). I plug my speakers into the line out, which means that when I turn the headphones on, audio is automatically redirected to the headphones and visa versa. It's a neat little features that saves me having to select audio decices in windows each time I put my headset on. 

Now since I play my Switch in docked mode most of the time, I have it connected to the same monitor I use for my PC. Now it is possible to connect the Switch to the transmitter's line in via the 3.5mm jack, and enjoy the same convinience of audio device swapping. 

In the interest of cable management though, I was wondering if I would be able to utilise the USB plugs on the dock with [something like this.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charge-Player-recorder-Speakers-3-2Feet/dp/B07F6BP65Y/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=usb+to+3.5mm&amp;qid=1585327125&amp;sr=8-5) I'm aware that the Switch supports USB audio output for some headsets, but I was wondering if any of you wizards would be able to confirm this idea would work before I go buying a cable.

fq05xd,under_a_brontosaurus,AC Sound Design for Handheld,"There's a lot of things Animal Crossing does right.  One of the more revolutionary things it does right is the sound design for handheld.  The music is sparse and relaxing.  The sound effects are pavlovian and clear.  The instruments are really clever and fun.  

I am often playing the game with something else going on, like I am now procrastinating doing some work on my PC, but Animal Crossing is still running.  And there's some slight wind and crashing waves sound effects.  It is nice, and I know nothing crazy is gonna happen while I ignore the game.  Most games I would have to mute altogether or at least the sound effects while I multi-task.  But for a game designed perfectly for handheld, the sound is tailor-fit.  I hope other game designers take note at how well it is done.

Oh and the music and ambient tracks seem to sound great at low volume and higher volumes.  I don't find that to be the case playing most games in handheld.",5,1585326865,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fq05xd/ac_sound_design_for_handheld/,NintendoSwitch,1

I’m also a FIFA career mode fan and I was thinking maybe I could also get him into that as well. What do you all think? Is this something that would be realistic for him?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",6,1585322406,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpypp6/a_switch_for_my_father/,NintendoSwitch,2

Not only can you add a game that you own, but you also have a wishlist and a sale watch list, where you can get notified when a game goes on sale.

fpx7xh,Nyaran,Please Note before buying Jedi Academy or other Aspyr titles,"According to Aspyr, you cannot create or host online multiplayer matches. 

-For the Nintendo Switch Version, it seems you also cannot invite your friends into matchmaking with you.

-Aspect Ratio is not great on HD TVs and cannot be changed.

-Game performance is mediocre and load times are worse than the pc version it is based on, even after being bloated with mods.

-Has the same audio glitches as the PC version, including stuttering when opening certain menus whole music is playing.


They have created another incredibly low effort port by seemingly stripping down a PC version to the barest acceptable minimum.

They also admit that Star Wars Episode 1 Racer will only have local multiplayer and LAN support on Switch.

This is despite them hyping up online multiplayer, and then not being up front about ANY of this.

When reached out to, they refuse to answer questions.


Please consider these business practices heavily before supporting Aspyr by buying these titles.

At first i assumed just dusty sticks, but that didnt fix it. I also tried just re-syncing the joycon, no fix. It's strange to me that both controllers are ""broken"" in the exact same way which leads me to think it's more of a problem with the console itsself than the controllers.

Any advice before I go through Nintendo's returns? I'm off warranty so trying to avoid spending money on this...

Thanks!",8,1585313344,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpwcyq/joysticks_drifting_on_both_original_joycon_and/,NintendoSwitch,1

fpumdi,sephirothxxl,Switch or 2 ds xl.. switch only good for ports ?,"Hi there I am considering buying a handheld console and i was thinking about the switch at first, but doing more research and seeing through the different rating sites / top game videos on youtube, I do notice an overwhelmingly high rate of ported games, with a considerably higher price point compared my other systems.

I do own a potent pc and an xbox one with gamepass. I wasnt looking for buying a console to play those games I have or am able to play anyways. Actually, I wanted a state-of-the-art handheld which

So now I am kind of indecisive, wheter it be a switch or, if at all maybe a ds. I read through multiple forums and that a ds may be dead but it has a stellar library of games, even though they are rather ""easy-going"" games, compared to the games / ports on a switch.

An then there is the idea a normal switch maybe too big for mobile gaming. oh well, why didnt they bring out a switch lite with true switch mode.

fpuhw8,Phenom_Mv3,Potential Newcomer to the Animal Crossing Series - on the fence questions,"So I’ve owned every Nintendo console and handheld since the SNES, and love all the Nintendo first party series games. But never had the chance to check into Animal Crossing. 

My favourite Nintendo series are Zelda, Metroid and Mario. I love adventure games, going on quests etc.

Which makes me curious as to whether or not it will be a waste of money to buy AC in case it does not suit my tastes and/or align with my gaming habits.

I notice that New Horizons’ world is based on the real-time clock and calendar, and have heard word on the internet that to fully enjoy the experience, you should play a little bit everyday, check on your island/town etc.

 Is this true? Because I’m a gamer that only has the time to play twice a week at max, 30 minute sessions each. Will that hamper the experience at all? Or does that not matter?

Also, does it appeal to gamers who like that sense of achievement? That’s what draws me to story, adventure, RPG, where there are clear goals, rewards, linear paths etc. and not so much wandering around doing random things.

I love what I’m seeing in the trailers, but just wanted to get a feel from gamers in the community after a week of play to see what their thoughts are... Cheers!",11,1585304157,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpuhw8/potential_newcomer_to_the_animal_crossing_series/,NintendoSwitch,1

Nintendo wanted about $100 to “fix” it because I’m out of my warranty. 

Does anyone know if I could buy new joy con rails somewhere and if that would fix it or do I need to just buy a new switch?

fptm2i,StriveForMediocrity,"Jedi Academy review, after doing tutorial","I played the hell out of all the Dark Forces and Jedi Knight games, this one being my favorite. Favorite Star Wars game, for that matter. I beat it many times, both light and dark side, on every difficulty, and all 3 saber choices, plus loads of multiplayer. On Switch, ultimately I can’t recommend this game for a few reasons (I never played it on console before so keep that in mind, I think it was on Xbox):

It relies on your nostalgia to overlook the graphics, their being that telltale early 2000s polygonal style and level layout. Large textures, blocky models, wide open empty spaces, blunted character animations, etc.  If you haven’t played it before there are better Star Wars games and going back to early 3D-era is rough nowadays.

The AI is dumb and easily exploitable. Increased difficulty settings just makes mobs hit harder, and on the highest difficulty you just have half health on top. On the easiest setting the AI may just sit there sometimes, I don’t recall. This doesn’t bother me as I knew what to expect, but new people might be put off by this.

Controls are a little too imprecise for finer jumping puzzles, general navigation, and combat. They did implement motion controls, but if you’re playing this game you came for light sabers, and motion controls are pointless as you can’t swoop around to do a 180 like you need to in melee. Your saber aiming is more pointing towards a quadrant than precise, and you’ll be running and jumping and swirling all around. If you’re not using a saber your Jedi’ing wrong. The best part of Jedi Academy was that you started with the saber (you didn’t in previous games). You can throw right off the bat too, so why go back to a blaster? That’s what the other games were for, pre-saber.

$20 is way too much for a game that’s 15+ years old and largely unchanged. It’s Switch + Star Wars tax. It should have been $10 to coincide with Outcast’s price. “But it has multiplayer!” you immediately say. Outcast had multiplayer too, most of the files are intact on Switch, they just, didn’t turn it on. “But then people wouldn’t buy Outcast!” you follow up with. For $10, Star Wars, in a game with storyline continuity in the awesome EU, practically anyone who buys one will buy both. For $20, most people will just get Academy. Plus Outcast is rad too.

On PC, on GOG, it’s currently $3.49.

This was obvious right away after checking the menus, and the worst part for me. You can only have one force ability bound at a time. At the end of the game you’ll have a bunch of powers at your disposal you’ll need to juggle, and the absolute best part was being able to use multiple powers at once. My go-to for dark side is force choke, jump overhead and force pull to launch them straight up and they splat. Or, choke then drag them to an edge and push them over a cliff while still in choke, and you could sometimes pull this off with the buffer guys too. That’s not possible now, even with furious combinations of hot key presses as you only have one Activate Current Force Ability button. You might as well play light side which is all toggle abilities or one shots, but light side is for wieners, and you came for the rage + choking + lightning. Plus, the last level is a million times better playing as dark side.

I just can’t recommend this on Switch. I don’t know who this game caters to unless new folks can stomach the crappy graphics and don’t know any better, or old folks enjoy being frustrated by the interface. There was FPS stuttering too. I really wanted to like this. It’s my all time favorite Star Wars game, with OG Battlefront 2 being a close second. There you go.

TL;DR $3.49 on GOG, I mean seriously what the hell. Wait for a sale if you still really want it.",8,1585299110,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fptm2i/jedi_academy_review_after_doing_tutorial/,NintendoSwitch,1

I'm a little bit in and the story so far has piqued my interest, it has a lot of potential and I'm interested to see where it goes. 


However the switch version feels very unpolished. While I like gameplay so far it feels VERY clunky, to the point where it's putting me off playing. I feel like it was definitely made with PC in mind and the Switch port was a bit rushed. 


Going to stick with it for a bit but to be honest regardless of how good the game and story might be I think the controls are eventually going to be a deal breaker for me.",1,1585297823,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpte8d/thoughts_on_grand_guilds/,NintendoSwitch,1
fpta6i,K1ngB0o,After 2 years I am unable to play my favourite console.,"As the title would suggest I bought my switch around 2 years ago and since then I’ve barely touched my other consoles. I love the idea of a hybrid console and the handful of games I own for it are some of the best I’ve ever played (Breath of the wild is now my favourite game of all time).

But about a year ago my left joy-con began to stop working, I didn’t buy my switch from the official nintendo store and as a result I had left warranty period. In the UK there’s no guaranteed free repair like the US and I didn’t want to pay close to the full price of a joy-con to have mine sent in. My joy-cons no longer worked and I played purely on a pro controller.

Now the left stick of my pro controller doesn’t work and I can’t really use that. I have other controller options but it’s frustrating to be unable to play on either of the official controllers made my Nintendo. I’d still like to play on my switch but it feels wrong to me to keep supporting a company that sells what I would consider to be faulty hardware.

TL;DR : Both my main controllers have stopped working and I’ve lost interest in my switch as a result.",7,1585297158,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpta6i/after_2_years_i_am_unable_to_play_my_favourite/,NintendoSwitch,1

- **TONS of customization options, from emotes to the ""Ninja Gum"" to your ""Ippun!"" kill feed bumper, to your outfit!**

- **Looks to be heavily inspired by Splatoon in terms of design and appeal, but is more brawly and actiony. I REALLY dig the design of it.

So 4days ago was my birthday and my mom gave me a switch pro controller as a present. I noticed it was fake right at the moment i opened the wrap but i didn't tell her anything about that, i just used it. Surprisingly it doesn't bad at all, the plastic doesn't feel cheap, buttons feel good, the left joy stick feel abit off kinda unresponsive, motion sensor works. After using it for 2 days, i contacted a friend of mine to borrow the legit pro controller and compared them. The fake one can't scan amiibo cards ( i don't have any amiibo card so i also borrow that from my friend) and missing nintendo logos but other things feel the same. Even my friend can't tell any different between the 2 except for the unresponsive left joystick, that's quite surprise for a counterfeit which cost 19$

I'll buy a 2nd hand legit pro controller (pro controller is quite expensive to me)  later but i'll still keep this one just because it's a gift from my mom.

fps5kp,kkundlas1105,ARMS Smash rep Theories?,"So we are getting an ARMS rep in smash, and basically everything we thought about potential reps in the game have been thrown out the window. Assist Trophies, Spirits, and Mii costumes have all been repped by ARMS, and now we get a proper fighter. Whether this is a one-time deal, we don't know, but it's interesting nonetheless.

That said... who's it gonna be? With the mystery surrounding it, couple of major theories/ideas have popped up:

1. Spring Man: He's the icon of the series, makes sense to make him the rep. Probably will keep his assist trophy in as well, would be neat if Springtron came out instead if Spring Man is a fighter. Maybe put in Ribbon Girl as well as an alternate skin.

2. The Entire Roster: Bowser Jr and Inkling have alternate skins that represent the rest of their teams, and doing the same with the ARMS roster would be cool. Also think it's likely given the announcement deliberately showed the entire roster, Smash isn't one to purposefully instill ill will about choosing one fighter over another.

3. A new DLC fighter: Nintendo apparently are pushing to bring ARMS back in a big way, and a new fighter would be a neat way to stimulate that. Probably would get some pushback for being a blatant ad, but still.

4. ARMS 2 Protagonist: Its been 3 years, maybe a new game has been in development and they want to promote it through Smash. Unlikely, but a possibility.

I'm planning on buying New Horizons digitally and I'm wondering what the process will be like if I want to transfer the games between Switches.

I'm sure I can transfer my ownership of the game through my Nintendo account to a new Switch (and indefinitely to any amounts of new Switches I'm sure), but my island data wont be transferred right?

And if I buy a physical cart, wont I have two islands, one for the old Switch and one for the new Switch?",7,1585287236,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fprg3m/transfer_entire_save_data_for_new_horizons/,NintendoSwitch,1

I want to buy him a switch but I see them mostly sold out plus I’m not sure the best way to get it to Bangkok and have the right gear. 

So was hoping someone might know the best way to get him a Switch. I know it would go a long way for him and I’m willing to pay and all that (or find used).

fpqxzw,real_g0sub,About L.A. Noir and RollerCoasterTycoon Adventures?,"Hello guys, I think I want to buy these two games but before wasting money I wanna ask you if the games worth. I just have few questions that blocks me from buying them:

1) I never played LA Noire on any console, but I read it's a good game overall. Is the Switch port worth?

2) I read about the cartridge being 16GB and needed for Internet to download additional 14GB of data/fixes. Is this still going, or has it been released a 32GB cartridge? If yes, how can I spot which version am I going to buy?

3) Despite the 16/32GBversion of the game, do I still need a huge SD card for this game? (At the moment I'm running with a 4GB SD)

4) Now speaking of RCT Adventures, I am a huge fan of amusement parks and long time player of the whole RCT serie, specially RCT3 where I just sandbox and create crazy coasters or reproduce the existing ones in real life parks, and then enjoying the ride cam of course. Is this possible to do on RCTA or is it more like a mobile version of the game, like I don't know, a Theme Park Tycoon where I just drag and drop square pre-made rides and that's it? Because I literally DON'T want to play ""carreer"" or something like that. I want Sandbox mode, and being able to build my dream coaster without limits, with all the elements like loop, half loop, corkscrew, inline twist, immellman, cobra roll, batwing roll, etc. Also, I want to create every kind of coaster like Launched Coater, Dive Coaster, Flying Coaster, Wing Coaster, Inverted Coaster, Wooden Coaster, etc. Good game or bad mobile tycoon game that baits me with the franchise title?

I may have the answer for the 4) *(which is no, don't buy it)* but I still ask to you just to be sure, all points, you probably know better than me these details.

fpqlx7,Atmp,Saints Row IV,"I’ve been looking for a GTA style game on switch, and last year got Saints Row 3. It got panned for having terrible performance, and while it was bad at times (notably the opening scene, first 15 mins of the game were really bad), overall I found it playable and enjoyable... and got better with patches. 

Anyway I just got Saints Row 4 on switch. Surprised to not see much chatter about it. I’ve played for a couple of hours and honestly am floored at how much better it runs than 3, and this is coming from someone that found 3 enjoyable. 

The switch is my first time playing either of these and the plot for 4 seems nonsensical, opening sequence is ridiculous, but after that it’s been a blast. Runs GREAT on switch. If you were turned off by how 3 ran on switch, 4 runs wayyyy better. Don’t hesitate to check it out for a GTA fix! Hopefully you can find a copy if you are looking - seems to be in short supply.

I a play on my regular Switch, which is my primary switch, and play Animal Crossing digitally, and most other games physically. She only plays Animal Crossing on the switch lite digitally. Both are linked to the same Nintendo account. We quickly discovered that we cannot play Animal Crossing at the same time, which was to be expected, but we also discovered that we could not play any digital games at the same time. This included a demo I was trying, and a few other games I was playing. After that, I decided to play physical games, specifically Pokemon, and that worked. We were able to play the two systems at the same time for a while. However, after I tried to play Fire Emblem, it decided to kick her off. Now that our previous notions on what can and cannot be played at the same time have been proven wrong, I am now wondering there is something wrong with the systems, or if I am doing something wrong myself. So now I must ask, is there something wrong, am I doing something wrong, and how do I fix it?

fpp0a5,GraveyardGuardian,"$500+ in the last week, just due to AC release and Corona coinciding.","So... we have a Switch and a Switch Lite. One for the fam and one for my kid. We got AC and realized you have to share one island, so now we've purchased yet another Switch (not the Lite this time) and had trouble finding one at that. Then (I know I know, first world problems, especially now) we get another copy of AC because our first is Digital and we can't share it (at least not easily).


Look... I would gladly pay some sort of shared cost for multiple licenses or whatever Nintendo wants, but $500+ is a high barrier for entry to enable yourself, the SO and a kid to enjoy the game they want to play and also be able to play together in a more meaningful way.


I hope Nintendo uses our $500 to put more time and effort into tightening up the feel of their online offerings, saves and moving them between devices, and making things less convoluted/more user-friendly.


Have been a loyal fan of Nintendo since a cousin showed me this amazing thing called an NES that was like magic compared to the old Atari 2600 we'd been using since I was a year old (and before for my parents!).
Only thing I never owned was a Gamecube, and never got to play AC before. Was looking forward to it and now we've spent a week on it, scrapped our saves and are ready to start over once the actual console and another copy arrives at our doorstep. Just put a bad taste in our mouths and my wife was like ""F-it, you both just play, I'm done..."" and that's rare for her as an avid gamer.


Anyway, please don't take this as bashing, but more constructive criticism and maybe someone who cares who works at Nintendo might come across this and learn that fans want to spend money... they just don't want to feel cornered into doing so or hinder gameplay in some way to avoid it.",10,1585276273,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpp0a5/500_in_the_last_week_just_due_to_ac_release_and/,NintendoSwitch,1

No longer a warms screen, better battery life, does not get as hot as model 1 to the point it effected screen protectors,quitter in dock mode,  and slightly  lighter. So do we really need a switch pro? The switch is going to 4 years old at this point and I think fine being at model 2.

fpn9mv,Dagawing,"A quick ""First-Impression"" review of the game ""Good Job!"", revealed today on the Mini Direct","Heya! I saw the game Good Job on the Direct today (March 26th), and was instantly captivated, and I bought it on the spot. I saw in it a wacky, fun game like Overcooked, Human Fall Flat, and Untitled Goose Game.

I played a good 3 hours of it already (streamed it), I reached the end of level 3 out of 9.  Here's my first impression of it:

  
PROS

\+ The game is a puzzle game where you need to solve the objective of each level (Each floor has 3 levels + 1 hard ""boss"" level.

\+ Each level so far have been very unique, not only in the objectives, but in the way you navigate the terrain. Sometimes it's with a forklift, sometimes you use a crane, sometimes you drag a sofa around to collect a bunch of standing workers. It's great.

\+ The levels are richly designed, full of interactive items (every single thing you see is either grabbable, or destroyable). It is hilarious to fling a projector across multiple walls. 

\+ It's really fun trying to solve the puzzles of each level, as they have been very different so far. Sometimes the challenge isn't in finding out HOW to solve it, but how to do so efficiently. 

\+ Each level has 2 hats and 2 ""chestpieces"" to find. They are shimmering, and are often easy to find. Once again, sometimes you gotta think a bit in order to obtain the item.

CONS

\- Each level has a completion rating (A to D I think), based on 3 criteria: Time, Property Damage, and Items Broken. The con here (or maybe a plus?) is that it is far too easy to obtain top rank in every level. The game takes the highest of the 3, and gives you that score. I've often received a score of A, D and D, and ended up with A rank. 

The less property damage you do and the less items you break gives you a better score, but that doesn't matter when you can clear the level fast and get A anyway.

\- There's so much neat details in each of the levels, full of charm, but they don't serve a purpose other than appearance. Going on a massive destruction-spree in a level is fun the first few times... then it loses its' charm (some levels are an exception). I hope there's a New Game + kind of thing where you need to find hidden things in each of the maps.

\- Movement can be a bit wonky at times, but this is the minor-est of cons. It's not that bad. 

\- Jumping, so far, has been useless. :P 

&amp;#x200B;

I have yet to try co-op mode. I think that could be a real blast!

&amp;#x200B;

That's my ""first impressions"" review of the game. So far I'm really enjoying it! I wasn't sure what to expect going in, so when I saw the game was puzzle-centric, it took me a while to get my expectations in check. 

 It is currently 25$ (CDN) on the Eshop. I think it's worth it, if you enjoy silly puzzle games. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ask me anything about the game! I'll do my best to answer.",9,1585269463,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpn9mv/a_quick_firstimpression_review_of_the_game_good/,NintendoSwitch,1

fpmubp,Theprofessor1000,The font size in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is satisfyingly LARGE.,"As someone who cannot see very well at all, the Switch tablet is a godsend. I can’t put it  right in front of my face and finally see the game I’m playing. Playing in docked mode is not really an option for me. Even with my glasses, a game and its text are too blurry. 

Some games, though, are plagued by smaller text, and it’s a problem even in handheld. I’m thinking specifically of Fire Emblem Three Houses. That text is way too small. 

The release of AC:NH, tho, marks a new standard for large text which I hope other Switch games will adopt as well. It’s big. It’s bold. And it’s always readable. 

I shouldn't thank the AC developers for doing something that should be a given. But I really do appreciate it. The game is even more enjoyable because I can actually read the dialog. I hope more games follow suit.",455,1585267865,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpmubp/the_font_size_in_animal_crossing_new_horizons_is/,NintendoSwitch,1

Cleaned out the usb C port on the switch, tried hard resetting and doing the different order of plugging in cables and putting on the dock...

fpkj23,READlbetweenl,"While playing some Animal Crossing, I had a thought about how potentially awesome it'd be to have a Pokemon/Animal Crossing crossover game.","There's so many ways this could go. Some of my initial thoughts were - You could have the Pokemon be the various neighbors if you wanted it to be more A.C. than Pokemon. You could also catch Pokemon for them to inhabit your hometown.

There could be some really interesting mechanics within this. You could have Pokemon moves, types and abilities all play a role. Maybe a Pokemon with surf would let you access areas across water, much like the Pole vault does now. Maybe a ground type could make land higher or lower to access higher ground. 

Could also have mini sports play a role. A town could have a ""team"" built for your towns various sports. These teams could be used to go to other people's towns to compete. Pokemon types could have some sort of effect tied to their teams for various advantages. Example being a swim team with water Pokemon being better than some others in ways to give a slight advantage in that sport.

Town aesthetics could be dependent on the type of Pokemon in your town. Have a lot of fire Pokemon? Maybe that town would have a sort of volcano aesthetic. Ice types, snowy villages. Pretty sure you are where this idea is going.

Playing as a trainer or as a Pokemon (akin to the mystery dungeon games) could offer different, unique gameplay elements. Obviously playing a trainer would mean catching and battling Pokemon more traditionally where as of you're actually a Pokemon, building friendships and your hometown could depend on a plethora of elements.

I could go on and on!

fpk1gv,TheKober,Which next game to buy?,"Hey fellas.
I bought a Nintendo Switch a few weeks ago before the whole craziness started, and with it, I got the Zelda Breath of the Wild. A few days later I got Smash Brother Ultimate and I'm having a blast with them.

I want to get a new one, but I'm really in doubt on which game to buy next.

My wishlist is: 

Mario Odyssey 

Pokemon Sword

Mario Kart 8

Mario Maker 2 


The Switch is the first console I own since the PS2. Since then I've been exclusively playing on PC, and I got very happy to own again a Nintendo console. I have very fond memories of my childhood with my SNES.


Since on the PC, I have a very large array of games, and also they are considerably cheaper (or they get cheaper a lot faster) I can't simply buy all the games I want at once here. It is so weird how the Nintendo games prices seem to never get any lower. BotW was released three years ago, and its price is still the same.


I'm mainly focusing on the Switch exclusives for the console, since anything else I can probably play on the PC.


So, any help or opinions on which of the games I mentioned should be the best to buy next is appreciated.

fpjgvl,helthrax,Early thoughts on Panzer Dragoon Remake,"I'm an old school Panzer Dragoon fan, the original has some very fond memories for me, but the games that have seen the most play-time from me are Zwei and Saga. That out of the way I want to get straight to how this game fares.

So out of the bat I want to give this game some major credit for the amazing soundtrack. It lives up to the original and then some. I have the title screen music playing right now as I write this up and it gives me the major nostalgia feels and simultaneously wants me to dive into another playthrough. Second, the graphics are top notch and look fantastic for the most part, though they do get in the way, more on that later.

So I got to episode 4 during my first play through on normal and I want to talk about the gameplay, because there are some omissions I don't quite understand. While I understand they want to be faithful to the original, I do not know why they didn't have an auto-fire button for your pistol and another single press for lock-on. Zwei had an auto-fire way back in the day as part of it's pandora's box that was a special unlock, but not having these two separately mapped is frustration on my poor thumbs. The other aspect I do not like is threat indication, you are given a map up top that will show you where to expect enemies to come from, but this should have been expanded on in the remake to make it more apparent where to expect damage and enemies to appear, since enemies will fade into the background and make it more difficult to spot them.

Enemies seem to be more difficult to lock onto as well now, there have been times when I expected a lock-on and my reticle will harmlessly go over. In a game of split second decisions, not having your lock-on take effect is a big problem. It may not bother some, but the change of the lock-on sound also is annoying, since before it would fit with the background music. Now the sound is quite distinct and doesn't fit at all with the music. 

So the last thing I will touch on is a big game changer for me. The game has sped up in comparison to the original. While sometimes in the original you could end up soaking up the environments during particularly quiet moments, in general the entire game is faster now in the remake. It takes away from being able to absorb the environments, but most egregiously it makes responding to enemy attacks all the more difficult. There were times when an enemy would appear then fire, and I would have little time to react, much less shoot down their projectiles. This speed up makes it all the more difficult to respond to threats, be them enemies or attacks, and when this game relies on you being able to respond to threats in 360°, you can sometimes feel like you can't react in time. This was also a problem in the original, but with the original game speed you always felt like you did have some time to do this.

The last few things I want to bring up is an auto-front facing button, which would have helped a lot as well during orientation and particularly hairy dog-fights, and the overall break neck speed of episode 4 which ended up being the last part of my run. The loading times are a bit much as well, but that could easily be fixed in an update.

Overall I feel the game in it's attempt to be faithful didn't doesn't do enough to set itself apart from the original. It could have integrated some simple ways to improve the controls of the original, and make it more playable, especially improved threat detection. However the biggest issue for me is the speed of the game in general. It doesn't do the game any favors. However, I do feel that if you've been waiting a long time for a Panzer Dragoon, Star Fox, or even Sin &amp; Punishment, this game may just be what your looking for.",14,1585256100,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpjgvl/early_thoughts_on_panzer_dragoon_remake/,NintendoSwitch,1

fpjamp,adarkthread,Question about using 3 controls with Trine,"Hey,

I bought the game Trine and it says you can play with up to 3 people. I have two pairs of joycons, which I have split up into 4 small controls. Myself and 2 other friends are trying to play. When I choose ""multiplayer"" in the Trine game, the screen tells me that one control is automatically ready/connected and that the 2 other players need to press the plus sign to signal they are ready.

 I think the problem is that no matter how I set up my controls in the 'control' section of the home screen, the system keeps making one of the plus-sign controllers the ""boss"" controller. So that's the controller that Trine considers automatically ready. Which leaves one additional plus sign controller able to signal that it's ready and one controller that has a minus sign instead of a plus sign. Trine will apparently not accept pressing of the minus sign, or pressing of any other button, as an adequate signal of being ready. Any advice?  Or for this particular game do I need to have purchased a 3rd set? 

The minus sign controller is able to scroll up and down the menu options, so it's definitely connected and working, but simply can't signal it's ""ready"" in order to begin the game",5,1585255506,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpjamp/question_about_using_3_controls_with_trine/,NintendoSwitch,0

fpj5ry,ArmorOfGod7,Anybody else getting concerned about the lack of Nintendo games?,"The last two major Nintendo releases (developed or published by Nintendo) were Pokemon Sword/Shield on 11/15/19, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons on 3/20/20. At the moment, the only Nintendo game we know is coming this year is Xenoblade Chronicles, and that's just a port. We know they're working on Breath of the Wild 2 and Metroid Prime 4, but who knows when they'll actually release. 

I've been looking forward to a Direct since the end of last year when I realized Animal Crossing was the only thing on the Horizon (no pun intended). As January and February passed, I got more and more anxious. Then we started hearing rumors that one was coming in March, and I got really excited. Surely this was going to be the big one where they announce what big stuff they have in store for us this year! Nope, just a release date for a port, some DLC, and some 3rd party stuff. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with DLC or 3rd party, but my main interest is Nintendo games. What are they doing? I can only assume there will be a big Direct around E3 time and they'll announce some AAA Nintendo games. But, it's not like those games are going to drop immediately. At best, it will be late fall or holidays. So, Animal Crossing will be the only big Nintendo game to drop for an entire year. That's...pretty weak. That fact that I have no interest in Animal Crossing makes this even worse. 

There have been rumors that BotW2 could be coming this holiday, plus rumors that they're working on a new 3D Mario. If both of them dropped later this year, I'd be ecstatic and wouldn't mind this drought at all. But, that's incredibly unlikely.",82,1585255057,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpj5ry/anybody_else_getting_concerned_about_the_lack_of/,NintendoSwitch,0

Whereas the handsome collection was around 40GB and this switch release will also have Borderlands one and all of the DLC.

I wonder if these will be the remastered version or if they have just ported the 360 versions without the HD upgrades.  I don't mind the 360 versions, as long as they don't go overboard on the pricing - these should be around £30 a collection.",26,1585254764,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpj2kn/bioshock_and_borderlands_download_size/,NintendoSwitch,0

fpizy4,Mauruttius,Help with Animal Crossing save data?,"My fiance and I started with one switch and a digital copy of Animal Crossing that I bought with my Nintendo account so that she could start playing at midnight.

Anyways, instead of playing I ended up getting a second switch so that I could get my own island and we could play together that way. I didn't de-register my account as primary from the original switch so that she could keep playing.

Eventually we ended up getting a physical copy of Animal Crossing so that we could play via Local Play, but I was just wondering if her AC save data on the original switch would be affected if I deleted my nintendo account from her switch. I have NSO so I don't suspect that my data will be affected, but I don't want her to have to start her island all over again after having put in a bunch of effort.

I already deregistered my account as primary from hers so that I can play offline, but I worry that even with a cartridge she'll be restricted to having to play with an internet connection if I don't delete my account from her switch.

fpis5e,xolsiion,The second game for a budding five-year-old gamer after SMO,"We got a Switch for Christmas and my 5.5 year old has become enthralled with Mario Odyssey and getting to play a little bit most days.  However, I think he's beginning to approach the the point where I want to introduce him to the joys of getting a new game.

In SMO with ""Assist Mode"" turned on he's been able to largely progress through the entire game with minimal assistance (and lots of perseverance).  At this point he's just tooling around grabbing more power moons (or getting me to).  I'm trying to figure out which game might work best for him next.  He's not at the point of being able to read much but he's gotten better at hand/eye coordination for sure with Mario Odyssey as long as he can occasionally ""recharge"" his health.

SMO turned out to be the perfect game to introduce him to gaming but I lucked into it.  I'm a PC gamer and completely unfamiliar with consoles up until getting the Switch so I'm not sure if there are other things that might appeal to him.  I've tried to narrow it down a bit but are there particular ones below that jump out as horrible ideas for him?  Or other titles that I should be thinking about?  Any obvious next choice?

* Luigi's Mansion 3 - is he going to end up dying and restarting lots?  He loves to explore for sure and I read that the puzzles aren't too hard...

* Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe - I read that it's kid-friendly with the right characters?

* Super Mario Maker - very creative looking but I'm not sure he could actually play the prebuilt maps or the ones he creates himself?

* Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker - He's found this on youtube and it looks pretty SMO-like...

* Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games - read that the games are relatively easy to do?  Is it single-player or more like a family game?

* LEGO City Undercover - I thought the sandbox might appeal to him.

* LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 - Sandboxy?  He loves Spider-Man, especially Miles Morales' version.

* Sonic Forces - Too hard?


I also currently own:

* Breathe of the Wild - bit much for a five year old to learn

* Mariokart 8 - we play this together sometimes but he gets a little too frustrated with the competition and losing even with autopilot and auto-accelerate on to help (though he's roped me in to trying to get Golden Mario during ""Dad's screentime"" after bedtime)

* Mario Party - won't have until Easter and got for a family game night rather than for his personal screen time.",18,1585253812,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpis5e/the_second_game_for_a_budding_fiveyearold_gamer/,NintendoSwitch,1

fpip85,antarsan,Good Job - first impressions,"There were some questions about the game in this sub, so here we go:

\- the art style is great, the game runs smooth, there are no technical issues I've noticed

\- there seem to be 32 levels/puzzles. Not confirmed since I've not finished the game yet

\- it's much less of a youtube/streamer bait than it may seem. The puzzles are focused on figuring out how to solve them in the least destructive matter, rather then ""haha look at the physics, lol""

\- each puzzle is rated in three categories - time spend, number of broken things and the value of those broken things. Those combine to form the final rating for the puzzle. So far I've not seen any relevance to the ratings

\- each puzzle contains 4 cosmetic pieces of clothing

\- the game can be played co-op, up to 2 players local.

Overall I'm having fun with figuring out how to solve problems while not destroying literally everything in sight, however - there is a possiblity that the game will be short. Look out for reviews to see if it's worth the asking price. If it ever goes on sale - go for it, even if it ends up being as short as I think it will be. It's a fun little puzzler, perfectly suited for brief sessions.",22,1585253539,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpip85/good_job_first_impressions/,NintendoSwitch,6

i already tried everything nintendo suggested to do. i assigned a static IP to my switch, port forwarded all the ports to it, put it as a DMZ host, and even though i heard the switch doesn’t support UPNP, i enabled it anyways. nada. i even checked to see if i had at least one public IP (i do) and if my set up has double NAT (it doesn’t) and everything i did still gave me NAT F. when i use my hotspot, sometimes i’m able to connect to my friends but then the connection goes out after 20 seconds. 

is there anything left to do other than getting a new router/calling my ISP?",2,1585250119,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fphnyc/nat_type_f_on_my_switch/,NintendoSwitch,0

fph3aa,hah-no-thanks,[STORY] My boyfriend does not have a Switch. So his BEST friends helped me start up a foundation to get a Switch for him,"Just as the title says. Also, I do **not need donations** from you guys! This post is approved by the mods as long as I am not breaking Rule 6! 

**TL;DR** \- *My boyfriend’s friends donated in support of a Switch for my boyfriend that does not have one.* 

\---

My boyfriend does not have a Switch and most of his friends (mine as well) have Nintendo Switch. I felt bad for him because he is always left out especially with new games that came out just recently with Doom Eternal and ACNH.

I even begged him to let me buy a Switch in full price for him (for months...) but I often get my offer rejected by him. He insisted that he didn’t want it... I wanted to get him a Switch because I do not want him to get bored and I hope that his siblings can play as well. He already know how the Switch works because I made him take my Switch and play it for couple months since it was collecting dust...

Ever since ACNH and DOOM Eternal came out, my boyfriend isn’t able to join us and can only watch his friends play their new games via Discord. I didn't think that the pandemic is a big problem now and that I cannot hangout with him except on social media. He retells his friends’ silly moments in ACNH and sends memes to me. He isn’t familiar with Animal Crossing but he knows some villagers and how the game works.

I felt so bad for him honestly so I wanted to change that. I asked for help in providing donations for my boyfriend and I am already shocked by his friends. I almost cried but his friends are really his true friends. They are willing to bring him and play with them. They are really kind and know that my boyfriend does not deserve to be left out.

If anyone is concerned about how I will get the Switch, no worries, my contributor contacted me that someone from my college is offering their Switch so I did text him and he is cool with it! He did offer me at a much lower price than the original price of the Switch. I asked him to rethink and we agreed on $200 since he recently got the AC Switch edition. Not going to lie but the donations from my boyfriend's friends are pretty big so I can pay the remaining ($60 remaining)! 

 I thanked his friends for contributing and offered my doodles as a gift in return. **I do not need donations but I feel like sharing this!**

Right now, the person with the Switch is sending it to my house and I will pay as soon as it arrived. He wanted to do this way to make sure it shipped to me safely. The Switch is the Gray version and is HAC-001 but I didn't mind since I will have the Neon Joy-Cons arriving in few hours (not revealing the color).

There is a chance I will have the Switch in last week of March/first week of April.

So why am I sharing this? This story is a special one and all I have to say is... true friends do exist and leaves no one behind. Thank you all for reading it. I can’t help it but share this. 

If anyone wants updates from me, I will try to get you all updated. If there is any confusion I made in this post, I will try my best to clear it up.

fpgxsa,Aelfric_Stormbringer,Bravely Default II Demo Discussion,"So, after the Mini Direct today the demo for Bravely Default II dropped. I've played it for around 45 minutes at this point, and here's my general thoughts on it so far.

* Right from the start, it's clear this game will look and sound amazing. Revo has returned as composer, which means we're going to hear a lot of the same general tunes from the first game. Not necessarily a good or bad thing, but I do hope he breaks out into new music and styles. The game also looks awesome. Character models and designs are great (especially the job appearances), and the world looks gorgeous as usual. Lastly, the voice actors have a bit more accent variety this time around, with the main characters having an American, British English, Scottish, and perhaps Irish accent (I can't really get a read on the one girl). 
* The menus have been overhauled to be both more streamlined and also somehow less informative. You set jobs and subjobs from the same menu, with a secondary menu popping up on job selection with the option between main and sub. Hovering over a job shows the skills it learns in the right section, and the ""-"" button changes that screen to a stat display, showing the changes if you set the job as your main. As far as I can tell, though, there's no way to see what those stats do exactly like in the first two games. The equipment menu is similarly streamlined, and hovering over a piece of gear displays all of its stats in a pop-up window.
* There are some pretty important stat changes. Basic stats are gone (Strength, Intelligence, etc), replaced by the pure calculated stats (Physical Attack and Defense, etc). Healing power has been decoupled from Magic Defense as well and Critical Chance is a displayed stat. Unfortunately, there's a new addition: Weight. Equipment now has weight, with each class having weight limits and better gear weighing more. If you go over the weight limit, your offensive stats (attack, speed, crit) start going down. Not great. Characters also have the same base stats, though that might just be a demo simplification.
* Spells also got a pretty major change. Instead of having Spell Levels with multiple spells included (for instance, Black Magic 1 having Fire, Blizzard, and Thunder), classes now naturally learn spells as they grow. This means that the job level cap will be much, much higher than in the first two games. The demo only goes up to level 7, but that only gives access to Black/White Magic 2 spells. 
* And now we get to, what I consider, the worst aspect of the game: the combat. The first two games had it pretty much perfect. Random encounters with an adjustable rate, select all of your actions at the start of the round and watch it play out, and Default **actually fucking matters**. This game appears to be scrapping all of that, to the extreme detriment of the gameplay. There are now visible encounters with the ability to strike the enemy on the map to gain an advantage (unsure what that advantage is, though, because it's definitely not a preemptive strike). Turns in combat are now ""play them as they come,"" meaning that you select actions when the character pops up in the turn order. It makes combat reactive rather than proactive, and makes **Default completely useless beyond building BP**. You can't defend at the start of the round anymore, instead only getting to defend when your turn comes up, which for slower (and squishier, mind you) characters means after all of the enemies have acted and killed your party. This is an absolute mess, and honestly makes me fear for the rest of the game.

There is a lot of good in this demo. It's gorgeous, sounds amazing, and made some nice QoL changes in the menus. But the core of the game, the part that actually matters, has been almost completely ruined. I love the Bravely games, and would put them at the top of my RPG list, but this game is rapidly shaping up to be a skip or heavy discount purchase from me.",112,1585247764,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpgxsa/bravely_default_ii_demo_discussion/,NintendoSwitch,1

fpgckd,___TheKid___,Panzer Dragoon Remake - Not a smooth ride so far,"As an avid fan of REZ I was looking forward to this release. The visuals are okay-ish. The soundtrack is great. But the controls are very stiff and feel like they even have a delay (especially when switching the camera angle). The whole game appears very choppy in general. 
Sadly not the smooth and fun ride I was expecting.

Anybody sharing this opinion? Or do I miss something based in it being a classic game with a cult following. So it might was important to keep the gameplay as it was without smoothing it up? (Like Street Fighter 2)",18,1585245904,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpgckd/panzer_dragoon_remake_not_a_smooth_ride_so_far/,NintendoSwitch,0

fpfyfj,zirconst,"Tangledeep has a massive free update today, including a full DLC expansion for free plus an optional 2nd one! Enjoy tons of new content for our debut 16-bit roguelike dungeon crawler.","Since Tangledeep first launched on Switch in February 2019, I've been blown away by the amazing support from the Switch community. 

Today, I'm pleased to announce a *truly epic update* for our SNES-inspired 16-bit dungeon crawler that includes over 6 months of improvements from the PC version, plus the entirety of the **Legend of Shara** DLC expansion (normally $8 on PC)... completely free! 

(If you haven't played Tangledeep before, you can check out the [eShop page w/ trailer](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tangledeep-switch/). It's an indie game that combines a very FF6/Chrono Trigger/Secret of Mana inspired aesthetic with traditional turn-based roguelike gameplay, plus a job system a la Final Fantasy Tactics and loot similar to ARPGs like the Diablo series. If that ticks any of your boxes, you're in for a treat!)

At the same time, we're **also** launching the optional **Dawn of Dragons** DLC ($5), which adds even more content that will challenge the most veteran players!

We're making the main update + Legend of Shara totally free as a way to give back to our Switch fans who have supported the game since day one. In particular, this community has been really enthusiastic about the game, and I think you'll be very hype to see what these expansions have in store.

[Legend of Shara for Switch Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C0dC926Pbg) / [Dawn of Dragons for Switch Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4207bFgjAg)

**Legend of Shara / Main Patch Notes:**

* New unlockable playable character and story mode (available once you defeat the 2nd boss) with new gameplay and progression mechanics
* New endgame area: **Realm of the Gods**, where the mightiest monsters of all dwell
* New item type - **Relics** \- randomly-generated legendary items that can combine tons of powers, found in...
* **Wanderer's Journeys** \- Self-contained mini-dungeons ranging from 12 to 50 floors, with completely new monsters and level layouts, all with different scenarios
* Lots of new monsters, from frogs and bandits to the ethereal **Eidolon**
* New **magic modifiers** (affixes/suffixes) for gear, plus legendary items
* New high tier **equipment** to discover and enchant
* New **playable job** \- the Calligrapher - that combines dual wielding mastery with elemental scrolls and rune attacks
* Raised **level cap** (15 --&gt; 20)
* Innumerable bug fixes, tweaks, performance improvements and balance changes to smooth out and enhance the playing experience

\---

And here's a quick FAQ based on questions we've seen on our Discord and r/Tangledeep subreddit!

**Q. What do I need to do to get the Legend of Shara expansion?**

**A.** Just download the latest update! No need to buy or redeem anything at all. It's built into the game.

**Q. How do I play as Shara?**

**A.** If you already have a save file where you've met Shara, continue that game and you should see the mode unlock automatically. If not, beat the second boss and talk to her for the first time. From that point on, Shara's campaign will be available in all save files.

**Q. Should I play the base game before getting Dawn of Dragons?**

**A.** Dawn of Dragons' main feature is a new quest that begins at level 12. You can do it anytime after that. However, there's other content - like new items, monsters, and magic mods - that will enhance the game starting at level 1. If you've never played Tangledeep and haven't made it to the lategame yet, I recommend playing the base game first.

**Q. Should I restart my save file to get all the new content?**

**A.** Nope, no need! Well, you can if you want. But you'll immediately be able to start working toward the higher level cap, find higher tier items, and play through Wanderer's Journeys on that file. In fact, if you want to reach Realm of the Gods, having an existing save file to build on can be pretty helpful.

**Also, we've put the game on sale in both North America and Japan starting today!** (EU will see the sale begin on 3/30). Enjoy!",44,1585244672,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpfyfj/tangledeep_has_a_massive_free_update_today/,NintendoSwitch,23
fpfvck,Agent4834,The Switch has glitter in the plastic?!,"So I bought this switch New in Japan Summer 2018. The Body including the original back plate have this glitter in it. It only really shows up in Direct sunlight. I have replaced the back plate, still have the original.

fpft5b,Suikodont,Animal Crossing. I don't get it.,"Disclaimer: I've never played AC before, nor do I intend to do it now. I'm simply not interested. But as I've read numerous times now, that people who never played before are equally hyped / blown away, I'm all the more confused.

Don't get me wrong. If you love Animal Crossing, have fun with it. It's awesome that so many people get to love a thing and spent time with it. It's just confusing and irritating to not only not being able to join the fun but really being constantly flabbergastet about this hype.

I know the following things:

\- Nostalgia likely plays a huge part for many people, I get that. I'm a nintendo nerd since my childhood.

\- In our darkest timeline right now, the idea of having some light fun, endless positivity and complete escapism has to be compelling for many people.

\- It's probably very easy to learn. The slow pace and (I guess?) rewarding gameplay probably generate a chilled loop to make time pass by. I also get that.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't get is the sheer amount of hype. I've read on this sub that AC outsold Pokemon. Like wtf? Animal Crossing was always this .. I don't know kinda niche game to me. For a certain crowd who likes that stuff. Like Harvest Moon or something. Btw I played Stardew Valley and really liked that, so I understand how addicting these concepts can be.

It just seems to come out of nowhere. I know, the hype started early on but since a couple of months before the release, it's fucking everywhere. And I simply don't understand why. When I first saw the screenshots I honest to god thought it was some cheap mobile game coming to switch. Then, I saw posts about ""why couldn't Pokemon have these graphics?"" and ""oh my god, this looks amazing!"" .. and it.. kinda doesn't? It looks incredibly boring and childish to me. Yeah, I've seen the aquarium and the water effects are nice but come on.. really? The graphics of all things?

I've read articles and watched a ton of reviews, so I've seen enough gameplay footage. And it still looks boring. Not only the graphics, but the gameplay itself. It seems limited compared to something like Stardew Valley, which at least hase some nice pixle art. Maybe I simply don't know any better. But I've rarely seen anyone do anything else but hunt butterflies, collect sea shells or plant flowers.

I wouldn't even talk about any of that if this was just a game like so many others. Something for people to enjoy who like that kind of thing. But this is THE BIG RELEASE of the year on the Switch it seems. It may even be bigger than Zelda or Mario at this point and that's just... my brain can't cope with that. It's like everybody has gone nuts.

People praise things about this game that leave me completely speechless. And everyone I know is playing and having the best time of their lives. This may sound jelous.. and maybe it is to a certain degree. But sometimes it feels more like a cult.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I don't want to attack anybody who likes Animal Crossing. Have fun. God knows we need to have something nice in this fucked up world right now. Maybe that's the biggest part of the hype. And like I said: I'd understand that.

Just wanted to share my confusion. Maybe I'm not the only one.

fpfqvc,raou_k,Issue with NAT traversal process,Ever since late February I haven’t been able to connect to another person’s switch when I try to connect to their island on ACNH or farm on Stardew. It shows the error message and says ‘Cannot connect to other consoles. NAT traversal process has failed’  I was able to before just fine but ever since I haven’t been able to and it says my NAT type is B and so is the other person’s. They’re able to connect to my island/farm but I’m not able to for them. I don’t really know why it started this or how to fix it.,1,1585244041,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpfqvc/issue_with_nat_traversal_process/,NintendoSwitch,0

fpfow3,Juriloso,Custom Nintendo Switch?,"I was thinking about buying a Nintendo Switch but I dislike the colours, and thought that maybe someone was selling customised Nintendos. So I found this website, Colorware, where you can order a customised Switch. It is quite expensive so I don’t know if it’s a good option given that I don’t know much about the quality. I’ve found a few YouTube videos and they look great, though. I know that a vynil sticker to change the Nintendo’s appearance is enough, but it is not recommended to do it. So I was wondering if any of you have bought one and if you would recommend it.

fpfefd,FeistyTurnover2,Konck Off Ring-Cons,"Hi Everyone! I've seen that Ring Fit Adventure is Sold out pretty much everywhere. I went on eBay to see if I could find someone selling it, but had no success. What I did find, however, was a lot of chinese Ring-Con Knock offs. I Instantly started to wonder about the following:

Since the game is sold out, perhaps one could buy the knock offs and then digitally download the game. This doesn't work, as the game is not sold digitally.

How would the game work with these knock offs?

Does anyone have any or any experience related to them? How do they do compared with the original Ring-cons? Just curious, not that I intend to buy one. It's that I just can't find anything online: no videos, no articles about those. Nothing. And I thought about asking the people who might use it.

fpew5a,mywifeleftme6969,Anyone think that Direct was a disappointment too?,"I just saw the new Direct, and I couldn't help but feel disappointed by it. I mean sure the new 2k games coming to Switch and Xenoblade are quite interesting, and maybe there was some stuff like Bravely Default II, that some people are interested in, but at least to me, that's about it. Especially that last news was disappointing. Nintendo often saves their best for last, but then they talked about the Pokemon Expansion Pass again? I mean sure, if this was just another Direct Mini, and it's just something I'm not particularly interested in, then yeah, fine by me, but we waited what, 6 months? Sure, corona probably delayed the direct, but even with that in mind, I was expecting some of Nintendo's bigger titles in development to have at least some attention.

fpeq4y,Ninten-Doh,My only switch friend has just sold his switch because we still can’t chat on the system,"We usually play together on Xbox. We just invite each other to party chat and pick a game to play together. We’ve been doing that for over 10 years now. We love Nintendo and the games but since Xbox 360 the only Nintendo games we would play is mario kart and that was when we were at one another’s house. But even that got less and less the more we got into playing online. Just meant we didn’t have to go to each other’s houses all the time. 

Anyway fast forward to launch. We both brought a switch at launch. Games awesome but we just never played online together because we can’t talk to each other on the system. Until this week I had never played online with him because of this. 

This week I tried to use discord with him but he said it’s so stupid because he has to use a headset on his phone and one on the switch. We actually ended up him having to talk to me through Xbox live and him playing docked mode. He got so frustrated with it he said “this is so stupid I’m selling my switch”. He’s just messaged me today saying he sold switch and brought the doom collectors edition with the money followed by “fancy some gears later”. 

I only really play switch now. I’ll only go on Xbox if he asks me to go on. I just prefer switch as my main system but why have we still got no way to party chat on the switch.",51,1585240822,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpeq4y/my_only_switch_friend_has_just_sold_his_switch/,NintendoSwitch,0

fpepsk,Rhoso,Questions about Animal Crossing and buying another switch for girlfriend,"My girlfriend and I have really been enjoying animal crossing, but it's apparent that the multiplayer is very limited for the second person. She can't even play online with her friend without swapping from her character to mine. So to fix this she would have to

- Buy her own switch
- Buy her own copy of animal crossing
- Buy her own Nintendo Online subscription

If she were to do all of this, which is totally ridiculous, would she still be able to continue her current villager on our current island and be able to play from both her switch and mine? She would get a switch lite, so she still wants the option to play on the living room TV via my regular switch. Also would this allow us to play at the same time more independently, without her being a ""follower""?

To start off let's talk about the online service. Switch Online's offering of classic games is less than ideal. The switch is both a handheld and a home console, so why not include classic games from Nintendo's handhelds, and their home consoles? I'm not a game designer but I'm certain that if the Wii can handle N64 games, and the 3ds can handle GB, GBC, and GBA games, Nintendo should easily be able to bring them to the switch. The switch is the perfect console for classic games, but out of  the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS, it's also the most lacking in that department, and there's so much more that they could do with their subscription service. The online aspect of the service is also fairly mediocre. Some games like Luigi's Mansion, and Splatoon 2 run fine, (for the most part) so why does Mario Maker 2 barely function? Also why do you need a phone for voice chat. Not everybody with a mic owns a phone, and the people that do might not want to get the app, causing people to uninstall the app when they see that people barely use it. Clearly the switch is able to use voice chat, as thrid party games like fortnite have it, so why doesn't nintendo include voice chat with their first party games, like splatoon, pokemon, (for trading and raid battles) and smash bros? 

Next, lets talk about the E-shop. The feature it needs most, (in my opinion) is a rating system. Right now there's no way on the eshop itself to see what others think about a game. It should 1-5 stars (like the 3ds). This would be beneficial for people who are considering buying the game to be able to look at the average rating. It would be more convenient than having to switch to another device to find the ratings. In the ""great deals"" section of the eshop, at the moment shovelware that's on sale for 99% off always ends up at the top of best sellers, which gets many people who have a bit of money left after buying a big eshop game to spend the extra penny to buy those games. This results in an unhealthy system where people buy the bad game play it for 5 minutes, never touch it again, and because it gets so many purchases it ends up on the top of best sellers where more people end up buying the game. The solution? To put the top rated games at the top of great deals rather than the cheapest. This is a  minor thing, but I think there should be music playing in the background of the eshop like on the Wii.

Next let's talk about Joy Con drift. There's not much to say about this that hasn't already been said, but the fact that $80 controllers only last 9 months before you have to repair them is infuriating. Also I'm disappointed that Nintendo only offered to fix them for free once they were threatened by a lawsuit.

Next let's talk about Mii functionality on the switch. Mii plaza and streetpass was a very welcome addition to the 3ds, and the minigames on it were quite a fun distraction, and encouraged you to meet other players. Mii's are still on the switch but they're almost hidden. You can only make them in settings now. Why not add a Mii Plaza to the switch's home menu, and offer all the minigames (including the paid ones) from the 3ds Mii Plaza for free? The switch has local multiplayer, so it can detect other switchs, meaning they can definitely reintroduce streetpass. I think it would be a nice feature to have the Miis walk around the home menu of the switch and  occasionally wave to the user.

Lastly lets talk about minor issues. Why are there no themes on the switch? Obviously they aren't neccessary, but people clearly want them. It's just a nice way to give the home menu more personality.  Another feature I would like is to see the exact amount of playtime you have on games rather than just ""played for about 45 hours"".

fpeia4,AndersonCouncil21228,Any games you specifically wouldn't recommend for the Switch Lite due to the lack of docking option?,"Hi!  


I just picked up a Nintendo Switch Lite and have been getting to grips with it having skipped out on a lot of the current and last gen console offerings after I returned to PC gaming. I've been excited by the huge list of games available on the Nintendo Store and have seen some that I already own on Xbox 360 or PC etc., which got me wondering about how good some games actually are when you can't dock the Switch Lite and play using the TV as your main monitor. Essentially I'm worried about getting spoiled by the fact that I'm used to playing a particular game on a bigger screen from before.  


I know that there's already a short list of games that just don't work on the Switch Lite (or not as well anyway) due to the absence of the separate JoyCon controllers but are there any games that really don't translate so well to the smaller screen i.e purely in handheld mode?   


I haven't been able to find any lists of games that are ""best"" for the Switch Lite specifically with most just opting for a general ""Best Games for the Nintendo Switch"" list which of course includes the original and upgrade models.

fpe322,schuey_08,"That Direct Mini was full of ""pointing"" for the Nintendo Switch library.","I'll first start off by saying that I see no reason in the world, particularly during the global health crisis, that Nintendo *needed* to give us anything today or anytime in the near future. The Nintendo Switch library is already very well established in what is now the beginning of Year 4 for this console. But what we've seen as a result of the Switch's sacrifice of power for portability is a consistent demand for the gems of recent generations to be ported, many of which have never been on a Nintendo console before.

From BioShock to Panzer Dragoon to Star Wars: Episode I Racer, so many of the titles announced today fill a void on someone's wish list. The announcement of Burnout Paradise is especially interesting, helping to fill a couple major voids for Nintendo: lack of racing games and lack of support from Electronic Arts. Forget the fact that's a renowned title in its own right.

After the half hour or so of footage, I couldn't help but be impressed that Nintendo had braved the economic and healthcare storms to do some unneeded but still very welcome patchwork on the house they have built. There's really no reason to have expected any news from them in a time like this, but there's plenty of reason to be grateful that they attempted to give us something to look forward to.",32,1585238709,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fpe322/that_direct_mini_was_full_of_pointing_for_the/,NintendoSwitch,3

fpe2d5,NuclearThane,Thoughts on the lack of a trophy/achievement system on Nintendo Switch?,"This topic has been brought up many times over the past few years. It always seems to stir massive controversy between those who *love* achievements, and those who couldn't care less about their implementation.

Nintendo's response to this is that the award for playing their games should be the act of playing them, not for an unnecessary digital trophy. I appreciate that sentiment, because sometimes achievements are boring, grindy or unnecessary.

However, that seems to be a concern that should be taken into consideration for Nintendo-exclusive games. Meanwhile, the Switch has an ever-growing collection of games that are also available on other consoles-- *with achievements included*.

Silly as it may be for people who don't care about achievement systems, many people I've spoken to about it feel that due to this, they're getting *less* in the Switch version-- and oftentimes Switch versions of games cost more anyway.

Several arguments have been brought up, such as developers being able to implement their own trophies if they choose, as can be seen in games like *Hollow Knight* or *Ori and the Blind Forest*. 

Whatever your opinion on it is, these achievement systems have been implemented on other consoles for over a decade. While I respect Nintendo's philosophy on the subject, it really does seem like you're missing out on something if you're a fan of trophies-- and in some cases this has led to my roommates and I getting certain games on PS4 instead (even if the idea of having it on Switch was preferable).

The bottom line here always comes to ""don't tell me how to have fun"". And I get that. But if you don't like achievements, you don't have to do them. So especially for games that already have trophy lists on other consoles-- why not implement the system on Switch? It seems like a missed opportunity. But the Switch has had a lot of those.

Then please open any game and lock the console (put it to sleep) for a few seconds, and then press the power button again as if to unlock it and check if your left joycon is vibrating just the tiniest bit. It's a lot less intense than the normal vibrations. (For me it's two vibrations with a bit of a delay. One small vibration and then another one even less intense than the first one.)

Still no signal. It will charge just fine. The hdmi cable is the original and I tested it out on other devices and it worked and tried a different hdmi on the dock.... Nothing. Am I stuck with getting a replacement dock now or does anyone else have any ideas?

This was one of the most anticipated Directs since Nintendo hasn't announced a lot in 2020, so I feel like it would have been a good opportunity to announce it and let the hype grow. 

My only thought as to why they didn't is because Nintendo didn't think they had many exciting announcements. But I thought it had some good ones! Xenoblade, which a lot of people had been asking for, 2K games, Bravely Default 2, and the sizzle reel at the end had a lot!

fpalc0,Bleus4,A brand new Mario Kart is (probably) coming this year - here is why:,"1. **It's time** \- the last entirely new, mainline Mario Kart game, released 6 years ago. Usually, we have seen a 3-year gap between entries, starting all the way back from MK DS and continuing on through MK8. If you count in the Deluxe version of 8 on Switch, that pattern actually still holds up as that released in 2017 - and a new entry this year would be 3 years after that again!
2. **Mario Kart 8 is clearly done for** \- while MK8 has sold insanely well and received praise from critics and fans alike, new content is not relevant anymore. Many think Nintendo should just continue making DLC, but it has shown to not be their strategy. There's been no DLC since mid-2018, with no new tracks since *2015.* If more cups were coming, they'd have been here by now.
3. **But they have been up to something** \- the team that worked on MK8 were the same behind ARMS. That released in June 2017, with DLC wrapping up late that year. Since then we seemingly have not seen anything new released or even announced from them, but this gap of time lines up perfectly with the aforementioned development/release cycle of Mario Kart games.
4. ***Mario Kart Tour serves a purpose*** *-* Nintendo stated in 2015 that their mobile games *""will become an opportunity for the great number of people around the world who own smart devices ... to be interested in Nintendo IP and eventually to become fans of our dedicated game systems"".* Perhaps, MK Tour released last year as a prelude and sales driver, for a new MK game on Switch in 2020?
5. **The big holiday title for 2020 is still unknown** \- in Q4 of every year, Nintendo releases a *system seller* for Switch. Mario Odyssey in 2017, Smash Ultimate in 2018 and Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield in 2019. Rumours say Breath of the Wild 2 needs more time in the oven, so what other system selling series are left that could have a release window for 2020? Either 3D Mario - or *Mario Kart.*

fp9lzj,Kalikor1,Question regarding Nintendo Online (Family Plan) and Nintendo Vouchers,"Hello everyone!

First time posting here, hopefully I am not missing this being answered somewhere or breaking any rules.

I did something bit stupid and am trying to figure out if I can fix it.

I went to buy Animal Crossing online for me and the wife to play together, we both have our own switches, and my birthday is in a few days anyway, so I was going to get 2 digital copies. I have switch online for myself, so I have access to buying Nintendo vouchers, and it was cheaper to buy the 2 pack of those then it was to buy 2 copies separately.

I had never used the vouchers before, and the purchase page didn't make it immediately clear, but as you may know....you can't gift the vouchers or even any of the games. I did not know this, and already bought the vouchers, and redeemed one copy for myself - it was then that it became clear that I couldn't gift a game to the wife.

I found some vague references online saying you can (maybe?) activate it on another switch if that person's account is part of your family and you have a family plan? Can anyone confirm this?

It would be cheaper for me to buy 1 year of family plan (discounted a bit to around $30 with coins) then it would for me to buy another copy for her from Amazon or whatever for $60 :(.

Either way I won't be able to afford the other gift to myself but, if I could at least salvage this situation that would be great. The wife LOVES Animal Crossing so much, I am actually getting into it for the first time, so really I wanted to do this for her to make her happy, and thus by extension myself lol, even if I had to use my own birthday money to do it.

Anyway if anyone has experience with this I would be so grateful if you could answer. I don't want to grab the family plan in desperation only to find out that doesn't work either. I don't know why Nintendo hates people so much in regards to gifting games :(.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. It probably doesn't help the store is in Japanese since I live here now with my wife. I read and speak Japanese but, it's possible I missed something somewhere. Only thing I really noticed as far as warnings go was 1 game per 1 switch, and that you needed to have Nintendo Online (Which be both do, but individually)",5,1585220490,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fp9lzj/question_regarding_nintendo_online_family_plan/,NintendoSwitch,1

I recently bought a Nintendo Switch Lite due to the Animal Crossing trend but realized it was always asking for verification to see if I can play my game.  

I sold my old Nintendo Switch Console way back at a Gamestop but remembered I just handed them my console and forgot to deactivate my information so techincally my account is still attached to that old console.  The eshop on my switch lite won't even give me the option to make it my primary.

How do I do so, please help.

fp8ht5,spaldingmatters,"So just over 3 years into the Switch's lifespan, what are your favorite games on the system, and why?","The Switch has perhaps established itself as my favorite console ever over the last 3 years - I always loved Nintendo handhelds, but the quality of titles they and other companies have put out for the system has been simply stellar. 

I am curious what everyone's favorite games have been so far. It would be nice for people to list a few and perhaps give an explanation for maybe just a few of them games, on why they enjoyed them as much as they did.


For me, my personal favorite:

**Splatoon 2** - The original Splatoon was a game I was extremely fond of already, and this just improved upon it in almost every way. Splatoon may be perhaps the most creative shooter on the market. While I didn't enjoy the main campaign, I must say the Octo Expansion DLC is one of my favorite single player campaigns ever, and it really elevated the game.

Rounding out my top 10, in no order:

**Breath of the Wild**


**Super Smash Bros. Ultimate** 


**Super Mario Odyssey** - while I missed some of the challenge of Super Mario 3D World's later levels (and the co-op), this was just as good a game in its own right. Endlessly creative and joyful. 

**Hollow Knight** 

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** - haven't played it as much as I did the original Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, but it remains that same excellent title

**Ring Fit Adventure** - probably the best fitness game out there. Extremely fun way to get some exercise in, especially when quarantined, and, more importantly, it is very effective as a fitness tool as well. 

**Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

**Xenoblade Chronicles 2**

**Pokemon Sword and Shield** - don't know if others loved it, but I did. My favorite since Gen 5 at least. The Wild Area and raiding really stood out to me here.

Mario/Zelda/Animal Crossing/Splatoon/Pokemon/Smash are probably some of the most generic games one can choose lol, but I think they have well-earned reputations. 

Curious to know what you all enjoy :)",46,1585214426,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fp8ht5/so_just_over_3_years_into_the_switchs_lifespan/,NintendoSwitch,1

First of all, I do not have a Switch myself so any of the response that you could send me, could it be detailed to not get lost? I literally have 0 clue of where is something in the settings and something like that

&amp;#x200B;

So,  I bought my girlfriend the Nintendo Switch on Christmas and also purchased online Stardew Valley. But I've been wondering if there is a possibility to buy a game and instead of having the portrait in home's, is there a possibility to have it with an envelope like some gift? Like the games you used to have in the DSi menu, I don't know if you guys know what I mean. I wanna buy it for her while she doesn't look, and let her have the gift in the Home's until she realize it.

&amp;#x200B;

She got a bit bored of Stardew Valley now, since she has like 400h already, so I wanted to buy her something with a similar playstyle, and ACNH looks really cute for her plus I've heard that there is some couch co-op, that would be awesome for the quarantine we're suffering (boredom hits hard).

fp6y5q,Ninten-Doh,IMO: They wouldn’t delay direct for this pandemic if they are still releasing games,"The direct is just a video announcing what’s coming out in the future. So thinking “they must have delayed the direct because of corona” is not the reason at all I think. 

1. Japan has gone back to almost normal now. People are out and about and back to work as normal

2. This would be the absolute perfect time to do a direct as almost everyone outside of japan is at home

3. The release dates would not even have to have official dates and they can always be delayed as many many games have done in the past. Many games usually just say (late 2020 or 4Q etc)

4. Games are still being released. If they were going to delay a direct to tell you when games are coming out it would be the games being delayed not a video 

5. They’ve not come out and actually said “we are postponing a direct due to this” which is way more likely what they would do. They did this during an earthquake in japan last year I think. I know they had already posted the date but I think they would have said something by now regarding it

So realistically they just don’t have enough coming soon to make a video and are just going to show a e3 direct near June. They’ve had the massive hit with animal crossing which is what they were banking on which keeps fans and share holders happy. I don’t believe they would show a direct in April just to show the exact same stuff in a direct 2 months later. It wouldn’t make sense today.

fp3os1,Lipsyte,Secondary switch for kids: digital games access ?,"Hello! 

As a family with 2 little kids, we decided to purchase a second switch so they could play while the primary switch is being used.

I added kids profiles under the supervisor (wife!) account in our family group, logged on the new switch with my wife's profile and downloaded the games we had bought digitally. 

Unfortunately, the kids' profiles can't access the games (""this user cannot play this game""). The only way to start the games is to do it with the wife's profile, but then the main switch is disconnected.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is, is there any way to have the following :

\- Wife on switch A (administrator) plays game X

\- Kids with accounts linked to a supervisor in a family group on switch B play game Y 

\- All digital games purchased from wife's account

&amp;#x200B;

fp3lq8,ishgever,Is now a really stupid time to buy a switch (if I can even find one)?,"Like many of you, I haven't been able to work because of the thing that shall not be named. However, I've also had a medical emergency and undergone surgery in the last week, with another one coming up in about a month and a half. If social distancing wasn't isolating me enough, the fact that I can't even do any exercise beyond a very slow and short walk is really taking a toll.

I'm not really a gamer. I haven't actually really gamed at all since I was a kid, when I played Zelda: Ocarina of Time obsessively. 

I brought that Nintendo 64 out recently and played Zelda again. I really liked it, and that made me consider getting a switch.

I can see that it's a great console and I really am intrigued by the Breath of the Wild, Mario and Animal Crossing games. However, since I'm not a gamer, I don't know what else this console has to offer in terms of games. Judging by my liking of Zelda and stuff, it seems like my type of game is more the adventure style game (is that the term?). People keep telling me that PS4 is better in terms of the games available for that, and that other than Zelda and Mario the other games are all ""childish"" battle style games to play at home with family or friends (which isn't an option during this time, obviously).

Without an income right now it might seem like a crazy purchase, but I figure I'll have a lot of time rehabilitating from surgery and isolating because of the pandemic. It's not like I'll be able to work for a while anyway. My work is claiming that they'll be able to have us working from home in a few weeks, so I'm kind of optimistic about that. Plus, I'm living with my parents right now so I don't have to worry about bills or rent and without the ability to go out, I have nothing to really spend my small savings on beyond helping my family with food and stuff.

The other thing that concerns me as a non-gamer is whether this console is about to be superseded. I know devices always are, but is a new console about to come out in 2 months that will make this obsolete? I know we don't know for sure, but just on rumours etc.

TLDR; I know this isn't a decision anyone came make but me, but as I'm so clueless about gaming and have no idea about what types of games the Switch has and whether it'll be useful for a long period of time, I'd really appreciate your input.",16,1585189978,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fp3lq8/is_now_a_really_stupid_time_to_buy_a_switch_if_i/,NintendoSwitch,1

fp2jlb,NikkoBer04,Stripped Switch Screws i cannot get out for the life of me (and a tiny rant),"For about a week and a half I’ve been trying to repair my switch’s right joycon slider rail. I got inside and realized I needed thermal paste to close it back up, so I got it. Then I got to the rail itself and when it came down to the last two screws, they wouldn’t budge. I was pissed. I asked my dad to help me get those last two screws out and I feel like he made it worse because they went from their plus shapes to circles. I tried to tell him to stop as he’s making it worse and he just kept going. I’ve tried everything to fix it, and asked my dad to get superglue today. I tried to unscrew them myself but putting superglue on the screwdriver and waiting for it to dry inside the nail, but my dad was being impatient and put superglue where the nail part was. To salvage his attempt, I put the screwdriver on the nail and he asked what was I doing and I tried to explain but he acted like he knew what he was doing and made me stop. I got frustrated (still am) and took all my switch stuff to my room. I feel like he’s been trying to help but makes it worse.

fp26lg,_AMOF_,"Switch docks on TV fine, but screen doesnt work!!","Hi everyone,
First and foremost thank you for taking a look at my post and if you offered any form of help thank you so mutch again! 

I recently bought the animal crossing edition switch, and as soon as I opened it out of the box I started having screen problems. During set up my switch screen acctualy went black and would do the standard backlight lights up but screen displays nothing crap. One soft reset later and I've gotten my way through inital set up. Fast forward to a day into playing animal crossing and it happens again requiring another reset. This problem happens again another 4 times across 3 days. I come home after work today and go to wake my switch and have the same screen problem again, I think "" oh great, whatever just have to hard reset"". I hard reset and the screen problem persist, an multiple hours worth of digging into online forums and post everyone is saying about how you just need to hard reset your switch.

Things I've tried:
1) soft/hard reset
2) holding power button with vol. Up and down
3) trying to boot with multiple nintendo brand ac adapters (family has multiple switches)

Please if anyone can help me or give me any recommendations, I'm at my witts end and so unbelievably sad. Thank you again for reading my post and please pass along to anyone that may know how to fix this problem.

Note: I typed this on my phone so sorry for any typos, bad grammar and spelling is on my part lmao.",7,1585184341,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fp26lg/switch_docks_on_tv_fine_but_screen_doesnt_work/,NintendoSwitch,1
fp22ec,VintageKonrad,Our fast-paced puzzle game NecroWorm cometh to Switch... with a free demo,"S'yath Ableth, my friends! I bring word from the Coterie of Esoteric Eradicators.

Our seer has just determined that the coming of NecroWorm to Nintendo Switch cannot be postponed.

It is common knowledge that the only point of NecroWorm's existence is to consume all on his way without biting into his own neverending tail. Snake you say? A ghastly serpent indeed.

The only way to appease the spectral vermin is to give aid. We have devised this free demo as a safety measure. However only beating the full game, which is releasing tomorrow by the way, can fully satiate the wyrm's hunger.

I saw that the game Picross S2 was discussed once before but I never played any of the picross games and was curious which would be the best to get based on your guy's favourite ones. Since they've been released for a while now, I was hoping that a consensus of which one is the best/favourite would be available and checking Reddit was the best idea I had. 

 If anyone here doesn't mind giving me some good information it would be appreciated, trying to find a new game to help pass the time. I played a picross game on my phone before but that's all the experience I have with it.

I decided to make a poll of a few I saw on the Nintendo Switch site that seemed decent/interesting and if there are ones that are your favourite and aren't listed, feel free to openly discuss them in the comments!

Thanks!

fp0qhl,Sage24601,"Looking at first Switch, debating whether to grab a Lite","My debate, as per the title is debating between a Lite or the normal/OG. My main use (ignoring this* going on), would largely be using it just for my own while I'm out &amp; about, taking transit for my getting around, playing while stoned at friends places, and if I'm lounging about. Mostly I love the weight difference between holding my brother's OG and my best friend's new Lite, finding the Lite so much more comfortable and less crampy than the OG. The only thing that I'm not sure on is I think I'd miss the functionality to hook up to the tv, for when I want to play at home.

My main gaming is my Xbox One X, on a 4k tv, but I've been curious about grabbing a Switch for a while now. I love Nintendo, have had every Nintendo system so far, though admittedly never used the Wii U very much. It almost hit the mark, but wasn't quite there for the portable and such, which is what I've wanted a Switch for. I love Smash Bros and Mario Kart, Pokémon is forever in my heart, though I'm still unsure of Sword/Shield. Easy access to a lot of games I'm already playing/wanting to play would be fantastic, plus the huge indie library is something that I have a huge fondness for. Plus having my own screen when playing things was the biggest reason I loved playing with the Wii U.

Would it be worth the extra bit for the larger one, or should I save a bit, get a Lite, and see how I think of it?",7,1585179031,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fp0qhl/looking_at_first_switch_debating_whether_to_grab/,NintendoSwitch,1

I've looked at some of the popular grip cases, but none of them are quite what I'm looking for. I don't like the extended right grip on the Satisfye case, and I'm afraid that the Skull and Co one might cause stress on the joy-cons rails over time.

In my opinion, the perfect case would be one that apes the WiiU gamepad. The way you nustle your middle fingers against the ridge on the gamepad back is very comfortable. Do any of you know a grip case that that features something familiar?

foz9c8,furretguy,What are your games to play during quarantine?,"Man I've had such a bad day that I got to direct my mind onto something more positive, so why not Switch games haha. Hope you don't mind, only looking for convos

I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing. I love the Nook Miles goals and catching bugs and fish. It is the simplest yet calmest game. Love it. I recently caught one of those rare fish (ceoacanth? I cant spell it) and got 100 fish caught in a row for fishing master. I'm trying every night to go to tarantula island again so I can sell them onto Flick when he arrives. I've got that 500,000 bell loan to pay back. 

For more action I've picked up Dragon Quest XI again. The voice acting and story is so amazing. I really love all the unique monsters and upgrading weapons. I still have to find out how to get different armour and how to have characters wear it. I'll learn some day, it's probably really simple. 

I bought Night in the Woods a few days ago. I'm loving the art style so far. I can't wait to get more into the story and to perfect skills with those mini games. (Not trying to spoil incase someone hasn't played it yet). The music is really really good. 

I'm not into any other games right now so I'm going to save up a bit to pay back for joycons I had to buy yesterday.

foz3f1,JustStayYourself,Pro Controller doing random double inputs on all shoulder buttons.,"I'm getting insanely sick of the quality regarding the Switch. One joycon is broken already after a total of 10 uses..? Pro Controller 1 broken after a year with extreme drift and Pro Controller 2 is now also having weird as hell issues after maybe two months. 

So my new problem is the following:  
L1: ctrl + space (ctrl is normal, space is not).  
L2: pageup + escape (Shouldn't be either).  
R1: alt + pagedown (alt is normal, pagedown is not).  
R2: tab + enter (Shouldn't be either).  

All the other buttons work fine and are completely normal. It's such a freaking weird problem I don't know where to begin.

The things I've tried:  
- Checking steam and controller settings  
- Switching a ton of settings  
- Re-installing drivers  
- Trying it out on my wifes PC (Same problem)  
- Trying it through both wired and bluetooth (No difference).  

Before I am accused of improper use etc, I am a general console/game collector and I have never had any console/controller break on me before... It's massively disappointing how bad these things are.  

If anyone has any clue on what I can attempt I'd love to hear it. But I am really close to abolishing these controllers entirely and just switching to something of better quality.",3,1585173262,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/foz3f1/pro_controller_doing_random_double_inputs_on_all/,NintendoSwitch,1

foxz35,CimmerianBreeze,Sharing account across devices (Odd situation),"Hello reddit,

My older brother is on deployment with the Navy and is currently on a ship for the next several months at least. They don't have decent internet access and he's been getting crazy bored. I bought him a switch because I know he wants to play BotW, Link's Awakening, Diablo 3 and Stardew Valley. 

I already own all of these games on my switch. Link's Awakening, Diablo 3 and Stardew Valley are all digital, BotW is physical. 

The new Switch came in and I've linked my account to it. I know he can't access the games if I'm currently playing any of them ( I likely won't as I've been through all of them several times and I'd rather him be able to play them). I tried to put this switch into airplane mode to simulate his situation and the Switch just tells me to turn off airplane mode if I'm allowed to and won't open a game. 

I'm not trying to double dip. I will just buy the games again if that's what it comes down to. But is there any way to make this work? Can I send them from my switch to this new one and make him an account so he owns them? Will he be able to play the games at all in what's essentially airplane mode all the time without issue?

There are Switch A and Switch B, owned by User X and User Y respectively. Both of their accounts are on each other's switch, and both user have linked their switches to their own Nintendo Account. User X has bought ACHZ, and since the profile of User X is also on Switch B, User Y can play ACHZ using the profile of User X on Switch B. Now, User Y has purchased ACHZ on his profile, but User Y wants to continue the save stored in profile of User X on Switch B in his own profile. To do that, the save in the profile of User X on Switch B has to transfer to User Y.

Now, I would like to ask if the following solution (similar to the post above) works?

1. Firstly, User Y unlinks the Nintendo Account of both User X and Y on Switch B
2. Then, User Y links the unlinked-profile of User X to User Y

Theoretically, all the saves of User X on Switch B will now be user Y.  Anyone knows if it still works? It would be great to know if it works specifically on ACHZ as well, since saves of ACHZ are ""special"" (i.e. one island per switch). 

Thank you in advance.",8,1585168585,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/foxpyc/achz_transferring_save_between_profile_on_the/,NintendoSwitch,1

foxd1n,jmh0403,For those who still need a switch,"I would recommend downloading apps like Best Buy and Target if you haven’t already. Last night at work I looked up switches (getting one for the mrs in May), and wasn’t aware of the insane shortage of them. Since then, I’ve been frequently checking all stores’ websites for an update on their inventory to see if they got more, but to no avail.

Until this morning.

I woke up about 6:15ish and checked my apps again. To my surprise, my local Target was updated with “limited stock.” I got to Target this morning before it opened, and there were plenty of people lined up at the door already. Doors opened at 8, and I immediately went right to the electronics and got help from an employee. The switches were not on display, and the employee told me they didn’t have anymore, but I pressed and they eventually got one for me in the back (I genuinely believe he didn’t think we had one). So there’s still hope for those of you out there who need one.

My takeaway is this:
- frequently check local stores’ inventory online

- your best bet of securing one is going in person because you and everyone else are waiting to claim those couple that show up online. I’ve heard people say they add them to their cart online and before they have a chance to checkout they’re gone as quick as they were stocked

- go early if you can. I realize schedules and jobs don’t always allow for people to wait in the morning for doors to open, but you have a much greater advantage

The struggle is real folks, but you can definitely get one if you’re willing and able to put in the work to get ahead of everyone else. Stay safe out there!",11,1585167393,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/foxd1n/for_those_who_still_need_a_switch/,NintendoSwitch,1

I say that vaguely, as I'm not fully aware of what I may be missing out on. I know I had to pull my son away from making designs, which is what he'd prefer to spend his time doing, to help progress us so I could get an axe.. at this point, he's still in a tent, and I'm about to pay my second loan..

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know of a resource that helps define what player one needs to accomplish to keep the game progressing? I am not happy that this game is becoming something that feels like it has homework involved, but I'll be more upset not knowing what I'm being locked out of.

What does everyone think? Is Nintendo throwing themselves to the wolves for the upcoming shareholders meeting, or is it not really a big deal in regards to the quarter ending? Will they be fielding tons of questions regarding upcoming games?

I get that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe added the Wii U DLC. But really if you bought a Wii U (Shout out to those 5 people who did) and purchased that DLC, there's really nothing new excitingly new for you as far as I'm aware. 

Mario Kart Tour has some cool content (despite it being Mario Kart Tour). It has content for Mario Oddessy and Luigi's Mansion 3. Something that I was hoping would be DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, especially Luigi's Mansion 3.

Mario Kart Tour has Hammer Bros., different colors for Toad, Luigi's Mansion 3 style King Boo, etc...

Of course that it's a mobile game and that it's easier to develop content compared to a 8th gen (9th gen?) console. But there is money to be made for the Mario Kart DLC.

forpa5,ImmaculateNCheese,Farming shooting star fragments in Animal Crossing: New Horizons!,"I was pretty frustrated with getting shooting stars, but I think I found a way to reliably farm them. The only requirement is that you must know the system date and time of a meteor shower that already occurred. By the way, you do not need a daily announcement mentioning a meteor shower in order for one to happen. I *think* Celeste will always show up on the night of a meteor shower, but I'm not totally certain.

Once you know the date and time of a meteor shower, you can time travel to a minute or two right before it happens, then just wait for it to occur. Once you've wished on all the stars in that burst, you can save, then set the time backwards again to the same time (don't need to change the date since it's the same day) and repeat as many times as you want. 

The next day, your beach should be infested with star fragments. I've done this 3 times so far, so pretty sure it works. The only downside is that you probably don't want to move forward a day multiple times, so you should wish on many stars as possible so you only need to go forward once. Interestingly, the only zodiac fragments I've gotten are Aries Fragments. Not sure if maybe every island is a specific zodiac sign and can only get that piece, so maybe you need to trade to get the others.",140,1585148372,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/forpa5/farming_shooting_star_fragments_in_animal/,NintendoSwitch,1

It's been a wonderful way to spend time together, even on one player games like Zelda.  He stays with me every other week and will transfer his game data to my switch (mine is full version on the TV and his is a lite) so we can play on the TV.

My question - When he starts playing AC on his switch and moves his save data over, will he still be considered primary?  Or does have have to play on his own switch to use his island?

We move data around from  my switch to his frequently, so this will really suck if he can't move his data to mine to play on the TV.",5,1585147258,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/forekw/animal_crossing_and_two_switches_primary_on_both/,NintendoSwitch,1

so with the new animals crossing game, I have been playing a lot with my girlfriend. Sometimes there is a point where there is not lot to do for both of us. When one of us wants to redecorate the room for example one is just stopping playing. 

When you do not use the controller for a specific time it disconnects automatically. This can get really annoying after some time. 

Is there a possibility to stop the controllers from disconnecting? For example on my PS4 is an option to set after how long the controller disconnects automatically (5 minutes, 10 minutes, never - I think).

for38r,mr-cabten,Getting a Switch abroad during quarantine,"First and foremost, hope you are all doing well and staying safe.

I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but ever since the quarantine my mind has been possessed by the Switch hah. (That and existential dread and fear for the safety and future of humanity.)

I just need some peace in my mind. 

I live in Egypt and with my parents currently, so going outside is out of question and cabin fever has been slowly but steadily getting to us. Internet in Egypt is rather... Weak and unstable, so online entertainment is not a certainty. Hence, I have been thinking the entire time how cool it would be to have a Switch, since it's lightweight, hybrid and has a lot of neat party games that I could play with my folks to pass the time and introduce them to the wonders of gaming while we're at it. Problem is, the Switch has rather low presence in Egypt... We're more or a PlayStation (or how we call it ""blesteshon"") country. Only few retailers offer the Switch, and it's pretty heavily priced with 450-500USD retail and 350 used without games and in a dubious condition... Kinda bites considering the MSRP of 300$. Ordering from Amazon US also gets into the 500+$ with shipping and tax, and most eBay sellers don't deliver outside of the US. So I've been torn between splashing out big time or.. well, not getting it. I'd of course much rather buy a used one in decent condition and a fair price, but Egypt is yet to offer such luxury... 

So just to settle my mind once and for all: Is the Switch worth 450-500USD (game-less)? What are the best options to obtain one in my case, or should I just drop it? 

I just need to stop thinking about it and obsess over something else for a change before inevitably banging my head on the wall.

Thank you for any replies, and again I hope you're all doing well and are safe in these trying times.",5,1585146082,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/for38r/getting_a_switch_abroad_during_quarantine/,NintendoSwitch,1
foqzui,joshuadwilliams,Caught my first tarantula in AC:NH last night. The adrenaline was pumping!,"This is my first Animal Crossings game, so it's been pretty new for me. My 2nd daughter (20 and home from college) has been joining me in the fun, and we laugh together at all the funny things that happen to me. She's kind enough to watch and advise, and so far doesn't have much interest in playing. We started playing Sunday night.

On Monday night we saw our first tarantula. I was excited and pulled out my net and ran towards it. Oops, learned that lesson quickly as I woke up dazed in front of my house. Tried again to the same end. After that, I avoided any tarantula I saw and worked from home all-day Tuesday.

Last night by the time we got to playing, she had already researched a number of tactics for catching (without being knocked out) tarantulas. 

First strategy: build a wall of holes that you can jump over fleeing from an angry tarantula, and then catch it ""over the holes"".

So, dug the holes to create a ""safe for me"" zone, and wandered around looking for tarantulas. Nothing. Went about normal business of the day (iron nugget collecting, etc.) and waited for one to appear. During this time I tried to master the ""run directly at a hole so I jump over it quickly first try"", and we learned that this was easier said than done.

So, while I was fishing/scavenging, she searched for more strategies. From this new search, I learned a lot. Turns out you can slowly creep towards insects by holding down 'A'. I practiced that on other insects. Good. 

Then, finally, after a bit more playing we got our first tarantula. I used the new ""creep and pause"" tactic to get close enough - maybe taking a step or two more than I really needed to - and caught my tarantula.

I'm going to keep it for my museum that should open today even though that sucker was worth 8,000 bells. 

What a blast. Just wanted to share. :)",57,1585145714,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/foqzui/caught_my_first_tarantula_in_acnh_last_night_the/,NintendoSwitch,1

Patch 1.0.1 is out for the Switch version of the Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links Evolution.

What's new in the patch?  (Great question. What follows is based on previous news and testing. I'm having trouble finding a patch log.)

-New cards bringing the total to over 10,000.

-New duelists in the game.

-Extra deck monsters can now be played in the normal monster card zone. (I only had a chance to test Xyz before work, but assume it applies to all.)

-Card Pull rates appear to be significantly improved/changed. If I am still getting duplicates of cards after having 3 copies, it's significantly reduced. (For reference I was able to double the number of cards I had for two different packs after some quick point grinding.)

If anyone has a link to a page with the full patch notes I'll add it my post and make any changes necessary.

On top of the VentureBeat prediction that accurately called the Indie Direct last week, there have been a few listings, teases, data mines (ex: MUA3 has a new story mode dropping on the 26th, Panzer Dragoon Dev just teases major news dropping this week) that lead one to speculate that a Direct, at the very least, MIGHT have been planned to drop this week.  But of course many plans have changed throughout the world.  

If a Direct gets announced that’ll be exciting as always.  But even if a Direct does air this week, I would expect nebulous release dates for a ton of games, as release dates are highly in flux in
Sure given current events.  Also, Nintendo has a history of removing focus on any games that might be disturbing or triggers, so I wouldn’t be surprised if a game or two that they had planned to unveil or showcase is removed from a presentation.  I wouldn’t go in expecting too many horror game announcements, for instance.

fonpx7,GlobexCorpDrone,I know everyone is talking about Animal Crossing but...Pokemon Let's Go or Sword/Sheild?,"I've recently bought a switch, having not had a console for a long time (last one I owned was the original DS)! One of the main reasons for opting for the Switch over other consoles was because I'm a big fan of the pokemon game series. 

The original games (blue/red/yellow) and the 2nd gen (gold/silver) have always been my favourites. I've enjoyed games after that as well but always wanted the 1st gen pokemon to feature more.

That should mean Let's Go is ideal but the way you catch wild pokemon doesn't really appeal to me, I prefer the traditional gameplay style. 

Sword and Shield look decent, but I'm not sure if I want to learn a whole new generation of pokemon and would be slightly disappointed if I can't catch some of my old favourites like Kadabra, Gyarados and Haunter. 

I only really want to pick up one of these games for now as there are others I want to play as well (BotW, Smash Bros, etc...) so I guess my questions are: 

- Is the storyline and gameplay in Sword and Shield worth choosing this over Let's Go? 
- How much do 1st gen Pokemon feature in Sword and Shield? 
- Is the way you catch wild Pokemon in Let's Go annoying for fans of the classic games or is it not that big a deal? 
- What game did people prefer if they've played both? Particularly interested to hear from fans of those original games!",24,1585130311,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fonpx7/i_know_everyone_is_talking_about_animal_crossing/,NintendoSwitch,1

fomml3,macreno,PSA If you’re on the hunt for a switch,"I have been looking for a switch for over a week and today I was finally able to snag one, so I thought I would share how. I don’t know if this is just the area I live in (Phoenix) but a ton of Walmart stores near me got a small restock of normal red/blue switches in their stores. For some reason you have to click through a couple links to be able to see if locations near you are carrying them. First you have to search for the switch and it will probably be listed from one of their 3rd party sellers for over $450, click on it and go to the link that says “compare all sellers”, if you’re lucky, one of the sellers should be Walmart itself and it should have the switch listed at the normal price of $299. If it’s available near you it will show you which stores are carrying it, but it does not give you an option to do in store pick up, or to order it online. When I went to go get my switch in store today it was the 2nd to last one and the employee said they’re only selling one switch per family because they’re in such high demand. So go get them before they sell out! As of right now I just checked and 5 stores near me still have them in stock, so hopefully Walmart’s near you do too!",83,1585123980,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fomml3/psa_if_youre_on_the_hunt_for_a_switch/,NintendoSwitch,1

folo76,ImSuperCereus,"Opinion: ""A Knight's Quest"" Deserved a Physical Release. Does Anyone Agree?","This game is super unknown and negatively rated, but I still decided to buy it while it was on sale and I was surprised at how great it is. There are three big factors that I can clearly see negatively impacting the game and any one of these could be a reason why this eShop exclusive didn't get it's fair share of time in the limelight:

1. As cute and childish as the game is, its use of mildly foul language strips it of its change to get an E for Everyone rating. It's not bad for a game to be marketed for a mature audience, but it just feels like this game gains so little for the inclusion of mature language and loses such a big advantage in return; being marketable for all ages. 
2. It's not polished to perfection like most 3D games nowadays would be. With indie developers creating so many retro games these days, it's become a rarity to click on a title in the eShop and see a full on 3D world over a 2D one. Most 3D games come from large companies or at least indie developers that are making a bigger name for themselves. Sky9 Games is relatively small and unheard of, it's no surprise they can't make a game perfect, but that never stopped them from making it as large, engaging and exciting as they could. 
3. It comes off as very generic, and, to be fair, it is, but that never stops it from being fun. Even from the name, it's clear A Knight's Quest isn't going to be anything that stands out in its core structure. It takes a lot of inspiration from platformer genre with games such as Mario Odyssey or Yooka Laylee and the role playing genre with games like Legend of Zelda. You can check it out for yourself right now and there's probably not one thing in the game its developers thought of before any other game designer out there, but it still gives us this epic adventure to undertake and I think that's worth immortalizing with a physical release.",6,1585118526,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/folo76/opinion_a_knights_quest_deserved_a_physical/,NintendoSwitch,1

fole44,Jbx316x,PSA: Too many I've been hacked posts. Please read to protect yourself.,"As someone who had my Netflix account hacked over and over again I'm seeing alot of posts on Nintendo accounts getting hacked. The general advice is set up two factor authentication. But that's not going to stop the root cause of the problem. 

There's no point having 2FA if you're using the same passwords everywhere which is what you're probably doing. If they can't hack your Nintendo because it's got 2FA they'll hack something else of yours that doesn't. 

The biggest way to stop this happening is to use a unique password generator vault. Google has one built into its accounts. I use that and lastpass as a backup. 2FA those accounts and you're safe. No one's gonna hack you if you have a different password for each account and it looks like this #3Fs68£sD_A6kwb@. There are a number of password vaults out there to use. 

Use https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to check your email, if any accounts linked to that email have been breached and see where the data breach has come from. Set it up to alert you when another one happens. Really if your email is breached it's better to start with a fresh one and set alerts on that. 

This might sound like a huge headache to set up. Trust me once you start it feels amazing to know you're fixing all your online vunerable accounts. You'll save yourself a huge headache in the long run.",91,1585116944,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fole44/psa_too_many_ive_been_hacked_posts_please_read_to/,NintendoSwitch,1

Putting a large rubber band around my switch helps prevent the issue but it is really annoying to have that especially when I have connections to the dock on both sides (which makes it somewhat difficult to take off) and also the rubber band stretches to the point of it not working after a while.

So, I know the Pro controller eventually drifts as well, but I see that it’s not as likely, and it lasts a little longer. Some users even swear by it. Thoughts? Opinions? The price point is pretty high. And if it drifts after a couple months I don’t wanna bother with it.

For the first year abroad, the Switch was with me but I wasn’t really using it due to the time difference between my friends and I so for the last 6 months, I left my switch at home since it was going to help for luggage space and weight upon my final return.

Unfortunately the only person I trusted to take care of it was at the other side of the continent (my brother) and when I decided to leave it here, he had already left.

So I left the Switch at 50% charge and turned off the wifi to reduce battery use 6 months ago. It’s now been 45 mins and my Switch hasn’t turned on yet or shown any signs of life. Should I just leave it overnight and see what happens or is it a dud now?

My family recently got the Nintendo Switch, and we bought a bunch of games. Smash bros, untitled goose game, mario party, etc. They were purchased on my mom's nintendo account and we have only one switch in the house. All of my family members have linked their personal online nintendo accounts to hers. So right now, my nintendo account has a direct association with hers on this particular console.

I'm musing getting my own switch. They are leaving town for a while and I'd love to play, but they're taking the switch with them. However, I don't want to re-purchase all of those games if I can help it.

Is it possible to buy my own switch, log into my mom's account to access those games we bought on the family console so that they are on my personal console, and then play those games through my personal nintendo account that is linked with hers?

I imagine if this is possible, my console would technically be registered under her account, but I'd still like to play through my account that is actively linked to hers.

I hope this makes sense. I appreciate all of your guys' help!

fohcrb,AnonymousSkull,Connecting to islands in Animal Crossing New Horizons looks nice... but is implemented poorly.,"This is a bit of a rant. So far I’m enjoying the game a lot, despite some questionable changes that I’ve read about, like gold tools that break. The multiplayer issue on a single console is already well documented here, too. What I want to discuss is flying to other towns and getting visitors. 

I’m astounded by how poorly implemented the interface is for visiting other towns. It “looks nice”, but is slow and simply gets in the way of play. It gets even worse when multiple players group up on one island. And to be completely fair, I understand that Animal Crossing is all about delayed gratification. I’m not arguing about the fact that you still need to interact with the airport to fly somewhere instead of just opening your in-game phone and tapping to fly. Certain aspects of the game are in place for a reason and most of them make sense from a usability and story standpoint. I want to talk about what I feel is implemented poorly and takes me out of the simulation. 

To fly to a friend’s island, they have to be your friend on the Switch, and that’s a whole other can of worms that has been thoroughly discussed. When you begin to fly to their island, anyone on said island is immediately frozen so the “joining” animation can play out. This can take up to 45 seconds. If another player then wants to join, they have to keep interacting with Orville until they get the “all clear” to fly, then those two people on the island must once again wait for the new player to land. If you want to have a party, this could take 6 to 7 minutes. I’m gonna be honest, that’s bullshit for networking in 2010 and it’s even more bullshit for 2020. 

If you’re in the middle of catching a fish, even if you just spent some fish food to lure them, it disappears so you can wait for the joining animation to finish. If you’re mid-dialogue with a character, or crafting, or have your menu open, you’re asked to stop so the person can join. That person, on their screen, will usually have to ask Orville more than once to try flying again until it finally allows them to. Why is this a thing? The admittedly-cute ticker-style signage is cool, but man does it get old fast, especially when your game is put on hold for almost a minute for it. 

I’d argue that this implementation is poor at best. I think a better method for doing this would be to have an announcement near and edge of the screen and perhaps still use the ticket-style banner but allow the joined player to continue to interact with their environment as the other player joins. Simple and clean, still gets the point across, doesn’t halt gameplay. 

Once people are on your island, or you’re on their island, there’s no way of knowing where they are. By that I mean the map, which always shows where you are, doesn’t show where they are. Why not? Each player has a little NookPhone, surely their position is sharable? Instead you either need to rely on typing to ask where someone is, download an app on your personal phone (Switch Online app) and use voice chat there, or rely on something like Discord for voice chat. I do like Nintendo, and I’m glad they care about how we interact, especially with kids exposed to the internet, but holy hell is this frustrating. Why not just put a dot on the map showing players? Or better yet have a little name near it. When Destiny 2 had this issue, player dots were implemented pretty quickly and it wasn’t perfect but helped a lot with navigation and meetups. 

Look, I’m not here to beat a dead horse by talking about Nintendo and online interactions. It is what it is right now and hopefully things get better. But this is just another aspect of a really great game that could have made it even better and yet crippled the online experience. I should be excited to visit other islands! Instead I feel like I’m causing that islander a burden for me interrupting their play so they can sit through a pointless 45 second animation when it could have been done in the background like virtually every other online gaming system has for the last 20 years. 

So what are your thoughts? Did I go too far? Does Animal Crossing HAVE to be monotonous in every aspect? I don’t think it does, and clearly Nintendo feels the same way because there are many quality of life improvements in the game. I think they really dropped the ball on getting the online play right.",11,1585098720,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fohcrb/connecting_to_islands_in_animal_crossing_new/,NintendoSwitch,1

I’m curious about the Switch and how it works. I do have a Wii, but the problem is that I’ve never had a lot of manual dexterity or great spatial relations, so I found the Wiimote frustrating to use and never used it much. Aside from the Wii, the most recent console I’ve used is a PlayStation 2. 

So, how easy is it to use the Switch? Are the controllers easy to use? I grew up with side-scroller games, so are there any games that replicate that sort of experience? I’ve never played any of the Pokémon games, so would trying to get into the newest games just be a waste of time?

fofs9u,aboxofdeadrats,"If Pikmin 4 doesn't show up at this upcoming direct, it's officially vaporware","Up until now, there's consistantly been ""big releases"" that could have potentially resulted in Nintendo delaying the game, for fear of impacted sales. Now that all of the ""big series"" are up and active on the Switch, the only thing they could do would be to finally reveal their development hell projects (MP4, Bayo 3, and of course Pikmin 4), or reveal new bigs things... 

Why would they reveal a big thing if they still have so many projects on the backburner (that've been there for 3+ years)? It's rather simple- the games have been discarded, or simply never existed to begin with. 

This is, of course, assuming we're getting an upcoming direct. It's fairly likely- outside of the Xenoblade remake (which doesn't have much to show, being a graphical overhaul with a few new areas), Nintendo has no formally announced games with 2020 release dates. 

  
Rather frankley, I just want to get it out of my head- the game's been ""nearly completed"" since I was in middle school, and I'm graduating in 2 months. I just want the series to either get new life, or be formally dead.

Recently had our 3DS die and looking to get a replacement system in a switch lite. I've done my research on how to get the two set up as a primary/secondary system however had some questions on how to get certain digital games. On a secondary console, is it possible to purchase a 2nd copy of a game (say stardew valley) which would allow the game to be played OFFLINE so that my wife who travels and doesn't always have access to the net can still play a handful of her favorite games if she's not always connected?

I know we COULD make the switch lite the primary console, but then we run into the same problem except for me with the normal switch when I travel (which is as much as she does). I've done some high level searching and no obvious answers so figured I'd reach out here where I always see some great assistance!

TL;DR - Need to know how to let the wife access all the games she likes WITHOUT the internet on a secondary console. Preferably just buy buying a second digital copy!

I am in the national guard in a unit where we are activated for a month minimum with a quarantine afterwards minimum and that leaves me far from home so it’s the barracks life for me. I have a few questions about the switch if anybody has the time to respond. 

I’ll just start here
* I’ve seen that the switch connects to a tv or something like that, is it good as a stand-alone device also, I’m thinking it can be played as something of a PsP but I’m not sure.

*I will likely try to find one on Craigslist or somewhere cheaper as the new ones are pretty pricey. But meals are provided here so I’m not too worried about spending a big chunk of change if I absolutely need to. I’d like to avoid it. Is there anything I should look for to make sure I’m not being ripped off in this case? I don’t know anything about the different models or what they’ll potentially go for

*Can I boot up the switch and play these single player games such as animal crossing, Zelda (I’m excited to try this one, super smash bro’s, etc with no internet connection at all. The cell service alone here is very dodgy

*Any game suggestions that I will really enjoy on the device alone playing in my bunk? 


*Any tips or tricks I should know? I really don’t know anything about this device and I’m really excited to try something new but don’t want to get in over my head, not be able to use it to it’s full potential, or get screwed over.


Thank you so much to anyone that is willing to help, please stay self quarantined on your switch until all of this blows over.

I also remember losing about 20k to 30k bells when I played yesterday (again right after my sister), but I shrugged that off because I didn't think she would do it.

I logged onto her account to check how many bells she's acquired, and she has about 130k bells in her bank, which seems absurd seeing as how she just paid back her 98k bells house loan a couple of hours ago, and we're very early game.

I am currently in the process of asking my switch friends over Discord if they have seen my account go online anytime today, but none of them remember much. Is there any other ideas you guys have for me to check if anything is going on? I really don't want to make a big deal about it if it isn't her and overall a hundred thousand bells or so isn't that much to me, but I don't want to keep letting her steal with no repercussions if it is her, so I'd rather find some definitive proof.

So basically I'll have my gates open and  trying to invite people over and multiple different people get an error saying they can't connect to my console. The error codes are 2618-0513 and 2618-0521. Turned my switch on and off, sometimes that helps. Going to their town, then me opening my gates sometimes helps. I've played other online games and was able to connect with the same friends without issues, and I've had this same error on different internet's with different routers. Except the error message is not on my switch, it's on theirs. But they can play with other people without issues, it only happens when they try to connect with me.

Nintendo suggested doing portforewarding, but my router doesn't show it's IP and the one we found isn't working. My internet provider also isn't really answering right now, so I'm stuck.

fodnnk,VitorOfHyrule,"We need a secondary market for digital games on the eShop! It's baffling that Nintendo hasn't given us this, and what a P2P market could do for digital gaming.","Let me start by saying that I much prefer digital games to physical games overall. Not having to worry about my dog or toddler swallowing the tiny cartridge, having most of my full library with me when I travel or commute, the quickness to get access to the game, I think it's all delightful. Much superior experience, in my personal experience. I don't care for collecting or having a cool looking shelf with all my cases, and stuff. 

BUT, I tend to buy AAA titles physically. Super Mario Odyssey, Breath of the Wild, Witcher 3, Super Mario Maker 3, Bayonetta 1+2 (is this AAA, or just priced like it?). I have these physically, even though I hate swapping cartridges. Why? One reason: these have higher **resale value**. 

I think this may be the one big thing holding back more people from going digital with their games. Nintendo titles are expensive. $60 dollars for one game, plus paid DLC, amounts to a pretty penny. 

Let me bring some data about my collection (big thanks to [dekudeals.com](https://dekudeals.com) for helping me track my spend and my collection as a whole):

* My entire collection at MSRP is worth $ 2,044.13, for 90 items (85 games+5 DLC)
* I paid $ 1,157.1 for it, so far (I bargain hunt a lot, wait for sales and count gold point purchases as $ 0)
* I have abandoned 31 of those games, roughly 36% of games and 30% of the spend
* That is $ 626  just sitting in my library, not doing anything for me or anyone else 

If there was a secondary market, I would be able to recover some of that money and re-apply it to more games. How? Well, these are my proposed rules for this market: 

1. All games games must sell at 80% of current price (either 80% of MSRP or 80% of sale price), so there is incentive to browse through the ""digitally refurbished"" catalog instead of the regular eShop
2. You can only sell or buy from the secondary market if you have an active Nintendo Switch account, adding extra value to the subscription
3. You get 60% of the money, Nintendo and the developer split the rest, to pay for the infrastructure and reward the developer
4. The maximum you can earn from the sale is what 95% of what you paid for it, so people don't profiteer from buying games on heavy discounted sale and putting them up for the secondary market. If there is a difference, i.e. you bought NBA 2K19 for $ 2.99 on the E3 sale last year, and sold it for 80% of the $ 59.99 it's selling for now, you get $ 2.84, the rest go to Nintendo and the publisher/developer
5. The money is converted into gold points, that expire after 1 year, and can only be spent on the eshop, fueling new purchases
6. The system will automatically erase the game from your account and allow the buyer to download
7. The browsing of available games would be in the eShop, in a special area, available only to NSO subscribers

I think these rules seem fair, incentivize people to sell unwanted games or games they don't want to play anymore, and gives people access to cheaper games, while rewarding Nintendo and game developers. 

I think having a secondary market in house for digital games would make people feel a lot more comfortable buying digital games, and help develop the digital market as a whole. It also adds value to the Nintendo Switch Online service, which Nintendo obviously wants to incentivize. 

Thanks for reading the long post, and please let me know what you think of my ideas for this service. Would you be interested in buying more digital games if you could resell them safely?",30,1585085495,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fodnnk/we_need_a_secondary_market_for_digital_games_on/,NintendoSwitch,1

fodjt8,maximumhamburgers,Improvement suggestions for AC:NH Multiplayer,"I've been playing the past 4 days local coop, and here are my complaints and suggestions to the Animal Crossing dev team. Some of these complaints are just general complaints.

- All players should have full access to their inventory and their tool wheel. The fact that we have to switch players by shaking the controller just makes this an inconvenience. Also it makes zero sense... when you're player 2, your d-pad is completely unused and you're regulated to using one button to switch between tools. This is a huge pain in the ass when you have to switch between pole vault and ladder constantly to navigate the island.
- Don't preventing player 2 from performing tool switches or other actions while player 1 has a menu open. So many times player 1 will be switching over to a fishing rod while I'm fishing. Just the act of player 1 opening their menu cancels my action and sometimes ruins whatever I was just trying to catch! This is so frustrating and should be better. Or if player 1 is getting out a ladder/pole vault, now I have to wait until they are done to pull out my own tool... and if you hit the X button one more time than you should, then you have to cycle through ALL of your tools again. The only exception to this rule I can think of is NPC dialogue boxes.
- Player 2 can't hold musical instruments or slingshots... just a weird limitation. Maybe it was based on them knowing tool switching was tedious for player 2... but then why not just let us use the Dpad and have tool wheel access? If we don't get our inventory access at least give us that!
- Player 2 plays that stupid animation every single time you pick something up. This makes actually grabbing items a huge pain. Also these items would be better off just going into my own inventory rather than the recycling bin. In a few cases we've used this strategically, however this just makes me wish they had developed this a bit further so any player could pick between putting picked up items into their inventory or recycling bin... Maybe use the completely unused + button to toggle.
Player 2 should be able to interact with NPCs. Self explanatory.

- Every time a player joins an online game, everyone has to watch this long-ass cutscene. What other game does this? It takes so damn long for a player to join/leave. Why couldn't it just be seamless drop in/drop out? Animal Crossing devs could have learned quite a bit from games like Minecraft here. I get it that they want the 'Experience' and want to help people feel like they are special for arriving, but even a quick banner at the top of the screen would have been miles better. Making everyone on the server (up to 8 people) stop to wait for ONE person to join is a pain in the ass. Repeat this step 7 times if you want to go bald early.

- Not able to place items while playing online. I'm not sure if this extends to terraforming as well, but I assume it might... just another limitation I don't quite understand. You can place items in your home while playing online, just not on the island itself. Animal Crossing really missed out the opportunity to have friends help you customize your island online.

_______
Overall I'm enjoying the game, but these are some big sore spots which I hope get improved. Knowing Nintendo, this is probably just going to be the way it is and I'll have to deal with it. In the offchance that other people share these gripes maybe Nintendo will make some changes.
_______
Now for some less likely improvements but some I'd like to see

- Player 2 should be able to join player 1 on Nook Mile trips. Just another weird limitation I don't quite understand. If the complaint is about abusing one Nook Mile ticket... require each player to have one. It can be done and it should be done.
- Player 2 should be able to join player 1 in online gameplay. Especially with the limited options present. If they aren't going to grant local coop players full inventory and put all these weird limitations, at least let us tag along to other locations.",2,1585085144,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fodjt8/improvement_suggestions_for_acnh_multiplayer/,NintendoSwitch,1

They did a pokemon one which is great and i love mine but i feel like they could have made a killing with some fire emblem three houses editions. They could have done one for each house and/or one for church of seiros they had so many options on just that game alone. I dont get it. Is it really that difficult to get them together or is it just that extremely unprofitable?? I just wish they had more cool options instead of lame shit like coral and turquoise... the original colors are stale and basic.,5,1585084973,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fodhvq/limited_edition/,NintendoSwitch,1

fodcl5,bobbyharmless,AT&amp;T LTE with Netgear M1; Possible to ever change from NAT Type D?,"Hey everyone,

I know this question has been asked in different ways. I've read through all of them here on Reddit, tried all solutions, and tracked with what I've seen on a few other forums, too. So before I give a description of my own set up, I thought I'd link to what I *have* tried so we can avoid multiple references :).

**NOTE:** I've removed some of the links because one (I don't know which) were universally banned by Reddit so I've tried to leave up the ones that seem harmless though none are NSFW or anything like that. 🤷🏻‍♂️

**I've reviewed, tried, and completed** (all with no avail):

* [NAT D on AT&amp;T Mobile Solution for wifi hotspots](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6n3h3w/nat_d_on_att_mobile_solution_for_wifi_hotspots/)
* [Finally fixed my NAT type D issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/amn7e9/finally_fixed_my_nat_type_d_issue/)
* Error Code: 2618-0516
* Troubleshooting Issues Related to NAT
* How to Fix NAT Type D Error for Nintendo Switch on AT&amp;T Mobile Hotspot
* NAT Type Issue For Nintendo Switch

That said, **my current set up** is as follows:

* AT&amp;T Hotspot (from which, I understand, the NAT type is set by the carrier)
* [Netgear Nighthawk M1](https://www.netgear.com/landings/nighthawk-mr1100-mobile-router/) set as a modem with DHCP passthrough
* [TP-Link Deco P9](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/deco/deco-p9(3-pack)/) Mesh Network that broadcasts WiFi over the house
* MacBook Pro (which I only bring up because I'm aware of utilities like Connectify)
* Cloudflare DNS
* An ExpressVPN account

Ultimately, I'm looking for a solution that would allow me to utilize the hardware (and/or software) on my network - even if that includes using a VPN - to attempt to achieve a better NAT. Is this even possible?

If so, have you been successful and can you share your configuration?",8,1585084490,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fodcl5/att_lte_with_netgear_m1_possible_to_ever_change/,NintendoSwitch,1

Well, outside of the way people talk about Smash Bros here and other subs, many think Sakurai work on Nintendo (when he never did), people really think Nintendo develop the game (when they never did) and I think the biggest argument is the online, which people makes arguments comparing it to other titles but... Nintendo don't develop those games. For example, since online began to exist, the ones developing Smash Bros have been.. Bandai Namco Studios.

Like, I get it, most people even between the most hardcore for some reason thinks that Nintendo develop everything they publish but still, I would think that people would know the companies who develop those games, as I see that happening on most cases out there for other companies, but for some reason with Nintendo, outside of cases like Mario&amp;Luigi, Pokémon mainline and Fire Emblem where the development company is recognized many times, we don't see the same on other cases.",26,1585077462,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fob6rn/do_people_really_think_that_nintendo_develop/,NintendoSwitch,1

\- Once the game reinstalls on the sd card, will my save still be there?

\- Am I able to transfer the game save from the SD card to the system storage or a new SD card?

I played through pretty casually, and on an easier mode, so I didn’t get a detailed look on what skills may or may not have been working accurately. But I did experience the entirety of the game, save for one major glitch that I ran into on the final boss.

So for an update from my experience: the game still crashes constantly (I turned off auto-save and it seemed to help at times). I fought through the crashes and was able to push through both White March 1 &amp; 2. I made it all the way to the final boss in the main storyline and was able to defeat him, but the game glitched out on me (I’ve tried multiple ways to make this work, still to no avail).

The Witcher: the game that had me stop gaming. It was so deep and rich I had to choose between real life obligations or having to explain to a villager why I released a witch. Now with no outside obligations well....




Zelda botw: this just occurred to me that I haven’t played a full Zelda game since OoT.  How is this game REALLY?  Couple of years past the hype what do you guys feel about it 



Pokémon mystery team: played the demo and loved it loved it loved it. But I’m coming off diablo 3 dungeon crawling intensity. It’s adorable, loved the questions that made me immediately love my Pokémon character and friends. 



Finally animal crossing. Never played an animal crossing game but played star dew valley. Seems like a game I can’t grab but seems like a daily thing.

I have Switch A (original switch) and Switch B (new switch). I'm giving Switch A to a friend. I would like to move my profile and saves to Switch B. (Yes I know I can't do this for Animal Crossing, that's not my issue)


I have a NSO connected profile on both switches and want to keep both profiles (one is set to another region). So I want to move A's data to B and keep B's data still in tact.


My main confusion is transferring save data for pokemon? What I have been reading states:
A) ""when you transfer a profile, you don't have access to your save data on the original switch anymore""
B) ""pokemon save data has to be transferred manually between two switches linked to the same Nintendo account""


What is the course of action here? Can I create a new profile on B, link the same Nintendo account from A to it, manually transfer the save data, and then change B to the primary switch for account A? Then safe to wipe A? Because it sounds like doing a system transfer could cause some issues.

Never played one before but it's real difficult to not let the hype train hit and trail with ya... So I am almost convinced that I am going to buy in order to play with my SO.

Regarding that I've been reading that people are not happy with being the side kick 2nd character... And it kinda puts me off - there is no way to know who will be more appealed by the game and will spend more time.

For those who already play it multiple users on one system: **does it make sense to choose a neutral account as primary and if we play together one gets to be the primary and then each of us is an inhabitant more using out personal accounts?

I personally hate playing with the straps on both joy cons in docked mode, they make both joy cons wider and harder to grip. With them off I can grip the joy cons properly.

I wanna like the game because everyone is hyping it up and saying how great it is, I don't have the patience to sit and play it more than 20 minutes. I just walk around picking up sticks. Tried fishing but never able to catch anything, can't say I cared for the way fishing works in this game. The 2 animals in my town are so dull.

fo499a,TheDrawingSparrow,Amazon upscaling and everywhere is sold out.,"Yesterday was a crazy day for me! I decided a few weeks ago that I wanted a Switch, but didnt get the money until yesterday. EVERYWHERE was sold out. I went to two different Walmarts, looked online at Target, Ebay, Best Buy, called a few local Game Stops, and even looked up international stores. Amazon had marked the grey switch to up over $430, and by the time I could click on the regular priced red and blue switch, it had been marked up as well! On top of that it wouldnt even arrive until April 21st.

Finally, after looking for 5 hours, I found a GameStop that had one refurbished v1 switch in stock. I raced to the store and just managed to get there 5 minutes before they closed. Due to COVID-19 they werent taking cash or debit cards (only credit cards with a chip). Well I only had a debit card. My loving bf, who had been with me through all of this, (and recently gotten his tax return) pulls out a wad of money and tells the clerks that he would pay them the price of the Switch in cash plus a little extra if they had a credit card that we could buy it on. We were desperate at this point. The two clerks looked at each other before one finally decided to run my debit card to pay for it. I just managed to squeak by with the last Switch within 2 full cities and online! 

The point of this is, who knew COVID-19 would have such a huge impact on a gaming console? Who else has struggled to find a Switch? Is this the same everywhere?",16,1585052701,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fo499a/amazon_upscaling_and_everywhere_is_sold_out/,NintendoSwitch,1
fo44q3,AJBowyer,Dropped my switch...Help?,"So yesterday I dropped my switch.

It fell from about 4ft onto my hardwood floor.

Luckily everything seemed fine except the left joycon was bend upwards and I had to bend back the rail on the remote to get it to feel like it was more properly aligned.  I intend to buy new joycons as when I flip my right controller around it fits fine and feels normal versus the left joycon that took the hit and seems to still have a slight curvature to it. (it also feels weird when I put in the free controller thing that comes with the switch) 

Upon further investigation, I noticed the inner rail on the left side of the switch itches now eclipses part of the frame. 

The right side console rail does not protrude so that is what raises my concern.

I have attached a picture to best try to show what I think is an issue.

 I also realized on both controllers there is a very slight almost unnoticeable gap towards the top of the console on the left side where the joycon meets the actual console. While playing games I wouldn't notice this but the slightly protruding rail on the actual console leads me to believe that is what's causing the super minimal gap. 

Is this something I can fix at home somehow or does this need to go to the Nintendo doctors.

I just got off a 10hour shift so pardon the mental blurp. I just really rely on my switch to decompress especially during Los Angeles quarantine.

I left my ACNH save and stayed into the home menu, put the Switch in sleep mode, and then played the game 14 hours later. I tried to start my save again but it did not work. The game seemed to be unresponding (black screen without the island icon). The moron that I am closed the game. But it worsened the problem.

I tried to boot the game but I was met with a black screen and an unresponding game. I feared that my save would have disappeared. But actually, in some cases, it seems that the game could take up to 2 minutes to perform some operations in the ""right-after the boot"" period. Let the game do what it wants to do, even if the screen stays fully black.
In my case, 2 minutes of black screen and the island icon reappeared in the bottom-right corner. And my save launched normally. An happy ending at least.

Trying  to save money with the Corona virus stuff going around and had to  decide between DOOM and Animal Crossing. Even though DOOM was higher on  my priority list, I ended up going with Animal Crossing only because it  was a game that both me and my wife could enjoy, while DOOM is not her  type of game at all and I was sure she wouldn't like it.

&amp;#x200B;

So  I bought AC hoping to enjoy the game with her and, to my great  disappointment, not only is the multiplayer completely pointless, but so  is the entire game if you're not the first person to open it. It's  ridiculous enough that you cannot create your own island and are forced  to play on someone else's, but to have it so that you can make  absolutely no progress and do nothing other than run around catching  fish, bugs and shaking trees is just unacceptable.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have never seen a game like this, where it forces you to buy an entire  new console if you want to play the full game. Seriously hope Nintendo  releases a patch that allows you to have the full experience and to  create your own island and also make progress on someone else's if you  choose to play that way, otherwise I guess I'm stuck waiting for my wife  to be done with the game so I can have a turn.",54,1585051333,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fo3ytz/seriously_disappointed_with_animal_crossing_new/,NintendoSwitch,1

fo3pzp,Myroyes2,My idea for a “Switch Pro”,"Nintendo has stated that the “Switch” is a family of consoles meaning that not each console needs to adhere to the “switching” mechanic. They already proved this with the Switch Lite which cannot be docked and is handheld only. Ever since the Switch released there have been rumors of a potential Switch Pro and it seems like many people would be interested in a more powerful system from Nintendo. Here’s what I would like to see from a potential Switch Pro.

The Super Nintendo Switch
- Has Cartridge Slot for All Switch Games
- TV Mode Only
- Native 4K Output for video streaming
- 4K Upscaling for current Switch Games
- Uncapped Frame rates
- Greatly Increased Internal Storage 
- Dedicated USB 3.0, Ethernet, USB-C Ports
- External Storage Support
- Bundled with Pro Controller
- Release alongside BOTW II OR Metroid Prime 4
- MSRP $399

I think this would be a great addition to the Switch Family and many people would want to get their hands on one to experience games like Breath of the Wild in 4K or with higher frame rates.

Just also thinking graphics wise the switch should be able to handle Far Cry Primal (with downgraded graphics) Far Cry 4 and the earlier games. I for one have always been on the fence of buying Ubisofts games but if they released ports on Switch with say, motion controls for aiming, ID BUY INSTANTLY

What do you guys think? Considering we got a port of Witcher 3, getting ports of Far Cry (smaller ingame worlds I think) should be possible?",15,1585049114,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fo3jle/id_love_some_more_ubisoft_games_on_the_nintendo/,NintendoSwitch,1

I’ve done everything except factory reset my switch, which I really don’t want to do.

I am lookikg to try and find a good headset for my gielfriend to use. She has been after one for a while for regular pc use, but I would ideally like to get her one which can be also used on the switch while docked. This is mainly since realising that the footsteps and fishing noises on animal crossing are louder than an average car horn.

In the past I had some success using a standard PS4 gold wireless headset with the switch, however she uses discord to chat with friends while playing switch. So does anyone know ofna headset which I could connect to switch gane audio via bluetooth, while aimultaneously connectinng to a pc/mobile device for discord?

1. FFX / X-2 bundle: never had a chance to play them
2. FF7 : just because of the tag price, 7.99. Kinda played it but it mostly me watching my older brother play on the sideline

Considering:
1. FF9 : because of the price too. Was able to play 75%, was already allowed to push buttons when it was released (but big bro played Disk 3 by himself 😭). But I’ve been reading bad reviews with bugs.

Not really
1. FF8 : not really sure. Played until Disk 1 ending, Disk 2 was nowhere to be found. LOL. Still finds 9 and 7 better except for the music

I already have Octopath, so not looking at DQ 1-3 or Romancing Saga.

fo15ta,BramborovyKnedlicek,Switch lite drift - a reason not to buy it or no?,"Okay so I’m 99% decided to get the yellow Lite (in my country it costs half as much as the regular switch). However I’m a little worried by the stick drift reports. Due to the coronavirus, going back to the store for replacement unit would be difficult and Nintendo doesn’t have a repair service here. So my question is: is the drift still an issue? I’m very gentle with my electronics, will use the switch lite at home, I have small hands (girl) and have not broken a controller yet (I only ever used Ps4 before tho - this would be my first ever nintendo).  I would get a case for it to protect it from dust when I don’t play.

Buying the regular switch is not an option for me, it costs twice as much and so far I only plan to play three games on it (minecraft, dark souls, animal crossing).",1,1585035992,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fo15ta/switch_lite_drift_a_reason_not_to_buy_it_or_no/,NintendoSwitch,1

fo11nq,Caturday84,My Experience with ACNH with My Wife,"I just wanted to share my experience. In short I love it and so does my wife. I am player 1 and she is 2.

****Regarding Tool Shortage****
The tools you can just give to the partner. Very quickly she bought the receipes for all the basic tools.

Right now after 3 days there a few things that only I can make right now...but she has her own DIY that she earned that I can't make. We just trade or make presents for each other. Little surprises make the game everything when I log in from WFH.


The builds needed for the 3 houses just require communicating with each other...maybe make a list and work together.


We make decisions on locations. It's all about communication and sharing the island we have. She has her corner I have mine...we have a common resource collective in the middle of the island.


She doesn't like to donate to the museum so now everyday I get an itemized bill from her about how much I owe based on what she would have gotten if she had sold it. Lol And I can pay it back in fish food or raw bells.


My wife has turned into loan shark worse than Tom Nook!


TLDR: Just work together...and communicate. Also watch out...your player 2 may end up being the boss and you are just a worker bee for the collective. &lt;3",54,1585035296,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fo11nq/my_experience_with_acnh_with_my_wife/,NintendoSwitch,1

So what I did for those who might have the same issue I do was got an old 360 controller(one that gave out on me years ago), crack that baby open and removed the rumble motors and pop opened my power a controller and inserted them right in! Apparently I didn’t know this so don’t judge me lol but the power a controller was designed in mind to be modified for those who later on can actually add the rumble feature so when opening up the controller it has two slots for rumble motors to squeeze in smooth as butter!

fnyn0i,KevinDL,I know everyone is in love with Animal Crossing right now... but can we talk about how superficial the online multiplayer feels in comparison to other games in the same genre?,"I love the game, but I feel like it should have been so much more after experiencing games like Stardew Valley where multiple people can build up the same farm together without any restrictions.  

Animal Crossing is without a doubt a great single player game... but I had bought two copies hoping my GF and I would have something to play together, and frankly with all the restrictions on gameplay while visiting another island *(Even as best friends)* the game simply loses all of the charm it has while in single player mode.  Sure, we can mess around with the little things while on each other islands... but there is no living on the same island or working together towards a common goal that to me makes the online worthwhile.  

I am expecting to get some heat for this thought process... but it is what it is.  To me the multiplayer component of the game is shallow, and I shouldn't be feeling that way given how many ""build together"" type games have been created over the past few years.

\---------------------

Just disappointed and wanted to vent my feelings on the subject.  My GF is relatively new to gaming and this was meant to be the game we play together to get us through the next few weeks of potential isolation due to the global pandemic.  I'll have to consider other options... though for now she seems to be enjoying the game in single player.",285,1585023049,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnyn0i/i_know_everyone_is_in_love_with_animal_crossing/,NintendoSwitch,1

fnwzkq,WarnedOregano,People pointing out the flaws in the AC:NH single island system aren't trying to detract from how much you enjoy the game.,"AC:NH is a fantastic game. I bought it on release and my wife has been logging some serious hours in it. Typically with video games she gets frustrated at her lack of skills and quits, but with AC:NH she just giggles every time she swings her net into a tree instead of shaking it.

I was excited to play the game that I watched her enjoy for the first few hours she played it, but instead I was dropped into _her_ game instead of one of my own. I had no say in the name or layout of the island or where any buildings went. I had buy essential DIY recipes she got for free after she unlocked them. I wasn't able to directly contribute resources to anything that was being built. So, I got to fish, catch bugs and gather resources.

If you're reading this, _my dissatisfaction with the game should have no affect on how much you enjoy it_. Whether you're the only one playing on your console, or you don't mind the limitation, if you're enjoying the game then I don't want this post to change that. Before you jump to defend the decision, think about the parent/child/sibling/spouse that isn't enjoying the game as much as somebody else in their household. Consider whether commenting something like ""it's a staple of AC games"" should really make a difference to somebody that isn't enjoying _this_ AC game.

And on that note, is this particular situation really a staple of these games? The previous games were never limited to one town per console, so you could have your own town for the cost of a second copy of the game or another memory card. Now, you have to spend $300 on another console.",156,1585015983,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnwzkq/people_pointing_out_the_flaws_in_the_acnh_single/,NintendoSwitch,1

fnw9dq,Dsb0208,A fun idea to implement challenges,"Nintendo should implement challenges into the Nintendo switch. There are game specific ones, where when you get them, it gives a little notification similar to when it says a friend is online, and from then you can see it in a “challenged page” in the same are as the Eshop and the images, the little dots at the bottom. The challenges page is like a calendar, showing the days the challenge was completed, similar to the feather in smash bro’s, where you could see your accomplishments. These accomplishments would be baked into games, and the only thing Nintendo has to do in terms of the console it’s self for these accomplishments would be add in the text and an image for the game. These game accomplishments would likely be mostly first party, but also include some other big names like dragon quest, doom etc. Something in particular I want to see is either beating, or 100% completing a game gets you a theme for your home menu (similar to the 3ds, cause I really liked this, and I think they should bring it back)

The bigger feature, that’s most likely never going to happen, but would be cool are console accomplishments. These would be seen in a separate page in the challenges menu, acceding then would be as simple as pressing the R bumper (or trigger), and going back would be pressing the L  bumper (or trigger). These accomplishments would be stuff like “download a first party game for the first time” “100% complete a game for the first time” “100% complete a (S)NES online classic game for the first time”. There would be less of these challenges, but in return these actually help the player, by gifting them gold points to use in the Eshop. An average reward would get you 500 coins ($5). I really can’t see Nintendo doing anything more than $5, but it’s still something that helps out everyone. In order to get this money, you’d have to be spending, and in most cases completing games, so Nintendo is gaining $60 for a standard game, and giving back $5 for you to be constantly playing that game, which will in the end get them some more publicity since people will talk about their games more, if they play end up completing more. 

Even if Nintendo sees that as too much of a loss, giving up to $5, 15% percent of the amount a game makes, they might make console rewards exclusive to Nintendo switch online members, as  that just seems like something Nintendo would do. This way they’re only paying back a fraction of people, the people who A. Have switch online and B. 100% complete games on the regular, so basically it’s a smart way to maybe boost Switch online memberships, and reward the players to try to ge them to play their games more",3,1585013092,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnw9dq/a_fun_idea_to_implement_challenges/,NintendoSwitch,1

- Megaman Zero/ZX collection
- River City Girls + Super Crush K.O.
- Exit the Dungeon + Risk of Rain 2

- one of the aforementioned cheaper games + saving the rest for an impulse purchase

It's not lost on me that a lot of these fit the bill, I just know that some of these are on sale, and might not be on sale as often or for as much, hence my decision paralysis

I’m having an issue with my Nintendo Switch, and the Nintendo repair centers are closed so I feel like it’s up to me to fix it. I think my Switch’s fan has an issue. The system, at least when docked, heats up quickly and is forced to enter sleep mode; additionally, the vent on the top of the system makes weird buzzing noises, as if the fan is stuttering or is clogged. I need to order a Tri-Wing screwdriver to take it apart and investigate, but I also considered using compressed air into the vent to clean out any dust, but I didn’t know if that was safe. My question is - can I shoot compressed air into the vent on top to see if it fixes my issue, or will that damage parts inside my system? If so, what’s the best way to approach my issue?

fntrcv,Hagure_Metal,Just purchased Animal Crossing or another $60 game? This is what you can do today with your Gold points!,"You just bought your shiny new game and acquired +300 points... I know what you might be thinking: Redeem them as part of your next game or spend them. There's nothing wrong with the option you choose but I really recommend you to spend them, since there are heavy discounts out there because of COVID-19.

Though are no big ""wow"" discounts at the moment at the eShop, there's two games that in my opinion are totally worth the 300 gold points ($3) that stand among the rest: Pikuniku and Runner3.

Pikuniku (at $1 now) is a game published by Devolver Digital, a mix between an Adventure Game and Puzzle solving. It gained some popularity and it has positive ratings at Metacritic. had a couple of discounts in the past but this one is the biggest yet. It's also available at Xbox Game Pass and it's free on steam for a couple days

Runner3 (at $2 now) is the third game of the Runner franchise, it's a rhythm-platforming game, has a lot of personality (Charles Martinet is the narrator and also a character in the game), to me is the Dark Souls of rhythm games because of it's punishing difficulty, but hey, their latest patch allows you to fix that if you're not comfortable with that. Also it has good reviews on Metacritic.

Even with their genres might be unappealing to you, I can't really recommend them enough! Give them a try! You might really like them.

To be honest, I tried to post this once but got removed (dunno why really, it's even posted in some sites but anyway)... so here I am, trying my luck again because I think it's worth sharing this with the community.",5,1585003717,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fntrcv/just_purchased_animal_crossing_or_another_60_game/,NintendoSwitch,1

  I did some research and found a bunch of different answers; some still say that every single island is supposed to have a villager on it, some say that you will always see villagers unless your own island is at a maximum capacity of 10 villagers, some say it's random and to keep trying, some briefly mention a ""recruiter"" task, etc.

 Basically just looking for any ideas as to whether it's still worth spending miles on mystery island tours or if I need to wait for all of the 3 villagers to finish moving in/if I need to do something to unlock the recruiter task.

fnqp71,ex0ll,Animal Crossing New Horizons: My Disappointment,"I'm *disappointed*.

I'm genuinely disappointed with Nintendo, just like a little kid on a tantrum. That is, for the level of affection I nurture towards the company.

I'm upset a game like this, given funds of an AAA+ game industry brand and 2020 videogames technology, proves disasterful under such features:

&gt;**Local Multiplayer**

So annoying when it comes to local multiplayer. An all hat and no cattle mode where only the leader can actually do something, and you have to spam-switch it in order to actually be able to do whatever, still taking turns. Otherwise, ranging from capturing fishes and bugs to crafting, you just have to stand there and watch, only being able to walk circles.

Honestly?

I prefered if a local co-op wouldn't exist at all, at least we wouldn't be made fun of.

&gt;**Poor Item Management &amp; Crafting Stacking**

Incredible how a 2020 social-crafting sim, with titles out there such as Stardew Valley (made by a random indie guy I'd like to underlight) or even Minecraft (who's dated back to 2009 now), WILL NOT allow you to craft multiple items at once or actually let you properly manage item stacks in your inventory. It grows really annoying as it forces you onto repeated actions over and over and over again.

&gt;**Online Action Restrictions**

I have no words either when it comes to how you just genuinely are unable to move stuff in your village or modify your own house and move furniture when literally any other game offers you any single player feature access-free and in real time. What's the point in limiting such actions? Nintendo already cripples off their multiplayer by putting stone walls through friend codes, p2p, and best friend filter; so once past all of those safety steps, why would someone still not be able to play the online with the same freedom you've got in single player?

How would you justify that, and most of all: WHY?

&gt;**No Real Island Backup &amp; Transfer Services**

Just like stated by Nintendo itself in one of their official videos, there's no real data backup and transfer from Switch to Switch, meaning that if you're already wrestling with your siblings over your Nintendo Switch and god forbids you make the insane consideration of purchasing A WHOLE NEW SWITCH CONSOLE for you to actually have some peace and enjoy some gameplay instead of being frustrated and force yourself to fight over who's the leader, Nintendo won't even let you decide who gets the current village and hence all the data is entirely locked down to that single device wether you like it or not.

**Conclusion:**

I know most of ACNH community sugar-coatedly whiteknights Nintendo and won't accept any kind of critic, but I feel compelled to spit out the truth that Nintendo just make such dumb moves and literally cripples its own potential in basically any kind of field.

Every single step I take I realize the game is disappointing, and despite that there's that formula down to the core that makes you keep playing. I hate all of this, cause it's literally something that could be perfect and instead deliberately makes you so mad for such stupid things.

Just wanted to share my 2 cents on my whole experience so far with all of you, I also realize not everyone cares or has to share their own console with brothers and sisters and so much on.

*EXTRA:*  
I'm posting this here cause the main AC subreddit automatically deletes my post for literally no reason at all.

The nintendo site is kind of confusing.  So far this is what I've figured out:

&amp;#x200B;

1) set up a nintendo account - ok check, everyone does this

2) sign up for online - no problem ($20 a year per kid I guess)

3) download a smartphone app? - Huh?  just to talk?  Now it's getting weird.  Do they each need their own phone just to talk to their friends?  

4) ... - and... there's nothing.  How does it work?  How do they talk to friends?  

&amp;#x200B;

fnpml4,tapdancingtommy7,"Given we're all stuck inside for awhile, what are some games that have a high value? AKA games with a low cost, but provide tons of hours of gameplay!","I thought it would be good to have a thread (even if it's outside normal submission rules) where we can share some games we could recommend that have a relatively low price, but could provide 100s of hours of gameplay. These are not always the ""best"" games in the traditional sense, but are good enough, and have high replay values. For example, I would give Luigis Mansion 3 my game of the year vote last year, but it isn't going to give me more than 40 hours of gameplay (and that's ok!). Here are some suggestions from my collection, but please share any of yours!

 • Farm Together. Eshop game in the $15 range. I consider this the farming version of Animal Crossing. Not as charming, but a polished, accessible for anyone, intentionally grindy farm/life sim. It contains real time gameplay elements, so much customization of farms and houses, and online play (and events) with friends or random farms.

 • Civilization 6. Frequently in the $15-$20 range, but can really be a time killer as we all know. Has a table top style to it that can really have a ""one more turn"" feel to keep you busy.

 • Cities Skylines, on sale for $10. Not a perfect port by any means, but plays well enough, and is the best city designing simulation series of the last 15 years.

 • Nine Parchments, $20 but frequently much less (I paid $6). A lighter but addicting Diablo 3/Darksiders type game that has high replay value that managed to get me hooked for 100s of hours. Contains online and local coop for 4 players.

 • Light Fingers, $20. An addicting board game esque competitive game. Great for local play. Note, only get if you have someone to play against in the mean time, but they are adding single player in a free update soon.

 • Super Mega Baseball 2, $30. Not a lot of great sports games I'd recommend, but this one has online, an incredible gameplay balance appeal to anyone. The customization tools for logos/players/teams have kept me busy for 100s of hours alone.

 • Rocket League, $20. We all know this game by now, but one of the most addicting and appealing esports games of the decade. Incredibly active user base with 100,000+ users online all the time.

 • Trials Rising, $20ish. The newest Trials game which had a formula that makes you want to constantly beat your high score, and has online. While the gameplay is flawed on the switch unless you have a GameCube controller with Analog controls, it can easily be a big time eater. Also has incredible customization tools. This is not for everyone, but it could easily fit a niche that will make your week fly by.

 • Monopoly, $10. Yes, it's Monopoly. A good enough recreation of the game. Has online you can play with your quarantined family.

 • Fortnite, Warframe, Paladins, Smite, Warface. FREE. Hard to beat free, and these all have appeal for various reasons that can keep you busy for a long, long time.


Obviously we all have different tastes, but what are some of your suggestions?",244,1584989841,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnpml4/given_were_all_stuck_inside_for_awhile_what_are/,NintendoSwitch,1

fno7r9,lizard_e_,In your opinion why do you think Nintendo isn't using the switch lite for limited editions and would you buy one?,"Nintendo loves their limited edition handhelds, and given where they are priced it's not too hard to convince fans to buy another console just because it has their favorite character. 

So why isn't Nintendo using the switch lite for the limited editions as opposed to the full switch. If they were using the lite, would you be more likely to buy a limited edition?",9,1584985380,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fno7r9/in_your_opinion_why_do_you_think_nintendo_isnt/,NintendoSwitch,1
fno6bp,cole8055,Solid release date for Cooking Mama: Cookstar?,"I’ve seen a few different dates, but can’t seem to find anything concrete really. Is it March 24th? March 31st? April 28th?

fno3r8,DevChatt,ANCH needs to address their Player 2 limitations...but they won't,"Ok, guys, I've been playing this game for a bit and learned of how great the experience is...for player 1. Player 1 is legit seen as the main character in this game (the resident representative) and envisions the entire island (creates the museum, creates building houses for any new residents that want to move in, etc.). Player 2 is primarily a sidekick throughout where they can pretty much just decorate and build up their house.  They cannot start any of the actual ""quests"" in this game other than pay off their debts to Tom Nook.  Player 2  gets gipped of the fun of actually building anything as of right now and watching the town grow and succeed (unless they play as player 1 ofcourse). Player 2 can't even contribute to the town projects and must drop and pass to player 1.   This is quite similar to the mayor feature it seems in the older games.

The only way for multi user households to get the full experience is to have a second switch where one of the profiles gets transferred there where they can have a second island and have the player 1 experience. 

To be honest, this is quite frustrating. I actually really enjoyed the idea of sharing an island with my SO and watching it grow together, but since only one of us is the RR the game is catered around them building up everything at the moment, the person who plays that player 1 profile really has full control of the island and decisions behind it (heck they can also just delete my character as well). 

My solution to this: implement a feature where the RR can switch between players as deemed fit, or make everyone a RR and allow collaborate contributions. I believe this is the way the game was meant to be made to have everyone play.  If they couldn't do this, allow multiple islands per switch (which i'm sure fans have cried about now and they aren't gonna do this either).

Will Nintendo do this? probably not...why not? because the game is currently a top seller and everyone is playing it and enjoying it. Why would Nintendo want to not cash in on a way to sell more switches. Also very few reviews are mentioning this and/or mentioning it solemnly. 

It's such a dang letdown as  I was looking forward to this release but it honestly feels like a one and a half player game maybe meant for an adult and a kid, not for a collaborate team building game. 

i'd like someone to possibly prove me wrong and see if i'm stating something inaccurately or has better experience in the game (i'm speaking from what i've read and what i've played into) because this is ridiculously frustrating.

fnnx7v,doubledub,Pretty disappointed by the lack of Local+Online Games.,"My wife and I like to play together, and since the quarantine started we have been logging some crazy hours into our switch. We tried for the first time to play together online with some friends since we can't play in person.

That's when we found out that there are barely any games that support online play with multiple players on the same switch. The only two we have found are Mario Kart and Smash. Our biggest disappointment was Mario Party.

Not only can you not even play a game of Mario party over online. (You're limited to about 8 minigames). You can't play with 2 players on one Switch, even though the game makes you play against 2 computers.

Monopoly was another one that made zero sense to not have the support. We can play 1v1 online and then add AI. How is that any different than adding 2v2 with AI.

Sorry for the rant but the original Switch commercials made it seem like the console where everyone can play together all at once. Turns out that is barely true.",10,1584984472,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnnx7v/pretty_disappointed_by_the_lack_of_localonline/,NintendoSwitch,1

fnn2f9,TaffoFox,Bad Switch Lite Repair Experience,"Hi. I bought a Switch Lite during black Friday last year and for the first few days, I loved it! I got the Lite over the regular version because I didn't have much spare time at home, so there was no point spending extra for TV capability. After spending a while on Mario Kart, the system got hot and decided to turn on the fan. The fan was loud, rattly and squeaky and I had to turn it off instantly. I soon got this replaced in store and continued playing Mario Kart.

After a while, I decided to get Rocket League! Each button on the Switch was bound to a specific control, rather than Mario Kart using 2 sets like triggers and shoulder buttons for same action. After using the triggers for the first time, I noticed that the right one was slightly wobbly and was ever so sensitive to pressure changes. If I loosened my grip the tiniest amount, the trigger would deregister and therefore my car would stop accelerating in-game.

Oh well, I decided I wanted to buy more games, such as Pokemon Sword and Shield. Before I bought them, I wanted to make sure my Switch was repaired just in case it could get any worse, instead of doing it later and having unused games lying around. I can't get it replaced in the shop as they have a 1-month in-store warranty and the Switch comes with 1 year of Nintendo warranty.

After sending it in, it was about a month before I got a response of ""No fault found"". I thought they just didn't see my problem and I explained it to customer support, providing videos of the issue. They acknowledged this was an issue and asked me to send it in again. 

After a week of being in ""priority"" repair, I got the repair status of ""button replaced"". I was very delighted that they had finally found the problem and couldn't wait to play more games! However, when it finally arrived, I noticed that the button was much much worse. It would hardly register clicks without excessive force, kept registering many times in a second on one press and was a game-breaker. 

I emailed Nintendo again and asked if they could do anything about it. I asked if they had a replacement, but they insisted that they could fix the issue by just replacing the button. Again, they told me to send it to the repair centre after acknowledging there was a problem. After many weeks, I got the repair status of ""operating system problem"" and after it arrived, there was no noticeable changes at all.

After all this, I can't even play games properly and can't get it replaced despite having a year of warranty left. I sent yet another email, but now I'm not getting any responses at all. Could they have blocked me? They know it's an issue because they wouldn't have kept on asking me to send it in.  


Is there anything I can do at this point? Did anyone",7,1584981659,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnn2f9/bad_switch_lite_repair_experience/,NintendoSwitch,1

fnn0lx,bakerboy0017,Luigi's Mansion 3 DLC Floor Types Spawn? Plus Other Questions,"In Luigi's Mansion 3's ScareScraper DLC, there are three new floor types. However, I've never ONCE gotten any of these floor types without using the costumes. It says that the costumes ""guarantee"" the floor types showing up, but... doesn't that imply that they are otherwise totally random? So far, I literally don't get anything but the standard floor type when playing as ordinary Luigi, and the only alternate floor types I get are for the specific costumes I choose. I.e. I ONLY get the Egyptian floor style when I am Mummy Luigi, and no one else.

Has anyone else been able to get the alternate floor types without them (or anyone else in the team) using a costume? While I really like Luigi's Mansion 3 for its single player, I'm finding the multiplayer to be more and more lacking between glitches and what appears to be outright oversights. Am I just super unlucky? Or is everyone else that is using the DLC experiencing this as well?

Also, how often do you find glitches in your games? I think EVERY run with other people has so far included at least one glitch (the plunger not sticking). 

Finally, has anyone else experienced the glitch during the last boss of single player, where - after making two extra copies of himself - the boss won't proceed after two of the copies get stuck on top of each other? Happens during the fireball attack. Only way I was able to beat this was using the Golden Bone the game gave me at the beginning - I literally had to let the timer run out, die, use the golden bone, then finish the boss off before the glitch could happen again.

1) I have a lot of friends on my NS and a lot them are playing AC and yet when I go into my friend list in the game it says I have no friends.

2) Do I have to open the gates at the airport to get friends to come to my island? And vice versa? But how am I supposed to communicate that to my Nintendo Switch friends? There is no way to send a request or talk to them.

3) Is there a way to visit random people's islands? Seems like an obvious feature that would be pretty cool to check out people's designs and stuff.

fnmewa,luucif3r,Best Alternative Joy-Cons without drift (from a third-party company)?,"Hello everyone,

I got my Switch in the summer of 2017. About an year later, after hundreds of hours of Splatoon 2 and Breath of the Wild, my Joy-Cons started drifting. This issue is far from unheard of, as millions of people have been reporting the same problem since more than a year ago. Yet, Nintendo is still oblivious to this, refusing to offer a permanent solution to an issue that increasingly seems to be an inevitability.

Most ""solutions"" found online are, unfortunately, not very effective (at least for me) and/or mere band-aid solutions. I'm looking for a **PERMANENT** way to solve this issue for myself and, in the process of doing so, I hope I can help more people with the same wish with this thread.  
 

This way, I firstly want to clarify what I'm **NOT** looking for:

\- **Joy-Cons' joy-sticks cleansing**: Yes, I've already cleaned the joy-sticks of my Joy-Cons multiple times with the right product and technique, according to dozens of articles and Youtube videos. This barely worked for me, as the effect only lasted a few hours.

\- **Joy-Con replacement**: No, I don't live in the US, so replacing my current Joy-Cons for free isn't an option for me. Plus, that really wouldn't be a satisfactory solution either way, as the replacement Joy-Cons would probably get the same issue eventually.

\- **Performing ""Joy-Con Surgery""**: What I mean by this is replacing solely the Joy-Cons' joy-sticks by opening them and carefully replacing the parts in question. I refuse to do this or any other ""surgery"" solutions, as they are way too risky.

\- **Buying another pair of Joy-Cons**: Spending 80€ in new Joy-Cons that will almost certainly have the same issue? No thanks.

\- **Buying other Nintendo Switch controllers and products**: For those who don't know, there have also been thousands of reported drifting issues with the Switch Pro Controller and other Nintendo Switch compatible products, as well as with the Nintendo Switch Lite. Furthermore, no, the new Nintendo Switch version did **NOT** fix the Joy-Con drift.

\- **Buying an 8Bitdo and playing with a controller from another console**: I already plan on doing this. However, this solution only makes it practical to play in tabletop mode, as there isn't another controller in the market like the Joy-Con. Plus, I much more frequently play in handheld mode.

\- **'Just be more careful with your Joy-Cons! I've had my Joy-Cons for 8 years and they've never drifted!'**: Good for you honey, but guess what? No one cares!; I've always been really careful with my Switch and kept it safe in a clean and comfortable console case. Dust **WILL** eventually find a way in. Besides, paranoidly trying to keep it safe from dust **SHOULDN'T** be a condition to being able to play normally.

   
 

Finally getting to the point, **what I'm really looking for is an alternative for the official Nintendo Switch Joy-Con that DOESN'T drift (from a third-party company).** I'm looking for a product from a third-party company with the best quality possible that resolves this issue. Preferably, it should be structurally similar to the original Joy-Cons, being attachable to the console and working both in tabletop and handheld mode (like the Kinvoca Joy Con Controller, for example). However, since I'm more keen on playing in handheld mode, working in that mode should be the priority. Preferably, it should also be sold in [Amazon.co.uk](https://amazon.co.uk/), but even if it's not, still feel free to write in down.

Yes, I have already searched this for myself, but I couldn't find much information regarding the drift with most products.

He’s my favorite villager, so I think it would be so cute to start this island adventure with him. He was the first villager friend I made back in AC for the GameCube. So this is pretty sentimental. I’ve probably reset 50 or 60 times (lmao). I can create my character in under 10 seconds now Lolol.

It’s so frustrating because I’ve gotten other villagers (like Genji) multiple times. Genji’s cute, but he’s not Bill 😭.

So have any of you actually started out with him? I  just want to make sure that it’s actually possible to start with Bill. I think if I don’t get him by tonight, I’ll just give up and take whomever the game gives me—(Probably Genji) 😂

We share the same island. I remembered hearing about this, but it's no big deal. She actually likes idea of being my neighbour in the game. However now we've run into an inexplicable decision by Nintendo: her progress is gated until I play further. Not only that, but she can't make placement decisions. Or unlock things the same way I did. What gives Nintendo?

Our city is basically on lockdown because of COVID-19, however my job allows me to work from home so I'm still working 8+ hours per day. She's off work until things return to normal. She has time to play; I don't. The shared island isn't a problem, but Nintendo needs to fix this bullshit decision that the second profile can't progress until I do, or at least give the option to start a new island so they can play at leisure.

fnkbg3,rossmark,Will Nintendo make a big eShop sale sometime during this outbreak?,"Outbreak in almost all the world. Restrictions on leaving home during the pandemic. For those who play video games, it is a great pastime.

And during all this, one or the other game on Steam has great promotions, some even for free. I can see it happening on the PS Store or Xbox Live

Can you imagine Nintendo doing the same with its main games on the eShop?

And I am not talking about 33% as in some of Mario during Mar10. I'm talking about 50% or more for the main games, like Mario Kart, BotW or Odyssey.

The crisis is tightening, especially where I live (Brazil has screwed up economically, the dollar is more expensive than ever) and without a promotion, it would be difficult in the next few days or weeks.

Link's Awakening for $ 60 is a lot. Metro games are newly launched, but not necessarily new.

I don't see any promotion for Animal Crossing anytime soon, so I'll never get it, but bigger cuts for Mario Maker, old Skyrin, Capcom games... Why not?

Do you think that if this outbreak lasts a long time, we will see promotions above 75%, even for big hits, at the eShop?

fnie0t,SarcasticBarbie96,Does anyone have advice for trying to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch?,"Hello everyone!

I hope this isn't against the rules but I (like a lot of other people, I'm sure), am super keen to get my hands on the Animal Crossing Limited Edition of the Switch.

But literally all the scalpers in my area have just en masse bought the console. On Ebay the prices are all over £450 and Amazon second hand sellers has the prices around £600.

I was wondering if anyone knew of any websites or shops in Europe that I could potentially check? I just saved up enough money and with not being able to do anything for my birthday in a couple of weeks this was my first option. There is a shop near me that says that they should be getting stock on the 30th but with everything that's going on they'll be unsure about the shipment until the 28th.

Am I overreacting here? It's been a few days of self isolation (I live alone) so it's entirely possible I'm just stir crazy and overreacting. Any and all advice is welcome – I most definitely do ***not*** want to buy from scalpers.

fni4f7,Veyrah,"External ""Motion Smoothing""/Frame Interpolation device?","Hello guys,

After searching the internet for a solution that fits my needs I have come here to see if anyone here knows of something that could help.

The subject of motion smoothing is mostly controversial when speaking of films, but for many games (in my case Animal Crossing), where there is not a lot of abrupt movement and mostly a lot of camera panning, the added smoothness feels really good. It actually feels like 60 fps when the game is rendered at 30.

My problem is that I have tried this on a shared TV that incorporates this technique. My usual screen for switch gaming is a PC monitor that does not have this function. Does any of you know of some kind of external device I could put between my switch and the monitor to generate these frames?",10,1584961345,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fni4f7/external_motion_smoothingframe_interpolation/,NintendoSwitch,1

Do I simply set up his switch as secondary? Will his child account be automatically added once I sign in?

I went to the airport on my Animal Crossing island and asked Orville to open the gate for visitors, thinking maybe I could receive visitors without having a Nintendo Switch Online membership. I dunno, I wasn't really thinking. I previously had a 3-month membership through a Twitch Prime promotion, but I had deactivated automatic renewal. Nonetheless, I already had my PayPal payment information hooked up to Nintendo Online.

Anyway, the moment the Dodo opens the gate, my phone vibrates with a push message from PayPal, informing me that I have just paid 19,99€ to Nintendo. What?!

I was about to purchase a Switch Online membership anyway, so I didn't really mind. But am I crazy, or did I just unwittingly purchase a year-long membership simply by talking to a flightless bird in my game?!

I've been looking intensively for games to play together with my wife, but I struggle a lot.

And I believe you can help me more than Google.

We have been playing :

* Super Mario Odyssey
* Heave Ho
* Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
* Overcooked 1 / 2
* Tower of Babel No Mercy
* Unravel Two

I've been considering Animal Crossing, but I'm not sure it's a really cool coach game (with 1 switch only). Or Divinity Original Sin 2, but I think it isn't splitscreen.

1. Folders for the games. Please.
2. Background/ themes
3. Streetpass-like integration.
4. Trophy/Achievement system (I come from platinum hunting on PS)
5. Miiverse? (Not highly important, but I do kind of miss this... communities for each game was kind of cool) 
6. Actvity Log
7. Custom folders in the Album section. 
8. Messaging system for one to one messaging or a group text chat with up to 10ppl. 
9. Bring back Nintendo Land. 
10. Make profiles a bit more elegant or exciting. It's so plain. Make the system pop! There's no standing out, everyone's switches are basically all the same.

This is all just a wish list, I don't expect any of this to happen but it would be nice.

about the games, the used one doesnt come with any. i only plan to buy animal crossing and ring fit for now. would the internal sd card will be enough for it?

I got the new Animal Crossing Switch, and was attempting to transfer everything from my old Switch onto the new one. I went through the whole process of transferring user data, but as soon as I downloaded and opened up AC on the new console, it sent me back to the starting cut scene (at this point, I probably had put two days into the game on the old Switch).

I looked back on the old console and it showed that my game data appeared to have been saved directly to the SD card. I figured I could just move the SD card to the new console and that would restore save data. However, when I popped in the SD card, I got a message saying that the SD card was  linked to another Switch, and all data would have to be deleted off the SD card before I could use it. I tried moving the save data to my PC and wiping the SD card, then popping it in the new Switch to let it connect. As soon as I put the save data (from the PC) on the SD card again, I got the message saying it needed to be wiped.

So now I'm completely stuck on what to do next. It appears the only thing that transferred was my user profile,  which is basically just logging into my Nintendo account on the new Switch. I still open up all my games on the old console and they have all the save data.

Is there any realistic chance that they would update the game to either remove the ""Resident Representative"" tag completely, or at least allow multiple users to hold the title?",21,1584940109,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fneeod/what_are_the_chances_nintendo_actually_updates/,NintendoSwitch,1

First off I'm sorry for asking as I'm sure you get this type of question all the time, but I couldn't find an answer that really fit my wishes.

So I'm looking for an RPG that is pretty long as I've got quite some time currently like most of you I imagine. I would also prefer a turn based battle system. 
The thing I enjoy the most in RPGs is usually the upgrading aspect. (Character or Weapon upgrades and stuff like that)

Games in that direction I have played already are DQ XI, Ni No Kuni and Digimon Cyber Sleuth. I've enjoyed all of them a lot eventhough Dragon Quest was my clear favorite.

fndsjy,TheMcGUnit,My wife hates video games ... with one exception now. She just put in 5 hours to Animal Crossing: New Horizons.,"I picked up one of the ACNH special edition switches last week, even though my OG launch day Switch is still going strong.  It just looked so unique  and when I saw it on the shelf (AAFES) I couldn't pass it up.  Wasn't sure what to do with it until my wife saw me play the game and wanted to know if she could make her own island ... seeing as how I had a second Switch now I thought, sure why not.  So we booted up the game and she got immediately sucked right into the world.  

Seriously, video games are not her thing.  The only thing I've ever been able to get her to consistently play with me is Dr. Mario.  She struggles with finding the buttons and doesn't have the fine motor control on the thumbstick that most gamers take for granted.  But an hour later, there she was figuring out how to catch fish, craft items, and strategizing how to pay back her debt to Tom Nook.  She even caught a wasp!

This was also my first AC game after over 30 years gaming.  I just wasn't sure what it was all about, but the Switch has made me jump into a lot of franchises I never otherwise would have.  Add AC to that list ... its unique delivery is really something different and special.  The way it slowly but steadily drips new content and features is genius in preventing new players from feeling overwhelmed.  It gives you just enough to do keep you engaged but not so much that you feel like you don't know where to begin.  You get involved in one task but then this shiny thing over here pulls you in a different direction.  In a way, it reminded me of my first play-through of BOTW in that regard ... ""Hey lemme go harvest some wood, but wait there's a fish!  Hey is that a new kind of butterfly?  Wait come back!""  I loved it immediately and am shocked (and delighted) that my wife did too.  Can't wait until her airport opens tomorrow so we can visit each other's islands.

Anyways, loving the game and ACNH made me an instant fan of this franchise.  If it can get my wife interested it's definitely doing something right!",195,1584937119,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fndsjy/my_wife_hates_video_games_with_one_exception_now/,NintendoSwitch,1

It’s one of the most popular games on Twitch, but all that will change quickly with the current limitations to the online modes. Surprise! Nintendo made the online painful in one of their biggest games! As a streamer it takes minutes for each player to load into your town. This is because the island is hosted locally and everything is peer to peer. They need a persistent mode where you can have and always online island where you and your friends can come and go as you please. This would require dedicated servers and probably and an additional cost to Nintendo and the players but it really needs to happen for this game to reach its full potential. A Minecraft Realm costs me like $25 every six months.

So our family got bit by the AC bug, very quickly figured out the limitations with only 1st player getting a real game.

Likely adding a switch lite and just want to make sure I have the process right.

* Add same Nintendo account to new switch
* Use save game transfer to copy saves (you can pick just the one profile to copy yeah? )
* We have some digital purchase, afaik you can also download to new switch just can't play both at once (that's fine, not worries about janky workarounds)
* Both playing AC on both consoles but both with game cartridge - it's not still gonna force us to the same island yeah? Will not copy data for AC as we need to reset anyway.

* Take out loans for a house to get to the next level to take out another loan
* Travel to random islands and pillage them before leaving forever
* Collect items to amass a mess of useless items you drop on the ground
* The entire miles system of doing normal things to be rewarded to gain abstract currency that gives you even more currency when spending it

The progression is bloated yet incredibly simple at the same time. It's wrapped in weak psychological tricks and the explanations of why you're doing what you're doing in game are the equivalent of selfishness.

fnbv3h,3lucina,Would Love Some Help Fixing My Switch's Internet Connection,"Not exactly sure where to post this, but the rules don't say it's not allowed.

Recently I have been getting a lot of lag to the point where Smash is unplayable. I'll do an Internet speed test, and I'll get about 3 mbps down/up. This is way lower than the plan we're paying for (300mbps). I use a powerline adapter as well because my setup is not near my modem/router. I've been using it for a couple of months and it's worked great! Usually getting speeds of 30 mbps up/down. I used to get no lag at all, but this past week it's been getting slower and slower. So let me describe the problem.

It's best if I put all the information I have in a list:

* My WiFi speed on my laptop is 100+ mbps down, 30+ up and 12ms ping
* Using the same ethernet cord of my Switch (also through the powerline adapter), tested on my laptop, I get 50+ down, 20+ up, basically no ping (.1 ms)
* When I test my wired connection on my Switch, it's below 6 mbps up/down
   * Apparently you only need about 3mbps up/down to play and less than 150ms ping, but I fit that criteria
* When I test my wireless connection on my Switch, it's around 10 up/down, still much lower than my laptop
* My LAN adapter is third party (Plugable USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter) but has been working for a couple of months, but I know the Switch only has USB 2.0
* I've tried changing the recommended Internet settings on the Switch:
   * MTU 1500
   * Primary DNS [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8), Secondary DNS [8.8.4.4](https://8.8.4.4) (Google's public DNS)
* It's not a community problem because the rest of the devices in my house have good speeds
* I've done a fair amount of research and it seems nobody else has this problem, Discord hasn't helped either

I would love some help on this, no idea what the problem is but I'm pretty sure it's the Switch itself. I don't know where else to ask for help as well. Thank you!",3,1584928640,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnbv3h/would_love_some_help_fixing_my_switchs_internet/,NintendoSwitch,1

fnbude,madirayn,Game Recs?,"I got a Switch for Christmas, but have only recently been interested in getting some games.

Obviously, I'm interested in the new animal crossing because I enjoyed Animal Crossing: New Leaf, (however, I feel I might grow bored of the game; I don't go on New Leaf much anymore because there would never be much to do when I did log on) but I'm also thinking of getting Breath of the Wild (though, my friends also say I wouldn't be too fond of that game either).

I've loved story-driven games with pretty/cute visuals, but I'm not the best at fighting games bc I get too flustered during fights. I've enjoyed Pokemon Moon, New Leaf, Ocarina of Time, DDLC, Mystic Messenger, among other similar games (I haven't 'completed' any of them as I'm a lil prone to slacking off with my gameplay).

I've also heard good things about Skyrim and I've always been interested in RP games.

I guess, what I'm looking for is smth story-driven, with lovely visuals, and that can be for casual gameplay.

But I want to know, what games do you recommend? Should I get one of the mentioned games?",10,1584928567,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/fnbude/game_recs/,NintendoSwitch,1
fnbsp9,TokenPls,Animal Crossing AC Secondary Profile Restrictions,"My boyfriend and I are playing ACNH on my switch and we’re sharing a town. He’s playing on a secondary profile and it looks like he can’t learn many of the essential DIY recipes. 

For example, we are are up to the part in the game where we plot put new houses for potential villagers and we need to build some furniture for each house. Tom gave me, player 1, the necessary DIY recipes for those projects. We got really excited and my boyfriend, player 2, said he wanted to build all the furniture needed for one of the houses. We came to realize that he cant learn any of those DIYs. 

There are other recipes that he seems locked out of like the important Log Stakes needed to make a bridge are not available to him. He really just wanted to make those fences not necessarily for a bridge but just for himself. The other required furniture for those three houses are also things he wanted to make for his house. 

Does anyone know if he can buy the DIY recipes for those items? I know we struggled at first with the whole situation where I have to give him an axe recipe in the very beginning but we were wondering if there was a similar solution to the situation. We tried looking at the nook store and talking to Tom to find out where to buy the recipes with no luck. 

This is all very frustrating for us and especially him. He wants to take part of making the island as much as me and this just seems like a cheap excuse to buy another switch. I just am very upset for him and it’s just plain awful for the both of us. I’ve seen some people talking about problems like these already but just wanted a bit more info. 

TLDR; Can secondary profile accounts eventually learn essential DIY recipes such as Log Stakes and Natural Garden Table like how axes were locked out for secondary profiles? What are the exact restrictions for secondary profiles?

PS; Can secondary profiles move buildings, make bridges and use the late game terraforming tool?

I'm trying to figure out a workaround for the 1 island per system limit, and I was wondering if I were to get another MicroSD card and swap it each time one of us logs in if that would allow us to have 2 islands?

Basically, MicroSD #1 would have our original download of ACNH. Then, I'd put in MicroSD #2 and buy the game again. Once installed, we would switch MicroSDs each time one of us wanted to play on their own island.

So I have been playing Animal Crossing on my ACNH Switch (this is not my primary switch, as I carry a Switch Lite as my Primary). I have found an issue regarding Physical games, DLC, and the Check if this game can be played. it looks like even if you have a Physical copy of a game (most of my games are physical) if you have any kind of DLC for that game it will require you have a internet connection. so this does not apply to games that have updates, just ones you have DLC for. I have tested this with a couple of my games as I have DLC for BOTW and I have DLC in ACNH (free item you can get on the eshop) along with other games I have DLC for (all physical copies of games), and all of these games if not played on my Primary do the check if can be played. this means that if I Travel and want to take Animal Crossing I have to have to be able to connect to the internet, which my not always be possible or I have to change my primary console, which doesn't help as I am only playing ACNH on the Switch and everything else I am playing on my Switch Lite. is anyone else having this kind of issue. I understand checking if game can be played for Digital games for anti-piracy, but to do this to physical games just because of DLC is ridiculous.
