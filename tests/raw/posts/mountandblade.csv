fsofxm,SwsCheese,Republics?,So after playing Bannerlord a bit yesterday and today I had an idea of what could be done with some the mechanics present. If the merchants of a city or kingdom get too unhappy with their lords and such it would be cool if they could offer various lords and the player the opportunity to lead troops in revolt and create a merchant republic with the most influential merchant of a city becoming its new lord and votes on what the republic does by the major merchants of the realm. I don't know how feasible it would be to implement this but it could be a cool third option to how the player interacts with the world other than independent lord and feudal vassal.,0,1585699129,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsofxm/republics/,mountandblade,3

fsodce,drdirkleton,"The Khuzait, Shieldwalls, and the State of Balance in Bannerlord","Hello, r/mountandblade! I hope you've all been enjoying Bannerlord; I've been playing the Khuzait, and, well, I would like to discuss a simple fact: the Khuzait are absolutely overpowered. I haven't played the Sturgians, the Vlandians, the Battanians, or the Aserai, so I would appreciate your input, but...

Horse archers are insanely powerful. This is historically accurate for the time period, to be sure, but at the same time, the game lacks any of the counters to horse archers that were employed historically. Indeed there is no way to circle the wagons to produce a temporary fortification of desperation, there is no way to construct a war camp in the field, and there is no means in the game to deploy stakes or other cavalry traps. In a game with such amazing sieges and a dedicated engineering skill, this seems like an oversight--but the reality is that it has tremendous effects on game balance when  the AI for horse archers employs historically accurate tactics to circle an enemy and pepper them with arrows before mopping them up.

Further enforcing the strength of the Khuzait Khanate is the weakness of shieldwalls. I'm not sure if this is due to the directional blocking mechanic, but unfortunately the method by which infantry is supposed to be able to defend against archers is absolutely futile. And honestly, that's disappointing: the shield wall of the Nord Huscarl in Mount and Blade was exactly where it needed to be, with regards to game balance. I would even say that for the purposes of gameplay, I would like to see a return to the arrow-magnet shields of yesteryear.

I understand that Bannerlord is Early Access and thus it is obviously not balanced yet, but that is exactly why I think it's important to discuss the state of game balance--especially when things seem as broken as they do right now. Thank you for reading, and if you have any input with regards to balance or tactics, I would love to hear it!",8,1585698870,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsodce/the_khuzait_shieldwalls_and_the_state_of_balance/,mountandblade,5

fsod8a,nerodmc_2001,Balancing issues that I notice after about 20 hours in," I'm about 20 hours, 200 in-game days in playing as a tier 3 (600+ renowns) Khuzait vassal clan with an army of roughly 40/60 lancers/horse archers, with 2 towns (6 fiefs), 6 companions (3 clan parties), a wife and a kid (wifey just got pregnant again). Absolutely enjoy the gameplay and the various, dynamic systems so far. There are 2 balance issues that I think should be addressed asap:

* Economy: By midgame, no matter what you do you'll literally never run out of money: every time u beat a lord, u get around 5-7k from ransoms, post-battle spoils and selling loots(That's how much I get even though I keep 100% of the horses I got from battle). It's great that the game gives more money compared to Warband since more money means more money to spend, more decision-making = more fun. However, a lot of the in-game price level stays at the same level compared to Warband. Tier-5 units costing 250 to upgrade is ridiculously low and wages are neglible when you factor in taxes. The best solution here is to add more things for the player to spend money on (settlement customization, perhaps.) However, I still think that balancing the current price level is a must (\*cough\* \*cough\* 20k crossbow \*cough\* \*cough\*). The current patch just hotfixed a cap for workshops. Imo, even if you do balance the workshop income later, that only fixes the infinite money ""exploit"" (not really an exploit just horribly broken mechanic lol.) What you really need to do is create an engaging, challenging economy which the game itself already has every potential to become.
* Garrison: This is something that I'm really concerned about. There's no option to auto recruit/train units in your settlements which means that you have to do it yourself and the AI seldom does this. By midgame, if you look at some of the settlements that have changed hands between factions they will literally have 0 garrisons, just pure militia creating a gigantic snowball effect with factions getting steamrolled at lightning speed. This, coupled with the fact that governors are mostly useless, damages siege gameplay enormously and makes mid-to-late game seem boring (Also, a lot of the midgame features are still in planning stage.)

Aside from those, there are only minor issues that can be fixed gradually along the course of EA. In term of bugs, I'm honestly surprised that I haven't gotten any, my friend has gotten about 3.

The game is goddamn amazing. I'm so impressed by the level of ambition shown by the devs. The game, itself, is around as big as Warband and twice as deep. Yet, you can find the frameworks for all kind of future features everywhere in the game. All of the existing systems are very well-designed as well. On a technical level, the game is really well optimized for EA, as long as you run on your compatiable graphic level, you will have some of the smoothest gameplay ever (expect small freezes in combat every now and then.)

If anyone needs early game tips, feel free to ask.

Some other minor issues that stick out to me: polearms dealing 250+ dmg to heavily armored enemies while a headshot with bow deals 80-100 (don't even kill tier-2+ units :/); Looters are literally free food compared to bandits or raiders or even villagers...; Hideout battles (fuck those).",13,1585698859,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsod8a/balancing_issues_that_i_notice_after_about_20/,mountandblade,3

fsocbn,CaesarJulius91,Tip for making good money early game/whenever,"Hi all, early game tip for you is to get yourself some mules or Sumpter horses for extra carry weight, load up to capacity on the cheapest grain you can find and go find a town that is being besieged, wait for the poor souls inside to be starved half to death and slaughtered by the opposing force, or maybe even be victorious but regardless they will be starving with negative reserves, that's when you, the almighty hero, enter the town before any caravans and price gouge the fuck out of them at like 26 gold per unit of grain.

The cheapest you can get grain is 5 per unit so you will make a lot of money.

Loving the game so far even though I'm getting absolutely wrecked. Just wondering if you anyone knows if there will be additional features added during early access or will the game stay mostly the same until full release?

So I have played the game 25 hours already and I have experience all the good and bad things in this early acess so this are the problems that need to be fixed in following updates.

\-The fucking trial by jury just continiusly gives you bad influence all the time.

\-The AI in sieges give me cancer both defenders and atackers.

\-The AI some times makes war against eavry fucking Kingdom and just dies in the firs hours (Especially the South Empire in my case)

\-Heroes prisioners desapiering from the party.

\-Archers doing nothing when they could killing the enemy un least you tell them to charche

\-The game crashes if you play long enough.

\-Wedings are just click and there is no cinematic or evento to do.

\-Gifts dont make lords friendly to you more.

\-The tutorial doesnt explain the game well to new players (I have played warband since 2012 and I was a little lose at the begining)

\-There is a limit of bussines that you can buy so that make you difficult to have a bigger army if you dont have any land.

\-Some caracters just tell you that you cant help them because your faction is at war even if you are IN THE SAME FACTION.

\-Inlfuence is a whore and renown doesnt helps on the pobability on getting land. 

\-Kings dont actually have the autority that you imagine of a king beacause eavry lord votes to give you land, it will be nice if the king would have the hability to tell them to go and fuck in other and give you the land to you if they are friends. (Vlandia Kingdom)

\-Donating noble prisioners doesnt help the Kingdom in war I have donated the fucking leader of the Khuzaits and they just put them to be rotten in a cell and keep in war whit the Khuzaits. They could end the war an get lands by diplomacy

\-The civil war in the empire is just too peacefull the Bizantines civil wars use to be savage ones. 

\-There is no way you can be a gang lord in the game. 

\-Some Kingdoms keep declaring war on eavryone even if they are been raped by evry flank. And some Kingdoms despite they are savage barbarians are just peacefully chilling all the time. 

\-Helping in battles  together whit the others lords doesnt increase they good opinion.

I am sure they are more but I dont now them, if you now more please write them down.",10,1585696817,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsnsj1/things_that_need_to_be_fixed_on_bannerdlord/,mountandblade,0

After downloading todays patch, I got the 'module' warning in-game yet proceeded to load anyways after seeing several other players managing to continue their games with no issue. However, this visual bug has appeared and persists in both my original save and a backup I made roughly 20-30 mins before. I then started a new game and it's occuring there as well.

Note, this only affects the Battanian potraits (to my knowledge).",0,1585695300,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsncwt/visual_bug_after_update/,mountandblade,1

fsmmtj,DeathDiamond119,My thoughts on the Workshop/Enterprise system,"So I finally saved up a enough denars to invest in my own workshop, I bought the brewery at Pravend and expected to manage the enterprise by stocking it with grain and then collecting the beer and selling it. The same way it used to be in Warband.

Unfortunately this was not the case. It turns out you can't do anything at your workshop except for changing the type of goods it manufactures and sells. The business literally runs itself, it feels very empty and disappointing. After a week in-game I got around 60 denars a day after investing 14k into the workshop. So I tried switching it up and I turned it into a smithy and ended up getting around 400-800 denars a day which is much better. I currently own 3 Smiths in different cities and it brings in a nice, steady income.

Taleworlds released a new patch and capped the daily income of workshops to 200 denars a day, which doesn't really do it, it takes away the whole point of having a business as you can only have 3 active businesses at a time and that equals to a max of 600 denars income daily. I mean 400-600 denars a day is still reasonable, but paying 14k denars to get 200 denars a day just doesn't cut it. How am I going to feed and pay the wages of my army of 100+ while being out in the field?

I am extremely positive that they are still going to spend time on the Workshop system and make it similar to how it was in Warband at least, you can tell by the way they describe some things referring to Workshops. Take note, this isn't a complaint, I'm just sharing my thoughts. I think this game is amazing so far and I really can't wait to see what else Taleworlds has in store for us regarding this game.

fslxej,ItsWackMan,Update on my small review yesterday,"So I wrote a small review yesterday, after playing 8h, today after a total of 18h I have a bit different opinions:

1) There seem to be several SUPER annoying xp bugs, like autoselling all prisoners not giving xp on rouge and trader, tournaments, practices not giving weapon xp etc. How are these things unnoticed?

2) Weapon balancing: I have 1h on 100 (after 18h) and bow something of + 80, riding +80, trading 30 and surgery 25. I figured out some profitable trade routes and made money to build smithery/woodwork and got huge amount of money. BUT: char level 12 with full tier 6 armor and weapons gets 2-3hitted from a looter with a basic axe. Another thing I'm surprised was not found at testing. So: weapons are all super strong, armor does not give much only decreases speed by alot.

3) I'm on Vlandias side and the ai characters are flunky, I took 2 castles, spent influence to gather armies and even cant nominate myself. But that is to be expected from EA!

4) The loading screens seem to get longer after gaming sessions. Optimization mistake or memoryleak - totally understandable.  P.S. I will gladly talk to people (atleast merchant questgivers) on world map, no need to see their face.

5) The bugs with chat template's do not bother me at all. What bothers me is that half the time archers are not shooting, how was this not noticed at testing. Speaking of archers, they are VERY accurate and deadly! (Bcs armor sucks)

6) Item variety: This is something that I was not bothered by at first, but later oh boy. Nobody sells decent armor (except empire), the weapon/armor variety really is too small. Unexpected for me. 

7) Optimization: Some stuttering, not something too bad, will get better over time, I'm sure! About 3-4 crashes.

8) Some balancing tips: when we look at volunteers having 120 one handed and me after 18h 100, I feel like it is too hard, leveling things later really becomes too big of a chore. Even worse thanks to xp bugs. I hope it's easily fixable

9) Some grear things: Trading, skill trees

Final thoughts: This is not a rant, my first post was a big praise, BUT after not playing warband for years (waiting for Bannerlord) it was worth the wait until it was not. I love the atmosphere, music, traveling. I UNDERSTAND AND REPORT bugs, what I do not understand is the lack of content and very easy to spot bugs that are gamebraking. I wish these were done before release, because atm I feel like I don't want to play anymore and it sucks, because I really want to love the game.

fslms5,awardedindirector,A review of Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord from an average gamer,"Hello everyone. This is going to be very long. I apologize but I believe I must tell you some stuff up front. Also English is not my main language.

**SHOULD YOU BUY IT: Only on one condition.**

**1- You loved Warband as it was. With its almost\* every detail.**

Long time ago, a small game studio from Turkey developed Mount and Blade. This small team was called TaleWorlds and they did not only have creativity but they also had ambition to make one of the greatest games in the history of video games. I, as an average Turkish gamer loved it and embraced it as my own. We, as Turkish people do have the tendency to praise anything up to the skies if that thing is made by us. I believe this is called nationalism, but I will refrain from doing the same during this review-ish.

After Warband came out, I loved every second of it. I played in native mod for hundreds of hours, then I installed mods and hundreds evolved into thousands. I still play it from time to time. Like every other player on earth, I was waiting for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord after it was announced in 2012. Years passed with memes, delayed release dates and rumours. Hell, I even met one of the managers in a convention and got a t-shirt and a keychain which I still use. Waiting for Bannerlord became a reality in my life.

The idea of ""waiting"" it became more and more exciting. It became Adam's Apple. It seemed greener on the other side. Its sound was coming very delighftul when it was away. Do you want more metaphors or euphmisms?

**....----....**

But then it came out. It came out yesterday. Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord was released a day ago. This is unbelievable. And of course, I played it. Actually I have been playing it for 8 hours straight. And all I can say that...

**...it is ok.**

8 years of waiting has ended and the result is: OK. I know that the game is in early access and lots of things can change but I think I know how and to what extent the game can change. It is Mount &amp; Blade; I don't know what I was expecting. But it was not this. I am glad that it is not what I was expecting but I am also sad that it is **just** Mount and Blade. Let me tell you why.

**....----....**

Now the jibber-jabber is over. **The game is a polished Warband with lots of different features. It carries the same soul but sometimes it carries it too much.** I mean after 8 years of waiting, you don't know whether you should appreciate it for not leaving its roots or revile it for not being more ""different"".

&amp;#x200B;

**....----....**

**Combat System**

Combat system is more immersive and more difficult compared to Warband. Which is actually good because now you have that feeling of hitting a person instead of a rock. I know and remember that deligthful sense of killing soulles NPCs in Warband and that feeling is somewhat preserved in Bannerlord as well. You can still make your enemies pursue you while you snipe them with your bow on your horse. Yes, they are still that stupid.

**TL;DR: Nice enough to keep you occupied as Warband did. 8/10**

&amp;#x200B;

**Bugs and Glitches - EARLY ACCESS**

Unfortunately there are lots of bugs, glitches and lots of optimization problems but I managed to solve them from nVidia panel. Now it is smooth 60 FPS.

But it is quite possible to come across bugs and glitches during gameplay. But...early access.

&amp;#x200B;

**Trade System and Stuff**

The game design ideas you come across in the game make you say wow but they do not seem practical. For example, when you speak to an NPC in the tavern; you interrupt usually these words :

""Oh yes. I bought BLABLA from BLABLA. I am planning to sell it in BLABLA2 for BLABLA GOLD MORE haha...- Oops. Yes sir, what is it?""

This is actually cool. You can learn what to buy and where to sell from NPCs, but regardless of the people around them; they do this. When there are more than one NPCs it is okay. But let's say there is only one NPC and you go talk to him. Bum! You hear the same words. It loses its impact. This might sound trivial, but after seeing lots of devblogs of ""interactive taverns"", I am kind of disappointed.

But still, a lot of work went into the trading system. This game could be played with being completely a trader , I guess. You can even see the items bought by someone in the city. All of these give you the idea of buying and selling stuff. According to what you hear during you adventures, you see statements under trade items such as:

""You can buy this item here for 5 golds and sell it in BLABLA for 15 golds.""

Trading system is huge. In its is essence, it is a buy and sell of course; what else could it be? But it seems like they worked hard and added lots of stuff. Buying and selling is really an option now.

**TL;DR: Really good, immersive and a decent alternative for gameplay. 9/10**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Factions and Themes**

One of the best things in Bannerlord is the themes. The theme of every empire is immediately noticed the moment you enter their region. The music, the arena, the stuff you can buy and sell,  items and even the victory music change when you are in a different faction's region. It also seems like they managed to create a good interaction between factions as well.

As you would guess, all of the factions sort of resemble the real ones. Middle Asian warriors, Vikings, desert warriors, imperial knights and all the others...

And the process of being introduced into these factions was fun and it managed to attract my attention.

**TL;DR: Faction themes, items, arenas, music and all that other stuff seems well done. Calradia feels like...Calradia. 8/10**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Quest System**

They also said that the quest system will be much more immersive and it will also be expanded; I got my hopes up. But after 8 hours of playing, all I can do is to do four quests which can be taken from every city. Same quests over and over again. Yes, it was not a bummer in Warband; but unfortunately it is a bummer in Bannerlord. Becaus now the process is longer and it is more annoying. When I first took the quest, I got super excited. It was about taking some goods secretly from a merchant to sell it in another city; then you get interrupted by some other merchant and as a result the game gives you two chances: either leave the stuff and do the right thing OR sell it and earn your money. But after doing it 5 times and seeing all that same stuff from the NPCs, it became a bore.

&amp;#x200B;

**COMPANIONS**

Now instead of crying all the time, you can send your companions to these boring quests. You can also assign them to your group's positions. Healer, engineer, attacker etc. I am glad that they are useful now. To hell with you, Bunduk!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Same quests over and over again. Although they seem interesting at first, the process of completing them is relatively longer and it is kind of a wasted potential. There could have been more quest types if they wanted them to be essential in the gameplay Fortunately you can assign your companions to those quests, nice save. 7/10**

&amp;#x200B;

**MUSIC - OMG BEAUTIFUL 9999/9999**

**CONCLUSION**

the game has a lot to offer. You can tell that the team worked so hard to embellish the game with lots of features but at some point, the game has became a horse with a steering wheel or a motorcycle with monster truck wheels or a bicycle with a spoiler. In its essence, the game is desperately trying to say to you that it is actually Warband, but now it has gone under some plastic surgery and became Bannerlord. Although the surgery seems like it yielded a somewhat successful result; it is still not as genuine as it was before. The game looks like it is confused and it has a long way to go. But I still can say that it started solid and firm enough to move on.

While I am writing this, there is a strong belief/hope in my mind. The game is on early access and it will get better. I know that TaleWorld's team will work hard and save it from becoming an amplified echo of Warband.

When completing a caravan mission, the moment the quest pops up with the reward, I loose Honor (1) from my character sheet. On another character, I didn't pinpoint the cause, but I lost both honorable and daring after doing a bunch of missions.

It make sense that some missions would give or take traits, like if you give money to people you might get generous, or if you kill innocents you should get cruel. But in my observation, traits are only deleted, not added when it makes sense, and the traits being deleted don't really align with the missions being completed.

fskuca,MoonHelm,Curious 'Issue',"I noticed what's in the video happening to all of the NPCs that die, their face turns very low res. I'm not sure if it's there intentionally but here it is just in case. 

At the end of the battle you sorta end up with a buncha corpses with the same face and all of the details removed, its easy to look past it not a big deal honestly- though with all of the intense detail given to this world it stands out a little.

fskth1,NiccoloZaza,"I am going to buy this game(Bannerlord) tomorrow, but...","I have some questions which might affect my opinion on this game(especially the 1st question).

1. Is there a preparation phase before battle? Take Total War for example. Before you start a fight you can actually create formations and army layouts. I don't want to get whacked by AI in the middle of my preparation because sometimes you have tactics in idea and they require time to prepare for. This is the biggest concern for me because I like taking time with strategy games before I start the battle.
2. Can you actually become King/Queen without creating your own faction?
3. Will my PC handle massive battles(1000-1500 men)?  
CPU: AMD Ryzen R5 2600  
GPU: Nvidia GTX 1070

Apparently there's also a limit on how many workshops you can have, which makes this even worse. Standard upkeep on a well developed and high level party is well over 500/day.

fskof0,Herby247,So I think the combat needs work.,"So being pretty experienced in Warband made me think I'd find Bannerlord pretty easy to get used to, but holy shit the blocking controls need work.

I think the same applies to the melee attacks, but it's less inconvenient, because and attack is an attack, regardless of the direction you swing it.

I understand why Taleworlds might not want to include auto-blocking, but unless the combat gets vastly easier (or at least has a setting to make it easier, and yes I have AI difficulty on poor), I can't see I'll be able to play the game without it.

The most obvious example is the city of Sargot located where Veluca stands in Warband. Isn't is supposed to be Sargot in the north? Or is there some in-game lore to it?

Same can be applied to Ocs Hall. It is definitely the city of Uxkhal given the pronunciation and coat of arms.",5,1585685298,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsk7wr/why_is_bannerlords_geography_is_so_strange/,mountandblade,3

fsk4fk,Dewopalis,Forest bandits are amazing and are currently the best troops in the game in my opinion. Here is why,"My friends and I have been playing this game a lot over the last 2 days and have been having a massive issue with Forest Bandits. We kept on having our troops' morale be destroyed by these sharpshooting fucks. Then we figured out that we had less losses when using autocalc to beat them, with the added bonus of getting prisoners.

Then I looked at their stats and HOLY SHIT. 

For reference here's the bow/crossbow proficiency of all the regular troop trees' top tier archers are 130. This is all according to the in-game wiki.
Vlandian Sharpshooter - 130
Sturgian Veteran Bowman - 130
Empire  Imperial Palatine Guard/ Sergeant Crossbowman 130
Aserai Master archer - 130. 

Now here comes the fun. 
Bushwackers become Freeboaters and then Forest Bandits. And forest bandits have an insane 150 bow proficiency!

***And it gets better***
Edit: For these. you need the ""Disciplinarian"" perk under leadership. Which needs a skill of 125. This is still worth it because forest bandits are so strong

Forest Bandits can become Battanian Fians (Which I do not believe you can get from levelling Battanian troops), this troop has a proficiency of 210!

***But wait there's more***

They level up into Battanian Fian Champions. With a proficiency of 280!

For people like me who like to use a shieldwall and to rain down arrows, this is awesome. They are super easy to recruit from your prisoners and they are absurdly powerful.

&amp;#x200B;

 I have received infinite loading screens when entering certain Cities such as Pen Cannoc. The green and red text indicating upgrades and downgrades on weapons has gone back to normal text and no longer changes color. After accepting a quest in Poros to kill bandits in Zestea from the Silversmith, leaving the city freezes the game and crashes it.  


EDIT: New Bug. After receiving a quest to find new employers for mercenaries and the game crashing, I reload and try to talk to nobles and the dialogue bugs into introductions with the persuasion chance bubbles up. Every option I click does nothing and I have to exit to the main menu in order to reset. Gonna try an earlier save and see if something helps.  


EDIT 2: The Persuasion glitch is now happening not only with nobles but also traders and normal NPCs. Looks like my game is now broken.  


EDIT 3: Somehow this affected a save from yesterday and about 3 hours before I accepted the quest and now everything requires a persuasion check. 10 hour utterly down the drain in entirety.  


EDIT 4: I cannot believe this but I guess this bug ended up editing the files from the game because I started a new campaign and upon starting I'm immediately put into the same glitch talking to the brother!

fsjqfm,acetrigga,Updated Cheat Guide - All Cheats That Work,"These cheats all seem to be working.

## How to enable Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord cheats

* First, you'll need to make an edit to a single file. Head to this location on your PC: Documents &gt; Mount and Blade II Bannerlord &gt; **engine\_config.txt**
* Open it with a text editor like Notepad , and look for this line: **cheat\_mode = 0**
* **Change 0 to 1** and save the file.

Once you've done this, launch Bannerlord, and you'll be able to use cheats.

## Items &amp; Money Cheats

With cheats enabled, simply opening your inventory will display a list of every item in the game on the left side of the screen. Just click the arrow next to any item you want and it'll be moved into your inventory. Click Done when you've got everything you want.

We haven't found a specific cheat to add money to your character, but you can load up on expensive items and sell them to vendors to make yourself rich quick.

## Combat cheats

* **Ctrl + F4:** In combat, knocks out the enemy you are looking at. Spam it to take out an entire army!
* **Ctrl + H:** Heals you to full health.
* **Ctrl + Shift + H:** Heals your horse to full health.
* **Ctrl + Alt + F4:** Knocks out all enemies in the field.

## Movement and map cheat

* **Ctrl + left click**: Holding Ctrl while you left click teleports you anywhere on the map you wish to go.

Hope this helps you guys create your perfect RP scenario (that is the reason I personally use cheats) or just simple have some fun!!! XD

The bandit hideout is a lottery that could cost you the whole game. The only ones i do like are the escort merchant because you get a battle and hunt the poachers.

Also is it just me or do the quest with the desserters disappear once you actually get a big army enough to beat it.


 Its the same as Warband.

I'm wondering if this is due to trade caravans giving profits to certain towns people so they become more powerful, therefore having better troops for you to recruit.

Likewise I wonder if raiding villages will make other nearby village leaders more powerful as more caravans are likely to trade there etc.

A lot of us who joined the Mount &amp; Blade community later on in Warband's lifecycle were able to immediately pop into a mostly bug-free, solid game where we could start a campaign in native or any number of highly-developed mods, and be immersed for dozens of hours without major issues.  Anyone expecting to get that same feeling in Bannerlord right now might be in for a rude awakening. This game is Early Access, after all.  

I got a great taste of the game last night with 10 hours played already, and all of us have found various bugs/issues that the community is diligently and helpfully reporting to Tale Worlds, and I know it's all gonna be fixed. Crashes, performance, savefile corruption, imbalances, etc - there's a long road ahead for this game.       

I respect all of you who are grinding through the issues right now and even restarting your campaigns now in this version of the game, encountering &amp; reporting problems, and providing valuable feedback - but I'm gonna go play another campaign of Pendor  instead, and wait for the first major bugfix update, before I hit ""new Campaign"" again in Bannerlord.",8,1585683158,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsjjmt/the_early_access_is_great_but_ill_wait_for_some/,mountandblade,11

fsjbdq,JimSteak,Number Balance improvements I would recommend,"This is a list of easily tweakable things I would recommend changing in terms of gameplay, you’re welcome to add things in the comments. Essentially to balance all this, only numbers in the code would need to be changed.

- balance Archer precision and damage on non-headshots, currently AI archers are mowing you down from really far unexpectedly a lot and it kinda ruins the fun of the game if you have to remain in cover for entire battles.
- decrease the aggressiveness of banditcamp mobs.
- change how much quests affect approval rating negatively. Currently almost every NPC quest has an almost as large negative sympathy point effect on some other NPC, that it is impossible sustainably maintain high relations with more than a few characters.
- increase the pace of the midgame by reducing xp level requirements. After advancing by a level every 20 minutes or so, it slows down suddenly and points only increase 1 by 1, and level progression is notably slower, making the game very grindy.
- increase the cost of mid tier gear. Currently there is a big gap between high tier very expensive gear and mid tier, comparatively cheap gear.
- decrease stagger times or attack speed by just a tiny bit. It’s currently possible to stunlock opponents or be stunlocked.
- increase the mass of soldiers a tiny bit, currently they run into each other too much.
- increase soldier health or decrease damage, close quarter battles are over too quickly.",3,1585682442,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsjbdq/number_balance_improvements_i_would_recommend/,mountandblade,1

fsj2vw,-AustinAllen-,Early Access is not a valid excuse and criticism should be acceptable.,"I want to say this as polite and level headed as I can because I believe screaming and yelling “unplayable” or “fix your shit” is unnecessary. I’m on TaleWorlds side and I’ll support them as much as I can but that doesn’t mean they aren’t allowed to be criticized.

- Quest are extremely repetitive and most are not only bugged but they will prevent you from progressing permanently. 

- The dialog is not only extremely repetitive, it’s borderline glitched in a lot of places. Hence the “insert generic backstory here” pictures. While that’s humorous in a lot of ways it also shows how serious you are taking the development, of lack there of. 

- The new features that are available are almost pointless due to the player not being able to properly use it. IE: Balancing issues with pricing and rewarding. 

- You’ve taken out a lot of positive things from Warband without supplementing it with a better alternative, or at least an explanation as to why you went that way. IE: Auto Block, XP from tournaments

- Everything Is at its bare bone implementation. You still have options in the dialogue menu that lead no where. I’m not sure if this is a design choice or laziness? Why would I ask a lord “can I ask a question” if I would only follow up with “nevermind”.

I played Bannerlord from launch up until now minus 5 hours of sleep and it’s gotten to a point where I won’t play because there’s too many things that prevent you from having any meaningful and enjoyable gameplay. 
I have no doubt that Bannerlord will eventually become a great game. But after 8 years of waiting with little to no communication you put out a product that really can’t even be played correctly. 

I’m not trying to insult the game all I’m saying is that it’s very disappointing and I know you guys can do better.",1316,1585681706,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsj2vw/early_access_is_not_a_valid_excuse_and_criticism/,mountandblade,56
fsj2gi,SolitaireJack,Is the influence system broken or am I just missing something?,"In my current game my influence is being shredded because the Southern Empire I'm signed up to has policies that drain your influence unless you have high charm or are the ruler. As such I can't gain influence to vote to repeal the laws or try and get castles/cities assigned to me so I can actually start earning money outside of raiding and tournaments. 

As far as I can see there are only two ways to gain influence, being in an army and winning battles. Problem is the drain on my influence from the laws is about -2 and being in an army only gets me 0.55

And winning battles only gives you a couple and that's if you're outnumbered. Its not sustainable because eventually I'll have to wait a few days for my army to recover in which time all the influence I had gained is taken away.

fsiz6y,ImnotfamousAMA,Suggestion: Bandit Party Rebalance,"This isn’t a complain about “bandits too op pls nerf”, it’s more about the amount of bandits in the world and how I feel it’s kind of tedious to grind bandits.

As it stands now, unless you’re fresh out of the tutorial, looters aren’t worth that much in terms of drops. But 90-95% of bandit spawns are looters, which means I spend an absurd amount of time just looking for stuff worth my time to kill. 

So I have a suggestion; have hideouts be bandit spawners where you can consistently go and kill new parties of a type of bandits. Have them reset their spawns at the start of every day, and spit out 4-5 new bandit parties until it hits a max number. What this does is put the final piece in for an existing gameplay loop in Warband to be expanded in Bannerlord. 

-I go kill a bunch of bandits

-I loot their weapons and gear

-I sell their gear and scrap their weapons at a nearby town

-I unlock new recipes for blacksmithing

-I smith better weapons for myself

-In the time I was in town, everything should have respawned so I’m free to go back until I’m happy with my gear and money.

fsijcz,bomba_viaje,Names of Months,"Hi all.

I'm a sucker for lore and I noticed that the calendar progresses by season, with the date format being [Season] [Day of Month]. The point of this post is to develop a lore-friendly calendar system to go with this.

This only ever occurred to me because I was planning on making a ledger of some trade good prices in order to possibly establish some profitable trade routes.

So, our calendar has some Roman emperors in it, and I think that the names of Calradian emperors would be great candidates for names of months here. One problem is that I'm digging for lore and I haven't found a comprehensive list of any kind. Obviously I don't expect them to have a whole timeline, I just want to consider every bit of what's canon.

So far, I have:

Spring: Calrad (The founder of the empire, the start of the new year)

Summer: ??? (Ideally a well-remembered powerful emperor, perhaps?)

Autumn: Neretzes (If I understand right, was Neretzes the predecessor of Arenicos...?)

Winter: Arenicos (His death has sparked the succession crisis, and according to canon, this marks the beginning of the end of the Empire.)

I think you can justify having such recent historical figures in the calendar. If we haven't been told otherwise, and let me know if we have, then you could say that the empire was founded 1084 years ago, and Arenicos himself instituted the change as a kind of Sun King hubristic move. The whole empire, wanting to establish the most legitimate claim to his succession, would probably eagerly adopt it. If the whole empire is using it, its neighbors will at least have to be familiar with it to engage in trade and such.

Reply with emperor names so we can have summer, and the other seasons may have even more fitting names too.

Additionally, I'm bad at linguistics, and I don't know the rules on converting from Latin-sounding things to English. (Julius -&gt; July, August -&gt; Augustus, and is October after Octavian?) Would it make more sense to just use the names of the emperors as we have them? I just wanted to consider it.

Thanks for reading this long post about an ultimately trivial detail. I love this game.

TL;DR: What should we name the months in Calradia?

So far I only got a smith which i bought for 15k and left to go questing came back maybe 1 or 2 weeks later and it was worth 25k plus the pay to the purse per day after wages was 1k a day. Though you can only change what you produce or you can sell it you cannot put any inventory in or hold off selling lastly upgrading your workshop which either you have to wait or it has not been implemented. nonetheless it is still quite the profitable venture.

fshjzh,AlfonzoZanzibar,Idea: Open city menu by tapping Tab.,"This is a short post but it's just a small suggestion I had. Since Bannerlord loads you into the world map everytime you want to open the city/town interaction menu it means the game usually takes at best around 3-5 seconds to actually open the menu. My proposal to fix this issue is that, if you are in a city or town, simply tapping the Tab key as opposed to holding it will cause the menu to come up while you're still on the street. That way if you want to go from the tavern to the arena instead of hitting Tab, waiting to load into the world map, then clicking on the arena and waiting to load into there, you would instead open the menu while still inside the tavern then go straight from the tavern to the arena, this getting rid of the double loading screens.",0,1585676989,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fshjzh/idea_open_city_menu_by_tapping_tab/,mountandblade,4

Vlandians get +20% troop xp in battles. To me, this seems OP compared to the bonuses received for other factions (i.e., bonus to movement speed in the snow on the world map for Sturgians). 

I've seen a Youtuber that was going to do a Sturgian playthrough, but he chose to start as a Vlandian due to this. I think that's going to be what a lot of people do. 

I think it would be better to give the Vlandians some other bonus and give the +20% troop xp in battles to the player when they use troops from their own faction.

It make's it more difficult to tell your troops from enemies', obviously, but looks so much better IMO. Also, it stops the banners from friendly troops from covering half of your screen when they are set to follow you, and you stop for a second to line up a bow shot.

As you keep doing this food stock will go to zero - militia will fade away and garrison will die - this means when you go for a siege the morale is between 0 and 10 before you even have to wait usually the game AI come straight out to fight which you clean up with cav very quickly to get a quick and easy fort costing you nothing but making money - currently sat at 300,000 Denars with 22 fiefs",1,1585675760,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsh610/first_tip_when_it_comes_to_raidingsieging_and/,mountandblade,4

I was able to quadruple my savings in couple of weeks by trading between western and southern empires. 

- Check villages and be a on a lookout for good deals. 

- Villages buy and sell at fixed prices, use that to your advantage, one village which I found was buying pack mules for 230g!

- In cities look for goods which they have plenty and check trade rumors. 

- Around Jalmarys are also few horse villages where you can buy lot of pack horses for low prices. 

- Generally, grain is pretty poor way to make a profit, unless city is absolutely starving for it, you'll barely break even.

- Animals, on the other hand, are pretty good since they take no cargo space and don't slow you down, you can flip them easily for double or triple the price you bought them in a village

- While making routes, you can also send your companions on missions and most of your troops with them. You'll make money and save on wages!",4,1585675670,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsh4z9/early_game_tip_trading_is_far_more_profitable/,mountandblade,7

fsh31t,Antrix32,Don't use issues as a reason to give up on the game. Provide feedback and help make the game better.,"I don't believe, like some people say, that the game is simply Warband with better visuals. Theres clearly new features, quality of life improvements and more variety *however* that doesn't mean that the game couldn't use a lot more, and there is clearly room for improvement.

That just makes me want to play the game more, and really get a full understanding of what the game has, and what it needs. I really encourage everyone else to take the time to write out the problems as detailed as possible and post them here or other forums where devs can get the proper feedback.

I know after the time we've waited not everyone agrees with Early Access but its in that state for a reason. I trust Taleworlds enough to actually try to fix things people have an issue with. I'm in agreement that after 8 years you would expect a more finished experience but this is the game in its current state. You can just write it off, or try to help improve it. 

This goes for the reverse as well, just because its Mount &amp; Blade, doesn't mean you have to ignore its short coming. Don't be afraid to criticize issues as long as its constructive.

The bug where you are at war with a minor faction and therefore cannot join any faction has been effecting a lot of people and I found a slightly cheaty fix.

The first step is to download the developer console at \[the nexus\]([https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/4](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/4))

The second step is to go to \\Documents\\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\\Configs  
Open engine\_config, change the cheats value from 0 to 1.

Now open bannerlord, in the launcher go to mods and enable the developer console.

In the main menu click open console, leave this open and load your game.

Once in the game type campaign.make\_peace\_with\_every\_faction and click enter.

Now you are at peace, can join factions again and if you want to disable the cheats just go back to the config and do it. Enjoy drinking from skulls boys.",5,1585675322,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsh141/how_to_fix_the_cannot_join_because_at_war_with/,mountandblade,2

 - How do I take more men with me into a bandit camp raid? Only have 8 or so men doesn't stand up very well when I'm facing off against 20-ish enemies with bows.

 - Do my units have to get the killing blow on an enemy in order to get the XP?

 - How do I level my lance at enemies while charging? I can see the icon in the bottom right show up when I go fast enough, but me character still just stabs like normal.

 - Is there any benefit at all to using a one-handed weapon without a shield? 

 - And, lastly, I can't seem to recruit any captured foes into my army. The button is darkened, but it's not telling me why. I've got space for sure.

you can make 2 at the start, +1(might be more) at each clan tier. 

it seems like spamming dyeworks isnt a good idea anymore.

look at the amount of raw materials available in the town to help you decide what your enterprise should focus on making.

fsgkw6,_cooperscooper_,My Thoughts on the Bannerlord Release,"Imagine buying an early access game at release and then complaining about how the game isn't perfect.    
Jokes aside I think this is a good game. I never write stuff like this or reviews or anything but I feel like I should for this one. At its current state it is basically a remaster of warband with a few added bits like everyone is saying, but people seem to be forgetting that this is literally the first week of its early access release. They are going to be adding more and it seems very hopeful. People seem to be complaining because it took them 8 years to get this game out and it isn't complete yet, but they created a whole new engine for this game and that takes a lot of time and money (which is why other companies like Bethesda are still running on ten year old engines). If TaleWorlds really didn't care about the fans and wasn't planning on releasing a good game then they wouldn't have poured all of their effort into creating a new engine just for this game.    
Many people have also complained about numerous bugs and glitches but I haven't had many glitches aside from it crashing once the first time I downloaded it and I haven't had any performance issues aside from some frame drops during sieges and I am running this on the highest settings on a laptop.    
If you are going to be one of those people who expects perfection then I really urge you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You will only ruin it for yourself so I would recommend that you wait until the full release. This game is fairly basic right now but I think this is lining up to a be a tremendous success and I for one am happy to be a part of this early access journey bugs and all.",0,1585673912,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsgkw6/my_thoughts_on_the_bannerlord_release/,mountandblade,4

Also I didn't even get any prestige or more renown from marrying the Kingdom's princess! King Basically just gave his daughter away to some rich low life.

fsgf63,Robolegs13,In case the devs see this,"First off, it is a good game. Of course there are the typical beta problems, but overall I'm enjoying my experience. There are a few things I think should be changed outside of bugs and balancing issues. Not sure if anything I'm about to list is already planned to be changed but here it goes.

- I've seen the complaints about the arena not giving experience. I find myself waiting in the corner until the end so I can get the 250g payout since there's no reason to actually engage in combat.

- I miss the weekly payout system. Having that as an option would be cool.

- Not being able to move around the map while in the city menu is aggravating.

- Finding the 10 nobles feels like filler. I took me forever to find the 10th guy and then I had to wait even longer because he became imprisoned. 

- This is more of a personal request, but I'd like an option to make the helmet invisible. All that work into the character customizer only to hide my face behind a full faced helm

Just asking this straight-up as sadly there are no worthwhile reviews available as of yet, I found a single one on Youtube but it was obvious the dude played the game for maybe an hour.

Since money is chronically tight, I really can't dish out 40 bucks on an Early Access game, even one [I waited for so long](https://giphy.com/gifs/harry-potter-sirius-black-avoiding-responsibility-rDo7mwGOapCq4) on, without knowing if it's worthwhile or actually just a glorified public Beta.

What new features are there? Is it more like a modded Warband or feels like an entirely revamped game? How much content is there as of yet? Did any popular Warband mod mechanics get featured (especially Diplomacy)? How stable is it running?

Horses increase your cargo capacity. There is no tooltip or hover that I can find that shows they increase campaign map speed.

fsg0tq,OrickJagstone,Opinion: The best way to play early access right now is to join The Southern Empire.,"So, shes kinda bare bones and for sure has a few hiccups. I think that the most fleshed out, most stable, and most enjoyable way to play right now is by joining up with The Southern Empire. 

So hear me out. In Warband I would always start out by joining The Kingdom of the Nords. So obviously when I picked up the new game I ran off to Sturgia to help create it. However, I will say, it seemed very bare bones. I would constantly get the same like three quests (not complaining, they warned us about that) and right now you can't even attack bandit hideouts. This morning I decided I was going to leave the Sturgia and go run off with one of the Empire factions. 

Now, I admit that I've only been working this for a few hours, but I really have found it far more exciting and more fleshed out. Heres a few reasons why.

It could just be me but I feel like there is a much higher variety in quests and characters.

The landscape that changes with the seasons, and the fact that it ranges between open plains to mountains to dense forests makes for more variety in battle.

Also there are three different bandit factions that travel the area. Mountain and forest bandits as well as your run of the mill looters. This keeps things interesting in combat as well as each faction has different strengths and weaknesses that you must adapt too. 

I'm totally intrested in your opinion though. What do you think is the current best faction and why?",4,1585672114,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsg0tq/opinion_the_best_way_to_play_early_access_right/,mountandblade,6

I don't know if you guys have encountered this bug yet, but I have a quest where I have to give the ruler of Vlandians 5 gallant cavalry. I have those, the quest marker has 5 out of 5 ticked off, so I should be good to turn them over to their new liege. 

However, Dethrered (or whatever his name is) won't accept them when I talk to him, and the game only allows me to either say I need more time, or that I am currently working on it, when I try to talk to him about the task. When I try to access the castle commander, the game crashes. 

Any ideas how to do this? Or is the quest broken and so I need to just wait it out and fail the quest when I reach the deadline?

fsfrws,ARKSH7R,Nobles Taken Prisoner as a Mercenary have disappeared. Here's why:,"\-Also Posted to Taleworlds Forums:  


 So this is the tale of Andros, a mercenary Loyal to the Empire. Specifically Rhagaea of the Southern Empire. He fights for a measley 15 denars per battle. That's not really why Andros got involved in her affairs. He really only wanted to ransom nobles to pay his army worth 700 denars a day. That's a high upkeep, and he has to keep em fed and give them the money to bare the long marches across Calradia. Well, Rhagaea found herself at war with battania. No problem for Andros, his heavy cavalry and expert bowmen should do the trick. After a few weeks of chasing down battanian armies and raiding villages, Andros had 49 prisoners, 4 of which were very wealthy Noblemen. On his way back to ransom his quarry, he received the most disheartening news. The war was over. How was he going to feed and keep his 79 Imperial Mercenaries happy? Ah, the prisoners, yes that is right. wait... The Nobles are gone? NOT GOOD! How will he ever pay his men now?  


Sorry to be cringey with the weird external monologue. But i figured it's the most entertaining way to start my discussion off, as well as to rant. Now i Understand that if a war is over, and you're actually part of the faction as a noble of some sort, then you can't just ransom the people off at that point. But Andros is a mercenary! He doesn't care for the politics, he wants MONEY! I think Taleworlds should implement a system to apply to mercenary characters, maybe even nobles too, when the war is over, a popup appears to the player. ""Most fortunate news:the war is over! You still have xyz characters as prisoners, do you keep them for ransom, or do you free them?) At this point the player could choose to keep them, and lose more relations with that characters clan and faction, or release them and gain some relation back and maybe even some Mercy experience. Thoughts? And if you agree, let's try to get the attention of the ol' devs.",0,1585671314,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsfrws/nobles_taken_prisoner_as_a_mercenary_have/,mountandblade,4

fsfped,karoda,How to make FAT STACKS in Bannerlord,"[Oi, you, shut your mouth and look at my wad!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-7v4qnHP8)

  

Out of the goodness of my very, very rich heart, I have come down from my throne made of denars to teach you dung-covered poors how to be rich like me. 

   

Step one is simple: *Don't be poor.* 

It takes money to make money, and as a man with a lot of money, I know all about money. You, a disgusting poor, will need approximately 14,000 denars starting cash.

   

Step two: *A little walking.*

Go to the nearest town (or furthest away, if you're smart and don't want to lose your income to the petty squabbling of poor nobles and their wars) and talk to one of the merchants. Flash your WAD and tell them to buzz off. Hold down ALT and find the nearest shop. It doesn't matter if it's a Pottery Shop, Wool Spinnery, whatever. None of those matter, because they don't make as many fat stacks as your new best friend. Speaking of...

   

Step three: *Capitalism, baby!*

Find the nearest Shop Worker peon and tell him you're buying the place. It's about 14,000 denars, but soon, 14,000 denars will be nothing to you. Turn it into a wood workshop.

   

Step four:*Roll in the money.*

You'll now be rolling in upwards of 1,000 denars per day PER DIEM. That's right, when you make as much money as I do, you can add in random Latin phrases that are totally redundant. Now, go buy another one. 

   

Step five: *Enjoy your fat stacks.*

""But u/Karoda, O Wise One, O Rich One, what can I do with all of this money you have so kindly taught me how to make?"" Shut your mouth, rich people are talking, and you aren't rich yet! Walk around and do whatever you want. Accosted by raiders? Pay them 7,500 denars to fuck off. Want to make your own Super Special Weapon? Buy dozens of swords and break them down into their component parts to min-max your smithing skill. You don't have to worry about turning a profit from it because you're rich now. Long story short, you can do whatever you want now, because when you're the Million Denar Man, [you always get what you want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-cvubMeF2E).

fsfk6c,Stroncium,Characters with focus on passive skills are leveling extremely slow in comparison to combat focused ones. Make sure you have focus/stats at least in one combat area.,"I made two characters.

1 - Heavy focus on leadership, charm, tactics, healing, all the support stuff. He barely has any combat skills and cant even progress his weapon skill anymore, as his vigor is like 1 and all the focus points are spent elsewhere, so his 1 handed /2handed/polearm etc is locked on 10 etc. It took me like 7 hours to get my base leadership from 35 to 36, even with constant high morale and tons of victories. The only way I am currently able to progress is by leveling roguery  by raiding like a madman or autoresolving for tactics. Healing barely moves, leadership as well. After hours and hours, like 50 razed villages and tons of battles, he is level 9.

2 - Combat shield maiden with archery, Literally put everything into one handed, athletics, horse and archery. Just by running around and smacking looters I managed to get to level 9 and get skills like one handed/archery to 80 and more in like 2 hours. Insane difference in leveling speed.

I’m playing at medium settings for a somewhat stable fps, except for the massive stutters in singleplayer.

Well I’d like to ask you guys if you have the same performance issues. I’m guessing it’s probably mainly because of the massive world map.

I do know that this is a very early build, but I am curious how it performs in other systems.

By the way, I have an i5 7600K and a GTX 1060 3gb.

It’s also probably because I was spoiled by the huge battles in Pendor with smooth frames lol

fsf868,Arenshii,Is it bad that I expected more of this game?,"I don't know, after 7+ years of development I just assumed that the SP had progressed a little bit further from Warband. I wish that:

\- Questgivers had more lines than the same repetitive ones. There's little to no immersion if every NPC says the same line on which my character gives the same answer, imho.

\- More variation of quests than just the same 3-4 that repeat over and over again. Kill nearby bandits, find runaway daughter, escort caravan, ...

\- There was a co-op option available.

\- Tournament loot could be more varied,  I've received the same sword, Early Retirement (or what's it called), 4 times in a row now.

\- The AI was better

\- During Tournaments you get XP? 

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff that I really like are:

\- Character customization, seriously it's one of the best I've seen in games.

\- Graphics

\- Combat

fsf2l7,Vetinarius,Tips &amp; Tricks Thread,"Yo butterlords, i thought a tips and tricks thread would be quite helpful. Let us try and compile the most useful info here.

I'll start:

**Bugs and how to avoid them:**

1. Poacher Army quest is sometimes bugged and you get -1 Days to complete. - Dont take these quests
2. Sending units + a companion to a Quest does sometimes not work. I lost one companion this way, he never returned. (You can kick them from your clan though and take a new one, in clan window it says HOLDING under the companion) My guess is that they got defeated, taken prisoner and then the looter/bandit party got killed. - Just do the quests yourself.
3. While finding the Banner pieces i had to raid one bandit camp multiple times until i got the quest update.
4. Loot Value is a bit awkward, if there are multiple pieces of gear (lets say 5 times the same boots) the value seemingly increases after looting one. e.g. there are 5 leather boots at 40gold each, i take one, now there are 4 leather boots at 120 gold each. This only occurs during looting, while selling alls 5 boots are worth 40 gold each.


**Things i thought was a bug:**

1. During the ""Talk to 10 Lords"" quest i had to talk to someone i couldn't find. Turns out he was a lower clan member, and just chilling in a throne room, you only see who is inside the keep once you bribe your way in.
2. If you send a companion on a quest it sometimes takes up to a few days for them to return upon completion (beware, sometimes they truly bug out see #2 above)
3. Not sure about this one, but bandit camps don't despawn, you can raid them over and over again. 

**General Tips:**

1. Each Culture has it's own Minigame in Tavern, seems to be dependant on tavern scene. The Empire-Boardgame is ridiculously easy to win. Play as Defender, bet 500g and just move around until the enemy makes a mistake and you can take their pieces. Your King piece is invincible as long as you dont move it out of the center. Easy 500g every tavern. I can reliably win this minigame in under 1 minute, all the other games are much harder IMO.
2. If you walk through a Village/City press LAlt to highlight people/places. In cities it also shows production building, which you can buy.
3. Combat AI in 1v1 fights is barebones, you can easily win tournament 1v1s by hugging the enemy, keep them on your left, circly them and swing from the left contantly. Sometimes you even bypass their sield this way (might be a bug).
4. Buy lots and lots of horses, horses make your party move faster. If you have an army of 30 peasants with 30 horses in your inventory you can outrun those looters. The bonus for actually having cavalry seems to be even higher.
5. Once you find a companion with high medic skill, or a companion with high scouting, assign them the corresponding role in your clan tab (L), only then are the bonuses applied party-wide.
6. There are some lances that can be crouched, but they don't do it automaticly like in warband, you have to press x once you have enough speed, there is a little indicator above your HP bar, if you can crouch it.

fseucb,Hedoniics,Crash to Desktop on Initial Load,"Hello warriors!

I had been plagued by an issue where the game would just shut down after clicking play in the launcher on the front loading screen. Tried every fix all over the interwebs to get past it and I finally found one that worked. Copying and pasting the fellas steam post here so maybe it can help some other poor soul:

""I have found a solution to crash in loading screen at start

It is a crash to desktop without an error message while in loading screen (running horse bottom right corner). So it is different than more common crash at launch. It may not work for you!

I have tried everything but nothing has worked. Then, i have started investigate ""rgl_log_7092.txt"" at ""C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\logs"" . After the last line, there is no loading message and it ends. The file in the last line was ""std_TaleWorlds_CampaignSystem-zho-CN.xml"". I have just delete it which locates at ""C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Mount &amp; Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\SandBox\ModuleData\Languages\CN"".

After that, game was able to get to the main menu without crashing. I have played a little, everything looks fine so far.

This solution may cause some other problems in the game since we are deleting a file yet it is much better than not playing it at all.

Hope it works for you too""

It seems like the file is a language file so should be superfluous,but what do I know about coding? Absolutely nothing. And thank you to Barbasan on steam for the detective work!",1,1585668286,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fseucb/crash_to_desktop_on_initial_load/,mountandblade,3

fseoo0,NegativeVibes66,WHAT TO AVOID (Bugs in Bannerlord's Current State),"Sea raider hideouts will cause your game to either crash, or be put into an infinite load screen.

Poacher quests will cause your game to consistently freeze upon failure and in most cases don't spawn the required enemies to complete it in the first place. This can potentially lead your saves with this quest unable to proceed past a certain date in game.

When doing a quest to retrieve someone's daughter from a kidnapper, if you ask a member of the townsfolk where they are, make sure you dismiss their directions or allow them to give their final dialogue once you meet the daughter in question. This will usually be along the lines of ""here they are, yadda yadda yadda."" If you do not do this, you can likely be put into a dialogue menu between both the daughter/kidnapper and the the member of the townsfolk at the same time if the townsfolk initiated the aforementioned final dialogue while you were speaking to the daughter. You will have to close your game to exit this.

This is just what I found during my current playthrough that made my experience less enjoyable and even left me to reload an earlier save just to continue playing. Please add to this list to let other players know how to avoid their experience being ruined and hopefully some patches will come out soon. :)",3,1585667767,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fseoo0/what_to_avoid_bugs_in_bannerlords_current_state/,mountandblade,6

fsemdx,Sswordy,“Is Bannerlord as good as Warband? Should I buy it?” — My detailed review,"*Summary at the bottom.  Full review and details at the top.  I bolded keywords to make my paragraphs a bit easier to skim.

The world seems way more immersive to me.  In the first village, I spent a good 15 minutes running around admiring the **scenery** (it looks like a legit village with occupations and real people and kids and animals running around) and the **animations** (people walk, stretch, talk, play, sit, scratch.  People look at each other as they pass, and it doesn’t look awkward.  People walked/dodged around me if I stood on my horse in their path.  Horses look amazing.  There were pigs, chickens, geese, sheep, cows... all of which had really nice animations.  Nothing major, just appropriate and subtle life.  The grass moved around things as they walked through the grass.  I later saw people fiddling with their weapons while holding position in battle).  For **immersion**, I wondered to myself if I could interact with things, so I tried killing a pig... it took damage, squealed, bled all over, ran away, and I was able to kill it.  Only unrealistic thing was no one yelled at me for it, but it was the tutorial, so that may have been temporarily disabled... I haven’t tried again.  Overall, the weirdest thing I’ve encountered so far is that troops default to starting combat in “hold position, don’t fight back, don’t shoot ammo” status, and you could easily get them all killed if you didn’t tell them something else to do fast enough... but a simple f1-f3 fixes that, if nothing else.

I played 8 hours yesterday in a single session on the **best graphics settings**.  I have an excellent PC, and it **only crashed once** (and I knew I was doing something that seemed unintended at the time).  I did notice a few things that seemed indicative of early access, such as reused scenes in different towns and other bugs so minor I can hardly remember them now (stuff like mini graphics glitches when I move my mouse just so, easily avoided).  **Character creation** is absolutely the best... no more need for spreadsheets from the wiki to see what each choice gives you; all is made explicit at each step, and you can watch your character sheet develop as you make choices.  **Quests** I’ve gotten so far seem like they come from a fairly small pool, but no worse than Warband.  I really appreciated a couple quests where I was honestly torn between multiple choices I had; the game actually challenged me!  The “main questline” seems really useful and interesting so far: useful as a guide/gentle tutorial of how to advance in the game, and yet totally ignorable after the tutorial bandit fight.  **Trading** is way more fun and viable due to the way trade rumors work and how having more horses increases inventory capacity.  Also, you can move around while over capacity on both inventory and prisoners, although there are disadvantages.  **Persuasion** seems neat, a definite upgrade, though perhaps not “great” yet.  **Combat**, personally, I have been really enjoying.  I’ve had a few extra hours practicing with the new system on the beta, but at this point I’m used to the differences and I enjoy how fluid Bannerlord combat is.  I adore how **Leveling** works now: you gain xp based on actions done, damage dealt, success/practice at various tasks (think: trading, moving quickly, leading large armies), and not from “kills.”  This means partial kill credit gives you xp, and you can also literally level from trading successfully, or other traditionally non-xp actions from Warband.

The **Difficulty** level seems spot on for how I want to play right now.  I chose all the easiest settings, and I haven’t felt incapable of advancing, yet it also hasn’t been trivially easy.  Making gold has taken some thought, since easy bandits don’t give good loot.  I took a “protect the village” quest and was attacked by a party of 28 steppe bandits, half of which were competent horse archers, and was completely massacred the first time.  After a savescum, I tried a more defensive tactic, hiding in the town, getting help from the villagers, and I was able to win, but at the cost of most of my (already small) party.  I felt elated!  Challenged!  We won, but with bad losses.  I think more people think the game is too hard than too easy, but I’m not having a bad time while playing aggressively on easiest settings.  I think the realistic settings would require much more conservative play, but that’s “realistic,” imo, and is exactly as it should be.  After 8 hours of gameplay, I have a party of 20 low level horse archers, 2 companions, and I’m not scared of steppe bandits, but don’t consider them trivial yet.  I’m currently focusing on a bit of trade to make money, and I’m loving everything about the experience.

My biggest **complaints** are just that certain things are missing.  Some are mild, silly things, like I can’t find a way to indicate North on the map, and that the Encyclopedia doesn’t have any noticeable button to open it (it’s honestly a rather hidden feature, atm).  Some are the bigger complaints, like that you can’t create your own kingdom yet (Edit: a commenter says it may actually be possible, but is limited), or get married and have kids (this may just be a short term bug, not sure).  **Bugs** abound, and some are trivial visual glitches and some effectively disable key features (I’ve heard of sieges and marriages being bugged, haven’t tested myself).  These things did not remotely impede my enjoyment for my first 8 hours, and my understanding is that sieges and marriages (but not children) are supposed to be implemented already, and will be troubleshooted aggressively... thus I expect they will be there by the time I am interested in them.

**Summary:**

Ive been saying this a lot: Bannerlord is early access!  It’s very buggy and many features are missing or half implemented, but I absolutely love it anyways.  I highly recommend you do *not* play it yet if you think you’ll be upset by these things (come back in a few months or 1 year).  That said, Warband was at this point once too, so if you are willing to do a little bug reporting without losing your morale, please join us in Bannerlord!

Personally, I rate the day 1 experience of this game as already an 8/10, with 100% faith that it’ll be a 10/10 in the near future.  I don’t think I’ll ever go back to Warband, even once, unless something catastrophic happens and Bannerlord is never completed and left unmoddable.  Bannerlord is *so much more* immersive and beautiful and has so many huge quality of life improvements and good new features.

So I am one of the people still working despite coronavirus, so have only played about an hour of Bannerlord. My experience has been all right so far, initially some stutters but after tweaking settings it's running ok and I am enjoying myself. 

That said, despite some improvements (eg imo horse archery feels much better and more satisfying)  it seems quite similar to warband in the early game, which is fine because the early game is what everyone loved about warband. My question is, to those people who've been playing all day, what's it like later into the game? Has life as a vassal changed much? How are sieges? Etc.

I'm not up to that bit, but it's probably the make or break of the game for me, so even though I'll get up to it sooner or later, my work means it might take a while, so I want to hear people's input so I can get an idea.

fseen7,cute-girl-in-a-dress,I know the game is still in ealry access....,"...but there seems to be core gameplay issues im afraid will get ignored.

- Blocking

Specifically blocking without a shield is the one of the most unreliable, frustrating, and frankly unfair parts of the game. I want blocking with a shield to be more forgiving and offer more protection, which is the whole point. But god blocking without one is awful. I don't know what it is but i can call the direction of the attack correctly 5 times in a row and still take the hit. The blocking needs a rework, i would argue over anything else. Im not slow, i play with the mightiest of twitch no lifes (like myself) with over 1000 hours in Mordhau. Im not new to this series either, i have 1000 hours in warband. 

- non-existent flinch

When you land a strike on an enemy they should flinch. When in the training yard/tutorial enemies flinch when hit. When in the campaign enemies will almost always strike you regardless of taking damage. It just turns into mindless button mashing since blocking is atrocious with the added punishment of the lack of flinch.

I love mount and blade and i know its a work on progress but this is honestly a game breaker for me. Combat is most of the game and it doesn't work.",8,1585666860,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fseen7/i_know_the_game_is_still_in_ealry_access/,mountandblade,2

fse367,Yohlo,"PSA: ""Army of Poachers"" Crash Bug FIX","Last night after about 12 hours of gameplay, I ran into the crash bug that occurs when the ""Army of Poachers"" quest either expires or is setup with a negative number of days remaining (for me it was -1). What would happen is that I had a save from right after I accepted the quest. Whenever I would load that save, it would crash after about 4 seconds of map time with the clock running on standard speed. I noticed that the crash was always a consistent amount of time after loading the save, and that creating a new save would give me that same amount of time before crashing.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's how I fixed it:

* Enable Cheat Mode by navigating to ""Documents\\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\\Configs"" and edit ""engine\_config.txt"" Change the line ""cheat\_mode = 0"" to ""cheat\_mode = 1""
* Load your save. Immediately Ctrl+RMB Click to an area next to the town you have the quest for. This will teleport you there. Save immediately. Do not run the map clock.
* Load the save you just made. Run the clock on standard speed for about 3 seconds (or however long, just so long as you're not crashing). Save. Load the new save. Repeat until it's midnight. (You don't even have to do this step if it's already midnight for you)
* Enter the new town and attack the poachers.
* Save the game. Exit the game. Disable Cheat mode. Drink from skulls.

The whole process took me about 20 minutes since I was very early morning when this happened to me. Well worth it to me since the only other save I had before that was around 110 in-game days before. 

  
If you're reading this and decide to not take on the ""Army of Poachers"" quest, I wouldn't worry. That quest is absolutely the most cash-positive quest right now and I had done it maybe a dozen times before this incident. What you should do if you see the quest and want to take it is: save BEFORE accepting it, accept it, make sure the days remaining isn't negative. If it is bugged, just reload your save you just made and carry on. I will still be accepting these quests!

&amp;#x200B;

fsdxk6,overthinking24,New player here to the series.How do I recruit better units from nobles who don’t offer a quest or task to improve your standing with them.,"Been playing the game for a couple of hours and  I’m off to good start I think.I’ve managed to create a party of 23 men with 4000 gold in my coffers.Yet I want to recruit horsemen which I am guessing are a higher tier unit that can only be recruited from nobles with whom you have good standing or reputation.
Yet almost every noble in every town I’ve been to has no quest or other options to improve your reputation.
Any ideas on what I should do?

fsdv8e,RavagedBody,Spy mission caution,"I'm having such a blast so far, but just wanted to potentially save some of you some time with a certain quest. 

There's a spy quest where you have to wander about a town and ask people about a suspect. You get three clues which for me were  &gt;!'isn't bald, has a beard, has no face markings.'!&lt; However, such a person was NOWHERE in the town. I ended up saving, picking the nearest looking dude to the description that there was, then failing because it was still wrong. Then when I reloaded, there were no suspects at all. They just never appear again. So I fail it anyway. Not the end of the world obviously, but I wasted about an hour on it all told.  


Now, one thing I did do which might have upset things was &gt;!join and win a tournament before investigating. Since the reason given for the spy being there at the time was that he was participating in the tournament, I wonder if this fucks it up? Do the investigation before doing the tournament if you come across this quest I think.!&lt;",2,1585664933,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsdv8e/spy_mission_caution/,mountandblade,1

fsdtdd,the_real_barbasan,I have found a solution to crash in loading screen at start,"It is a crash to desktop without an error message while in loading screen (running horse bottom right corner). So it is different than more common crash at launch. It may not work for you!

I have tried everything but nothing has worked. Then, i have started investigate ""rgl_log_7092.txt"" at ""C:\ProgramData\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\logs"" . After the last line, there is no loading message and it ends. The file in the last line was ""std_TaleWorlds_CampaignSystem-zho-CN.xml"". I have just delete it which locates at ""C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Mount &amp; Blade II Bannerlord\Modules\SandBox\ModuleData\Languages\CN"".

After that, game was able to get to the main menu without crashing. I have played a little, everything looks fine so far.

This solution may cause some other problems in the game since we are deleting a file yet it is much better than not playing it at all. 

Hope it works for you too

fsdp7u,IfTheG1oveDontFit,Lets not turn into an echo chamber,"Just to be clear I absolutely love Bannerlord, its prob the best game I played in the past year.  But I  noticed lately that any criticism of the game gets heavily downvoted with a bunch of people saying ""ITS EARLY ACCESS"" as if it's an excuse for all the games issues. 

Watching streamers played it shows how someone outside the fanbase feel about the game and a lot of them who are new players seem really frustrated with all the bugs and the lack of progress and features even if it is early access. An example is one I was watching who said they felt it was a good game for 2012 but not 2020.  

Obviously if someone is just ranting saying the game is shit they can be ignored but well reasoned criticism should be accepted as it actually helps the devs!

fsd77g,slothofpersia,Played for 3 hours before I hit a game breaking bug,"Hi gang, just curious to see how many people have hit a game breaking bug which they cannot resolve short of starting a new campaign.

I completed the tutorial and was loving the small skirmishes with bandits and looters as a built up my warband. I ran from town to town starting and completing quests. I made the foolish decision of not creating multiple saves and ran into a bug which rendered my save useless. 

I know it is early access but from what I can tell the reason my game is crashing to desktop at a certain time every day is because I fail to complete a random quest for one of the town NPCS. I can't complete the quest because all of my saves are too far away to travel to the location to complete the quest. 

Why did they have many months of public multiplayer testing but no time for single player? This is what the majority of the fanbase is buying the game for and it is littered with bugs and crashes ( [https://steamcommunity.com/app/261550/discussions/0/2149847049317941406/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/261550/discussions/0/2149847049317941406/) )

I don't know what the point of this post is apart from saying BACK UP YOUR SAVES and to the dev team please focus on fixing all the bugs before you implement new features because I am positive eventually all of the current players saves will be rendered useless in the current state.",3,1585662461,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsd77g/played_for_3_hours_before_i_hit_a_game_breaking/,mountandblade,1
fsd75a,Mousseaulini,10 hours into the game with realistic settings. Suggestions.,"Hey there,

i was looking forward to play bannerlord since its announcement and finally it is here to enjoy, and i really do enjoy it. I am also glad that for me the game is working nearly bug-free, which apparently makes me a lucky fella. 

I tried it out for 10 hours now with 2 different characters, though not yet with having a fief. All the campaign options are set to realistic, because i expected that to play out similar as in Warband. However, there a some gameplay-related things that i would hope to be adressed somewhere in the future, which i will point out now. If that is related to the settings or if i missed out a feature, please let me know and forgive my mistakes.

**1: AI going full Blitzkrieg.**

While it is nice to not have the Factions  just sharing Dhirim and Halmar between each other all the time, they are really going overkill right now. Within 2 ingame years, in both of my games theres already one to two factions that got completely screwed by their opponents, and especially one opponent only. In my current run Battania overran the Western Empire whilst the Northern Empire killed of the entire Khuzait realm. In the other run i was the Khuzait who smashed the Northern Empire away, so its probably not a balance issue, but rather one guy winning and then facing no real opposition against his conquest anymore whilst going full aggressive.

&amp;#x200B;

**2: How to train?**

In Warband there was the passive skill that daily trained your army a bit. Something like that or the ability to maybe drill whilst waiting inside a town instead would really be helpful. I find myself recruiting the usual T1 guys and really struggle leveling them that i would have a decent party if i dont just go hunt looters all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**3: party map speed:**

Even with only &lt;30 men parties packed up with 10 mules and not carrying very much other than supplies, i barely keep up with said looters or bandits. Meanwhile, some lords with 3digit troop numbers manage to catch up to me. Is there some perk i am missing out (or probably havent skilled up far enough yet) or do i have to give like 1 horse per soldier to hold up with speed?

&amp;#x200B;

**4: morale break**

That is probably the conclusion of settings and that i struggle to have battles often enough (3) and lack leader perks/ a full blown supplies buffet for 20 men but my morale is peaking at like 65. Compared to my Warband armies thats a horrible score, where base morale was dependent on the army size itself as well. That sometimes results in my people to just run off the battlefield right after the first melee clash. 

I mean, i get it, but thats like my men didnt even try. And as the cherry on that shitshow of a battle my companion who chickened out and left me to be knocked out afterwards tells me that fleeing a battle is a shameful display. (damn you, Uln Breakskull, next time you try to lecture me i will break your skull and drink from it!!!!!! )

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, i still enjoy it - just trying to give some constructive criticism..",7,1585662456,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsd75a/10_hours_into_the_game_with_realistic_settings/,mountandblade,1

However, you can now no longer join a Faction unless THEY are at war with that clan. Also, you cant make peace with them it seems, even when talking to them. This is a problem if say your at a war with the Lake Rats, who are at war with Sturgia, but you want to join the Western Empire. The western empire has no beef with Lake Rats, which limits you to only joining Sturgia. 

Anyone see a solution to this? What im about to attempt is maybe join Sturgia (assuming its the same as warband, i doubt it), then ill leave immediately and relations should go back to 0.

[Joined an easy siege \(nearly 400 allies\) and saw it get completely annihilated purely because of AI glitches. The image is of the last remaining units stuck on a ladder - half of the force was stuck there and fast forwarding only meant that some units bugged through - running into the last defenders \(a group of maybe 10 people\) one by one, slowly but surely decimating all of the army. At this point I've fast forwarded to 2+ hours of battle time and not even single units can escape the glitched stairs. Guess only thing I can do at all is to abandon the battle \(guessing that will mean faction penalties\). Experiencing this and many other interactions, TaleWorlds should reaaaally focus on fixing the AI for the full release. Lots of gamebreaking stuff purely from AI problems.](https://preview.redd.it/pbq610a0e0q41.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fdb5b911ea0b66606cc795c046797d24f0b4d31)",2,1585661254,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fscw7q/ai_in_sieges_is_currentlylacking/,mountandblade,1

Is there are optimal amount of horses to have in your inventory per party size? i.e if I have a party of 20 should I have 2 horses, 5 horses, 10 horses or a horse for every unit?

My pc is not as great as others, but all the recommend requirements were respected. Still, in campaign mode, the game evidenced lags even at low settings and low audio quality. Even battling against small bandit bands was an agony. Then I had an idea and tried the custom battle mode, 250 vs 250 men, and lag disappeared, the game ran very well with a normal frame rate. So I thought that this is because the custom battles were since the beta period and were optimized. Campaign has been just released, we have to wait some times before TW staff improves it. 

Even with all these problems I see in the bannerlord campain an huge step for the M&amp;B franchise, because everything has been improved without losing what made Warband great. I enjoy it and i look forward for the bug fixes and optimization that would confirm all the potential of the game.

We can switch difficult during play and even constantly save our game (I don't though). This became a big issue for me when I was destroyed - dragged around as a prisoner multiple times. It's a problem because there was a real challenge in regaining a foothold and yet I get no recognition for getting out of a tough situation without reloading a save when I had plenty coin. 

I ask that the game offers players the ability to show-off by ranking us on individual tables for each difficulty level. An option to lock difficulty settings would need to be activated to enter the league. 

What about Steam - surely there will be Steam achievements per difficult level and if so that would need a difficulty-lock and shadowplay?",7,1585658929,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fscbh1/path_to_glory_make_it_public_and_make_it_mean/,mountandblade,1

fscb03,The_Love_Pudding,Army of poachers TEMPORARY FIX!," I kept crashing after accepting the quest and spending a few seconds on the world map. I figured out a temporary fix for this quest.  


1. Enable the cheats for the game (google the instructions)  
2. Then you have to teleport really close to the quest village  
3. Fast forward just 1-2 seconds and then pause (before the game crashes again)  
4. Save the game (make a new save file for this experiment just in case)  
5. Load your new save (this ""resets"" the time you have left before the crash happens)  
6. Repeat these steps until it is midnight  
7. Deal with the poachers and finish the quest  
8. Now that quest is done and it won't crash the game anymore",2,1585658869,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fscb03/army_of_poachers_temporary_fix/,mountandblade,1

Good luck getting turned into a fucking pin cushion.

Ugh, I needed to get that out. 

Now, in all seriousness: Have you guys figured out how to choose which troops to use in hideouts? Or have someone maybe made a mod that does this already?

So what are we left with? A lot of the dialogue is the exact same from the previous game without even having a single voice line, no harvesting season, no drinking from skulls. 

From what I've heard many of the new features that were being added have been delayed or removed in one way or another. The game is currently ""very positive"" on steam although probably more than half of the positive reviews are people with 10 min of playtime saying ""butter"" or ""harvesting season is here""

I know it's in EA but that doesn't change the fact that so much is lacking. And what can they really do in 1 year of EA that they couldn't in 8.

fsbpro,Pirus151,Performence issues (looking for advices/sharing experience).,"GTX 970 Strix OC/8GB RAM/i5 3570 4x3.5Ghz/HDD/Win 7 64bit

Major problem is performence during battles. When my units and enemy units starting to come close and they strating to fight huge fps drops start to happen. It's stuttering as hell, esspecially during attack animation so I can't even attack properly. What I discovered is Custom Battles works much better than campaing ones, even if I set custom battles to 200 soldiers on each side, while campaing battles that I'm talking are usually 20v20. What is the casue of that?  


PC is totally chilled, after 2h of struggle, trying to play the game PC does not jump on any temperature. I've tried to look for some performence fixes and stuff and the only things that I found are lowering audio bitrate to 128 and turning off VSync with setting FPS cap to 60. It does help in some ways, but not really.

&amp;#x200B;

There is really not much of a difference if I'll set graphics to low or high, stutters stay the same, FPS drops stay the same. Also, after turning off the game I need like 2-3 minutes for my PC to come out of lag, while RAM Usage and CPU % is nearly 0 (CPU usage is literally on 0).  


What it does reminds me is memory leak or wrong RAM allocation. Some time ago there wa similar problem in For Honor, where game allocated memory wrongly and there was similar FPS drops during gameplay and lag after turning game off.  


I don't know if I can do something on my own or should I wait for patches. Is there any statement from devs about performence? On steam there is a huge post about issues and memory allocation is listed there. Also, vast majority of negative reviews on steam are about performence, including guys with better PC than mine.  


Few other games that I can play on high setting with no problem which I find somehow more demanding than this game:  
1. Witcher 3

2. GTA 5

3. Kingdome Come (after some tweaks due to SDD recomendation)

4. For Honor

5. Conan Path of Exiles

6. Black Desert

1. It is impossible to split a stack of troops outside of the battle
2. It is impossible to make custom troop groups with custom names, such as ""Archers 1"" or ""Archers 2"".
3. The camera rotates when making the left-button-drag placement, which often results in the spot hiding behind some hill and the cursor landing in the wrong spot because of that. Also, it takes a lot of time because of that playing with terrain. In my opinion, camera should stop rotating when placing it, so you could just drag it from point A to point B like in Total War.
4. The commands menu uses left and right mouse buttons, which makes it impossible to use shield.

fsb8ds,Kainsmasquerade,Some questions about Bannerlord. Please help to stop my confusion.,"I have multiple questions regarding Bannerlord and I hope some of you aren't as incompetent as I am.

1. How do I improve relations with my companions? Is it necessary? And is there a way to level them up?
2. I own a brewery and a trade caravan, but both produce so little wealth, that it's a shame. Is there a way to make them more profitable or is it quantity over quality?
3. Why should I form a second party? It just costs money and I couldn't find a way to give them commands.
4. Is there a way to skip the talk with looters and directly attack them?
5. Every time I start a battle it's in first person, but beard and helmet are blocking my view. Anyone else having this bug? How did you solve it? (There's an option in the main menu, but it doesn't work)
6. Is there a way to see the whole troop tree of a faction? I just discovered, that I can recruit equites now (and upgrade them to cataphracts). It would be helpful to see which other units I missed until now.

I'm sure I have a million more questions, but that's all for now. Thanks in advance and raid on.",6,1585653875,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsb8ds/some_questions_about_bannerlord_please_help_to/,mountandblade,1

""Spot tracks and hideouts"" How do you even SPOT anything?
I'm 10 hours in and at level 13...Wtf.

Another one is ""Charm"" - ""Improve relations. Socialize with nobles. Do barters"" - How do you do barters?

fsazn9,THTLK,Will it ever be possible to make an (GOOD) online/coop campaign?,"I have a lot of friends who plays M&amp;B and after some hours of playing together in the multiplayer in Bannerlord we obviously had to try  single player. The single player is AWESOME. 

But there is one thing, that I always wanted, since I started playing Warband 8 years ago. And it is to play coop campaign. Like do sieges together, hunt bandits, go to war, maybe even fight for different factions. I KNOW that there was a mod in Warband where your friends could join your battles, and you could stream, so he could follow you travel the map, talk to people etc.. but it is kinda boring to watch this in the longer run. 

I really wish for an online/coop campaign, where each person could manage their own lord on the map. But I’ve concluded that this is IMPOSSIBLE to do without ruining the game. 

But here are two solutions, that could make the online/coop campaign possible:

1) each person could take turns. 
Like in Total War and Sid Meier‘s and other games. This solution doesn’t solve the problem and would obviously be boring for example when someone chases some bandits and have to wait x rounds before they reach them. 

2) the map is ONLY in realistic time and you CANNOT fast forward.
This would make it possible for all lords to do what they want, without having to stop other from doing what they want. While you trade in Battania your friend completes quests in Vlandia. The b*tch in this is that it would physically kill each player when they do sieges and other stuff that takes a lot of in-game time. MAYBE this could be fixed by cut the waiting time down from these things, but tbh I don’t know if this would ruin the game. Another problem with this solution would be what to do, when a player picked lord is fighting and in battle. Can the others just join, or should they be safe and other players should not be able to join? 

Here were some of my thoughts. What do you think?",7,1585652700,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsazn9/will_it_ever_be_possible_to_make_an_good/,mountandblade,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I like being a knight, because it's cool. I was thinking of going with the biggest polearm, 2 hander and sword the world has ever seen, my thinking being that I use the lance to run around the battlefield, the 2h for when I stop next to some infantry and shield and 1h if I get my horse killed. But, I feel like I have very little impact with the lance, that I need a full minute to run enough away to have room to gallop into the enemy with the couched lance (because I need to wait for speed THEN press X just so my guy leaves the lance parallel to the ground...) I'm sure there's a better way, also I find myself getting hit a lot when I do this, and even missing, so if anyone has any tips on how to do any of this well.

&amp;#x200B;

And then if anyone had any tips on troop orders I'd appreciate them, I know f1+f3 is usually effective when you'd win regardless of what you did but I think it'd be fun to think a bit more about it.

Will there be such a feature in Bannerlord? I'd like to imagine it to be a nice net of powerplay and politics for the early-mid-game where the player is nowhere near the rank of a noble.  
Maybe there is a reputation to how honourable and reliable your company is and depending on your reputation maybe characters you haven't the best relation with will send a merc company after you?  
How cool wouldn't it be to face a rival merc company in the service of another lord in battle etc...

However the villager interrupted the whole process with her own speech bubbles and I couldn't click her off.

I am not a PC gamer by any means and usually play console. I have no knowledge about how to set up a gaming PC and I reckon my current computer is...average though I don't know how good it will be for playing this game. So is there any way for me to find out if my computer can play this game well. Or should I wait for a console release?


Also how many men can I have the battlefield at once, I saw a video saying a thousand, would there be any way for that to be increased any higher or would I need to install mods.

Also, I see people hating on it and complaining about lack of features but so far it is better than what I was expecting, considering that it's early access.

fsa573,Abzat,Trading: How to make easy money in the early game.,"I've been doing some trading in the game and I feel like I have come up with a system to make some easy money in the game. This isn't based on caravans or workshops, becaus I havent dabbled with them yet. Just pure bartering in the shops. 

**Step 1: Find three cities**

The first step is finding three large cities in close proximity to each other. It shouldn't take more then a day to travel from one city to another. It also helps if they are in a straight line, because it makes it easier to streamline the proces. For this guide I have picked: Quyaz (City A), Sanala (City B), Qasira (City C). 

**Step 2: Travel to these cities.** 

Before you will be able to trade items you actually need to know the prices in these cities. Bannerlord has added some great QoL features that make trading a lot easier. So all you have to do first is going to the city entering it shops and then leaving. Do this for all the cities. The final city you will be able to start trading. (Note: I am in city C for this next part)

**Step 3: Trade!**

In the shops turn the filter on misc items and filter the price on lowest value first: 

https://preview.redd.it/uxxub5jh9zp41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29753eb1cf75aaf3bb438d753eaf07c16d660663

Now, hover over the price of all the items slowly. It will say one of three thing: Sells in City A/B for X (Meaning you will be able to sell it for a profit.), Buy in city A/B for X (Meaning you can buy it cheaper elsewhere.) or it will say nothing(meaning the prices across cities are roughly the same.) We absolutely want to make profit so keep an eye out for **""Sells for X"".** 

I choose flax for my example:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sk5ji82nazp41.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68f44c94d0d84296e471a2c65db559328698fcb4

As you can see I can buy it for 8 (The green colour means it is a cheap price, yellow means average and red is expensive.) and sell it for 12 at City B. So let's buy some and bring it to the next city. **WATCH OUT THAT YOU DON'T INCREASE THE PRICE TOO MUCH.** As you buy more off the stuff the shops supply runs low and it gets more expensive. If this happens then make sure you atleast buy it for cheaper then you would sell it in the other city. **I bought 173 flax for a price of 1445.**

**Step 4: Sell and repeat.**

Now just travel to city B and sell your stuff. I sold the flax for a price of **1689.** This may seems like low, but as you increase your wealth you can buy more and more stuff, sometimes an items sells for double the price in another city. So just rinse and repeat. 

**TIPS**

\- Buy Mules/Horses. Every mule/horses increases your carry weight by 100. I have 25 mules now.

\- Have a ""caravan guard"". So just make sure you have enough troops to not get attacked by every bandit in the vicinity. 

\- Keep some cash to pay your troops when traveling from city to city.",12,1585648252,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fsa573/trading_how_to_make_easy_money_in_the_early_game/,mountandblade,1

If I can upgrade my PC at some point in the future I'll probably repurchase it but I don't know when that would be, especially in these difficult times. I've tried running it on Geforce now but my internet connection isn't great so I'm not sure if that would be the best way to play it.

fs9yyw,WhatPrice94,Genuine Disappointment,"Let me preface the following with some background. I'd consider myself a big Mount and Blade fan and have been playing the series ever since pirating the original Mount and Blade back in the day. I immediately fell in love with the sandbox gameplay and player controlled character medieval warfare I had always longed for, especially when controlling armies in series in like Rome Total War.

After nearly 8 years in development I won't be putting on my rose tinted glasses and fall in line like most people in this sub. There is absolutely no excuse for the bugs that currently exist in  the game as is. From views inside characters heads, to crashes, to missing glitchy textures, to not being able to win the board game, to broken quests. All of these indicate a rushed cash grab based on the previous titles name alone. I work in software development as a QC manager and to even release an alpha with such obvious and seemingly simple to fix bugs would lead me to worry for my job.  


And let's not even get started with the unbalanced quests and outcomes, weird NPCs with not even the audio dialogue from the last game, weirdly changed combat mechanics, missing dialogue options (why???), unfinished or else blatant lazy reuse of The Guild II ost?? and I can go on...........

I hope that Taleworlds can remedy the situation as this is what Early Access allows for, however after 7 years I am one disappointed customer. I have my hunches as to why the game released like this and without going into detail I can only guess that it has something to do with easy government money based on the first game.

fs9tvz,AranweabLe,Quick and Honest Review from Hardcore MB Fan,"i know the game still in early access but hear me out

&amp;#x200B;

\- no voice acting really destroys the immersion and realism. towns, villages, taverns, npcs they all feel so dull and boring because of it. also wish my soldiers could talk with each other in battle like total war ,scream at enemy, taunt the enemy etc. is it really hard to add voice acting in 2020 dear TW? even skyrim modders are doing it now. this is my biggest complain about this game.

&amp;#x200B;

\- npc and companion dialogues are broken. one minute i threaten this villager and the next i talk to him he acts like nothing happened between us just a minutes ago. also i met this companion in tavern i just pressed F and she immediatly started talking about his life story i didn't asked your life story wth? dialogue options are so limited.

&amp;#x200B;

\- musics are nice, i really like it. but, i hope i won't get bored when i visit the same tavern again tho i'm not sure i'll ever visit the same tavern i visited again cuz they'all look so boring and dull except that bard dude he rocks.

&amp;#x200B;

\- graphics.. now listen. we can't except RDR 2 level graphics in a game big like this but sometimes the graphics looks like these free battle royale games on steam. i think the overeall art and map design is really bad so it makes the game look so amateurish.

&amp;#x200B;

\- optimization well my r9 290 &amp; fx 8350 runs the game on ultra just fine. tho i lower  the few settings to medium when there's big battles like shadows.

&amp;#x200B;

\- npc faces well i'll be honest this game at the moment makes mass effect andromeda npcs look good. i think even warband had better faces? or they looked more ''real'' ?

&amp;#x200B;

\- combat is good. nothing special but it's just works. it's fun.

&amp;#x200B;

\- bugs lot of bugs... like the entire town has gathers and t-poses in same place like bugs. but we were warned that's why it's still early access.

&amp;#x200B;

overall i like the game and i'll keep playing it but there's still long way to go. i wish TW waited a few more years before releasing the game at this current state but well maybe this is better and will help the game progress much faster with the help of community. if you are not a mb fan or never played mb game before stay away from the game for now. or just get the game for multiplayer. multiplayer side is really good.. i think multiplayer mode alone is worth purchasing this game. anyway i talked lot but these are my thoughts.

fs93lz,Kaelosian,Give me your tips and tricks!,"Here are mine:

Push N to open the encyclopedia.

Winning tournaments is a great way to get gear.

Breaking down weapons trivializes the economy. This is borderline an exploit.

A shield welding heavily armored opponent can be easily killed with left chops aimed up at their head. If you're doing low damage in tournaments you need to aim for the head.

Circling clockwise and left chopping is a cheesy way to win every tournament.

Talking to townsfolk in towns/taverns or caravans in the world is an easy way to get tips on good trade routes.

The encyclopedia lists all companions, their skills, and dispositions.

The encyclopedia lists the last known location of characters from factions, similar to asking someone's location in warband.

Throwing weapons still kinda suck.

You get to wear your armor into tournaments.

Manually navigating around and sticking to the roads is faster than clicking on your destination and just letting autopilot take you, the pathfinding will not avoid forests and will take suboptimal paths around rivers.

Couch your Lance or spear by getting up to a gallop and pushing X.

You can expand your status bar on the bottom of the map screen to see your speed

**Some things I haven't figured out yet**

Can you equip companions or level them up manually?

Is there a way to accompany another party?

fs8w9o,Bore_of_Whabylon,Early Access and the Community,"I'm seeing kind of a weird reaction from the community about the release. A lot of people seem to not be recognizing that it's early access, and judging the game as if it's a full release.

I think it's entirely reasonable to criticize bugs, features that aren't working out, and flaws in the game design. That's the purpose of Early Access. You get access to the game before its full release, and the goal is that you can submit things you don't like about it to the devs. Now, personally I think they should have optimized it a bit more before they went through with the release. But I'm seeing people complain about the relative lack of content in comparison to Warband. That doesn't make sense to me. It says in big, bold letters that the game isn't done, so don't expect it to be!

Now, that being said, I'm also seeing an equally unhelpful reaction from people who I assume are riding a hype high. I've seen people submit valid criticism, only for a deluge of fanboys to rush in and defend everything about the game (""10/10 game!!! You just aren't playing it enough"") That's not helpful to the devs either. Frankly, if Bannerlord went through its full release today, it'd probably be tossed aside by the end of the month. It's buggy as hell. It's unoptimized. It still has a lot of missing content and features. Our goal is to report stuff like that to the devs so the game can actually be great. Just saying that it's perfect as is doesn't help anything.

I'm just worried that people aren't gonna use this period for its intended purpose.

fs8em6,LuukeyBoy,Pro Gamer Tip. Sending your troops into battle without you gives them WAY more XP,"I have tested it multiple times when fighting bandits. 

It seems that every time I fight a battle against them lets say in a 40 v 20, or 20 v 10 ,etc. Maybe like 4-6 troops get enough experience to level up (tier 1-3) 

Now whenever I send in my troops in without me, in same circumstances, Im doubling the amount of troops im able to promote to higher tiers. 

I believe this has to do with the fact that it might be evenly distributing experience among all troop types as if every single enemy was killed. Because when you engage them personally and you win, half of them run away without your troops getting to kill them and get that valuable experience. 

So if you want to level up troops faster, send them into battle without you.

Also dont use this method if its a legit battle because you usually lose when you do that and you miss out on actually enjoying the battle.",5,1585638859,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs8em6/pro_gamer_tip_sending_your_troops_into_battle/,mountandblade,1

I can't progress because I can't challenge bandits, I can't pick up new quests, I can't even talk to random people in the tavern. It softlocks my game whenever I open dialogue.  


I have tried contacting support on multiple channels. They aren't listening/don't care. I don't know why not. Normally video game companies think bug reports and feedback are valuable.   


The fact that a total of 5 hours of my life have been wasted by these glitches so far (3 hrs first campaign + 2 hrs second)  is what frustrates me. Furthermore, there is no way for me to talk to support or send a bug report, so as far as I know, these gamebreaking glitches will go on plagueing my save files and making it unplayable for the foreseeable future.

fs7rts,Milkhemet_Melekh,Need some advice,"So, while I can actually play the game, I need some help getting the most out of the experience. At the moment, I'm running into a fair amount of frustration.

1) How do I make it run smoothly? I've turned down the audio to its lowest setting, I've turned on V-sync to full, I've capped frames at 30, and settings are hovering medium-low. At this point, even the lowest possible settings are apparently too much data for my old-ass computer, but maybe there's something I'm missing in all of this?

1.5) If there's anyone here who is good at computer stuff and hardware, lmk because I've been considering a new graphics card for quite some time, and I want to know if the PC specs are even decent anymore. It was an absolute monster back in the day, but maybe not anymore.

2) I'm having a really hard time with blocking. Directionality being linked to either look-direction or movement is particularly frustrating and makes me long for the days of auto-block where I was free to move around and aim my strikes without needing to panic-block in the wrong direction 9/10 times because it's happening so fast and I can't even stay focused on the enemy and where his attacks are coming from because I need to flick my screen somewhere else just to respond, much less have the time to re-aim and strike back.

Shields have been a big help, but I'm still getting thrashed. Directionality doesn't feel especially responsive with the mouse, which I had hoped would be at the very least my attack direction choice. Are there any tips some of you veterans of this system can give me to help me adjust to the change?

For the record, I'm not completely alien to directional combat, but my main experience here is KCD which I find to be much more responsive and easier to work with (on a controller, at any rate, where the two sticks control direction and movement, while the game has a lock-on option so I don't lose track of the enemy)

All legitimate advice welcome, I'll take what I can get. I don't even feel like there's a place to train blocking appropriately, and the occasional stutters don't help.",13,1585635586,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs7rts/need_some_advice/,mountandblade,1

fs7m1g,KingMoonfish,Anyone else getting frustrated with the early game (especially missions)?,"First of all, I love the game overall. However I'm really, really struggling here. Mainly the missions seem to really, really suck.


Family Feud: Let's take away all your soldiers as you're about to enter a dangerous situation. WHY?! Why would I ""guard"" this guy, walking up to the people who want to kill him, without any of my soldiers? He dies within 2 seconds anyway. This mission is legit impossible to fight through.


Looter encampments: Let's take away your mount for a very difficult combat. What if my character is focused on riding? This is a big f bomb to lancers like my character. Also again, you can't use all of your troops because reasons. 


Random merchant buying thing: I accepted a quest to take some cows from one place to another, and lo, I'm apparently breaking the law by buying cows and now have a criminal rating (that I can't see anywhere) and tons of people hate me. Uh, ok. I just won't ever do that quest again I guess...


Defend settlement from raiders: Lol here's twice your party size in attackers, a tier or so above your troops. With no warning that the mission was going to be that hard (and the town had a militia of 40+ that didn't want to help stop their town being pillaged, apparently...)


Like, I get it. It's supposed to be hard. But I feel like I'm slamming my head against a brick wall here, mate. I played hundreds of hours of Warband and I can't even make much headway here. I almost feel like the game is hitting me over the head with a brick because I'm trying to do missions instead of *something* else I'm supposed to do to get stronger. 


Again I love the game, it's just really frustrating atm, probably because I don't know the optimal way to level early on. But the game sure ain't helpin'.",4,1585634785,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs7m1g/anyone_else_getting_frustrated_with_the_early/,mountandblade,1

fs7c3p,Hikurac,What can I do with lots of money?,"Some backstory for you. So far I took up a mercenary contract with Vlandia, raided Sturgian caravans for cash, and bought three caravans and two businesses. The caravans are decent. They bring in about 300-700 profit. The businesses are a different story. I bought a velvet and silversmith workshop. They provide a whopping -40 to +40 profit, while being seemingly random. Definitely not worth 15k for each.

Regardless, I'm making about lots of money now and I don't know what to spend it on. I can't pay taverns to give rep boosts in towns. I can't hire separate mercenary companies to bypass my troop limit. I don't see any option to bribe people for reputation, which sucks because recruitment is blocked by individual reputation (Glad reputation is useful now, but recruitment being tied to each individual? Makes it very tedious.). I can't buy ships afaik. I have all this money, but nothing I can seem to spend it on.",6,1585633428,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs7c3p/what_can_i_do_with_lots_of_money/,mountandblade,1

fs77l9,Assassin4nolan,Bannerlord Economy Megathread and FAQ,"The goal of this post is to act as a hub for information, and information gathering as to how the economy of Bannerlord, the trade prices, caravans, workshops, village productions, and fief outputs, works. I will try and edit info and answered questions into the OP as much as possible. Having a centralized source to understand game mechanics does wonders both for helping new players and old. Some of the below questions will have blank answer slots, that means I need help gathering info. Please feel free to answer or correct anything you read here. 


1.
Q: How do I build workshops, I haven't seen a menu option for it yet?

A: you have to go into a town center, press alt to find a tannery, brewery, or smithy, and talk to a shop worker their. Once youve talked to them, regardless of location, you can by the shop for 14K and instantly change it to any of the availble workshop types at no cost.


2. 
Q: Do workshops level my trade/steward skill?

A:


3.
Q: Can I operate a caravan myself, or does it have to be companion led?

A:


4. 
Q: Do caravans level up my trade skill or just the companion leading it?

A:


5:
Q: Are their any companions/archetypes with high trade skill? Where are they?

A:


6.
Q: My workshop isnt profiting/only marginally, can I control this.

A: Presumably workshops become more profitable the more bound (tied to city, shows when hovering over city) or close (?) villages produce the required input. A city with 2 or 3 bound/close grain villages would have cheap inputs for a brewery and thus hifher profit margins. It also appears that their rate of profit increases over time, so it might just take a few weeks to start making money.


7.
Q: How do I get the/more trade rumor tooltips for buying and selling prices?

A: It appears as if simply visiting more towns and scrolling through the trade menus adds more price comparisons to your trade rumor tooltips.


8.
Q: Why are some trade rumors greyed out/have less opacity?

A: My assumption is that theyre either faded based on age of the rumor or by city proxitmity.


9.
Q: Do I need to protect my caravan?

A: caravans always start with 30 members, so unless there is a war between the owner of the city your caravan is based in (your caravan is labeled as that faction, not yours) and where your caravan is going, or cavalry bandits start spawning in large number, you should be fine. 


10.
Q:i just started, how do I make money?


A: Become a mounted archer/charger and hunt looters, build your starting group with cav/stockpile sumpter horses to be able to catch up with looters, after getting 5K spend half on trade goods after finding an acceptable route/profit margin, repeat. Steppe, forest, and mountain bandits all have serious ranged potentialso be careful raiding hideouts.",226,1585632785,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs77l9/bannerlord_economy_megathread_and_faq/,mountandblade,1

1. Reduce sound channels in the audio settings to lowest.

If you are too far away then go to documents&gt;Bannerlord&gt;configs&gt;engine_config and look for Cheat_mode and switch it to 1. Then you can teleport on the map using ctrl + left click and go straight to the poachers.

fs61gg,Fastidieux,How to play the game? When does it get good? How to not be terrible?,"So i know you can run a business, (maybe make a trade empire?), become a king, take part in politics, manage a settlement/castle...afaik the game becomes like a grand strategy at some point.

But im just rolling around trying to trade by buying low and selling high, not making any profit because all the trade rumors are dogshit and dont encompass every item, or NPCs manipulate pricing by the time i get there...its basically gambling. I couldn't even make a spreadsheet or a list, just because other traders are influencing markets SO MUCH that any list i'd made would be obsolete by the time i get to the next town. ~4 hours of game time lost here with no profits and only a gain of 13 skill points after thousands and thousands of gold switched hands...AND I HAVE THE LEARNING RATE MAXED with focus points. Maxing the Trade skill alone is probably going to take millions....which is WAY more money than an entire faction has in gold AND assets/tradable goods, at least from what i've seen from my home faction's towns and cities.

Im going from town to town looking for quests and trying to 'talk to nobles' to get 'Neretzes' Folly' quest done. Bribe a guard to let me in for like 750+ gold only to find that there is no noble even around. Not only this but im going from town to town looking for quests...and when i did manage to find one i was sent to another town in the same faction and lost 30 rep fighting like 20 peasants only to gain 250 gold and 5 rep from the quest giver. Next quest i have to take iron to another city, finally something easy-ish....but when i try to leave the city some other trader notifies me of some stupid fucking law and i say something along the lines of ""this is a shakedown, im not giving you the iron""...and lose 15 rep from one trader to gain 5 rep and 350 gold from the quest.

Im trying to build up forces by recruiting in towns that may or may not have 1 shitty peasant which has a high likelyhood of dying in the next fight vs looters...i finally build up 15 shitty peasants and then just get run over by a party of 4 forest bandits.

Combat at this point is basically just me on horseback circling around peasants and looters on foot using the range of my spear and a bow to pick them off and separate them. Its literally the same fucking fights all day, i've been playing for like 10 hours...and all i have to show for it is a 1200g helmet from a tourney, some renown and VERY MINOR amounts of skill leveling, a bow i bought for 500g, and 3 mules.

An item called ""crossbow"" is 21k gold...i can only imagine how much a business even costs, let alone figure out how to even go about buying one or even raising rep with a trader to maybe get an option. AFAIK every notable, non-trader/companion NPC says literally nothing when i try to talk to them unless they have a blue !

I just want to get in a proper fight where i dont feel like i need to cheese the fuck out of the combat (though winning the tourney was fun). I want to own a castle and a business, experience a siege battle...but at this pace itll take 6 years and most of that time will just be me doing literally nothing as im taken as prisoner for 3-5minutes, or waiting to heal in a town/recruiting more dudes.

I fully understand that im blind, or terrible, or both...or maybe i set my expectations too high. I just can't get a foothold into the game after 10 hours of trying myself, i have no idea how to progress when the game is throwing so many maluses at me for even trying to do so (see quests above)...i literally cant even do a quest because im at negative rep with the dude with no remedy or recourse in sight.

I also didnt expect the game to be this glacially paced, losing everything is fine if you made some progress...but i really havent.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",41,1585627433,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs61gg/how_to_play_the_game_when_does_it_get_good_how_to/,mountandblade,1

fs5pdy,A_Humpier_Rogue,Two thoughts on Bannerlord,"Just wanted to get some constructive thoughts going, feel free to post yours below just to get some conversation going.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have one minor gripe which is that some things feel a bit ""Too"" streamlined/designed for QoL. The fact that when you complete quests you immediately get the reward and don't have to go back to the quest giver is not good IMO. It takes the immersion out IMO. Now for some quests, like Caravan quests I think this is a good idea, you can just say the caravaneers give you the reward promised so you don't have to backtrack across Calradia to get the reward. But for lots of other quests this really doesn't make sense or feel right IMO, you should have to go back to the quest giver for your reward.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, another minor gripe I have is that there is a bit of a lack of quest variety. Now, of course, I expect that this is purely because of Early Access, core content comes first and then TW can focus on side quests and the like, but I felt I had to bring it up. I feel like I have done the ""Army of Poachers"" quest like 50 times and except for the map being different it's the same every time.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, just as a side note, walk around the cities sometimes! They truly are beautiful, and a lot of work went into the cities and they feel so much better than the Warband cities.",10,1585626022,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs5pdy/two_thoughts_on_bannerlord/,mountandblade,1

fs5iw6,blindthrowaway1234,"I've got to say it, I don't like the new multiplayer gear loadout system.","In warband, you had a set amount of gold to start out with in multiplayer games, but you had so much control and customization options over your kit. Choosing every piece of armor and every weapon. 

Why'd they abandon such an awesome system for pre-made kits? It takes the fun out of the game. It creates situtations where you're forced to play with weapons you don't like, rather than being able to switch em out and experiment with the all of them, figuring out which ones you like the best.

Am I missing an option here or something? Because if it's just premade gear kits for multiplayer, i think this is going to be a single player only game for me. In present state the combat options feel real stale. 

I'm a huge fan of this Taleworld btw. I have over 2000 hours logged into Warband, Fire &amp; Sword, and the original. I loved those games, but this just feels like it's missing the mark, and I'm pretty disappointed at a lot of their mechanics and game design decisions. It's a medieval sandbox game, that's why it's so popular. You need to give players more choices, not hem them in and remove their choices. That's not fun. Please Taleworlds, you guys are better than this cookie cutter crap that every other medieval combat game has already beaten into the ground like the dead horse that it is.",1,1585625264,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs5iw6/ive_got_to_say_it_i_dont_like_the_new_multiplayer/,mountandblade,1

fs5iij,MercenaryJames,"First thing I noticed in Bannerlord, armor makes a big difference!","So for those of you who've been playing the beta pre-release, this may not be a shocker to you.

But one thing I noticed quite early on while doing Tournaments and generally fighting against stronger units, is how having good armor actually effects the combat!

Against normal enemies my Spatha cuts through Looters and other low tier enemies like butter, no resistance and they get staggered when hit. Same goes for me with my basic equipment.

But against heavily armored enemies, I noticed my sword would straight up get stuck/bounce off! Not only that, but (frustratingly) my swings wouldn't interrupt their attacks and they'd strike me though I landed my strike first.

As I started to get better equipment and properly cover myself in higher grade armor, I too started to share this characteristic! Swords sometimes just \*smack\* against me and don't interrupt my follow up. 

I think it's neat (and daunting) that armor actually plays into the combat vs just numbers and stats. It makes fighting an army of high level units all the more threatening, as unless I have the weaponry to get past their armor, I'm pretty much doomed. (That and the AI is so relentless you'll never get a hit in anyway).

Just wanted to share that, as I had never noticed this before.

fs5ice,cgfox1996,Unpopular Opinion: Bannerlord should not have come out yet,"Don’t get me wrong, I’m having a lot of fun (when I can). The overworld, village and cities, and battlefields are absolutely beautiful. Combat, albeit far more difficult than war and, is very rewarding. And exploring a Calradia that is even more deep, vibrant, and alive than Warband is something that I’ve looked forward to for years now, much like all of you. 

With all that said however, the game should not have come out yet. The balancing is atrocious (even for an EA). The game’s optimization can’t handle anything above high graphic settings at best and even then crashes randomly when settings are turned all the way down. Hell, there’s even dialogue options that literally sound like notes-to-self. It would be different if this had been a fairly new project, but it honestly just doesn’t seem this should be the product of nearly 8 years of work. 

The reason I argue that it should have been further delayed and polished is because I’m worried for Taleworlds and their reputation. Think about No Man’s Sky, for example. NMS had such a huge hype train when it was announced, people followed the dev blogs religiously, myself included. When it dropped, it was a disaster. Everyone on the hype train quickly jumped off for good reason, and even now with the game a much better and more fun improvement than when it first launched, it doesn’t nearly have the player base that it had accumulated back in development. 

I don’t want the same thing to happen to this community. I know TW will keep working on this game and make it into something great, but right now it is anything but. I’m going to of course stick around cause I mean I’ve waited this long right? But I just wanted to get that off my chest.

fs4uoj,BurgooButthead,Bannerlord Tips and Tricks from a guy who has played all day,"Ive been seeing a lot of the same posts lately asking for advice so here's what I have seen after almost 12 hours of playtime.

Money:
Quest rewards are really lucrative in this game so always try to take advantage of them. A quest is available if there is a blue exclamation mark on their profile. There are a couple of quests that are a quick and easy way to get money.

Overpriced goods: A quest found in towns which involves procuring a given amount of goods from other places to sell back to the merchant in town. The questgiver pays out waayyyyy more than any normal shop would. An easy way to do this is to simple look around for the nearest village that specializes in producing the good they need.

Another gang in town: A quest given by crime lords asking you to deal with another gang. The reason this is so lucrative because there is an option to betray the quest giver and receive DOUBLE the pay you normally would (about 1k if you betray). You will take a hit to relations but you will gain relations with the other person you decided to join.

Kidnapped/Killer quests: I grouped these 2 quests together because they both involve you tracking down someone on the world map. Although it might not give much, it's pretty consistent and hasn't bugged out on me.

Herding quests: Another straightforward quest, deliver animals to a nearby town. low risk medium reward, no bugs for me yet.

QUESTS TO AVOID: Family Feud (maybe I'm bad but it is very hard to win the fight and protect the killer). Poachers (Haven't done it but have seen a lot of people complaining about crashing after accepting this quest). Smuggling(not the fence one)?? this quest does make a lot of money but at the cost of criminal reputation. Found myself banned from an entire faction as a result.

Smithing. Smelting down weapons into their components and making iron will net you large amounts of profit. ALWAYS SMELT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS. With smithing perks that give bonus resources, I think it is possible to get infinite money. Kind of annoying to level though, smithing stamina will come in quickly after you try to spam.

Gear:
1. Kill sea raiders and mountain bandits. Sea raiders have always have good starting gear but are a bit hard to kill. Mountain bandits spawn with Highwaymen that drop good armor and horses too. However, both groups may be a challenge if your party is too weak.
2. Tournaments. Good way to earn both gold and gear. Some tourney rewards are really powerful. I got this metal helmet from one tournament that gave me 45 head armor. Absolutely insane for just the beginning of the game. 

Tourney tricks:
 
Pay attention to what units are on the roster, this way you can tell if the tournament will be easy or not and can bet appropriately. You don't necessarily always want the best unit on your team because you will end up facing him/her at the end.

If you are 1v1ing someone try to run and attack in circles around them. The AI seems to have trouble blocking you this way allowing you to sneak some hits in the side.

fs4l58,Manastone420,bannerlord save file editor?,"does anyone have one? my single player game is fucked, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I tried contacting support through various channels (except Facebook, I don't have one and I never will) and got no replies.  


Here's what happened:  
I accepted the 'Too many Poachers' quest from one Targai the Mercer.  
I left the town to go and deal with the poachers.

5 seconds out of the town, my game hangs/freezes/softlocks/crashes, whatever you like.

So I try reloading in safe mode. My autosave also has the quest, and I don't have any saves from before this quest.

It crashes.

I try waiting in town until the quest expires... 5 seconds into waiting, the game hangs/freezes/crashes.  
I try attacking the quest giver. I can't make a hostile action against this walled city, or whatever, so I just walk up and punch him. He's invulnerable. Hitting him doesn't do anything. Swording his face and his wife doesn't do anything. I can't make him hostile to me.  


Obviously, talking to him doesn't allow me to drop the quest. I can only say 'they will be dead soon' or 'i need more time.' The quest interface doesn't have an 'abandon' button, for God only knows what reason.   


SO anyway my game is completely fucked and I've tried absolutely everything, and I don't really want to play my 3 hours again to get back where I was. I'd rather use a save editor to either remove that quest from my file or get a new file back where I was.

I spent six hours on a save, the hotfix came out and now I cannot play my save. Even worse I went to start a new character and just move on, when I decided to save and test if even that would work-- It didn't. 

Resume Campaign crashes everytime. I verified integrity cache, I restarted my computer. I've done about everything I could do except reinstall the entire game which is something I dread doing.

Is anyone else having this problem? It killed my save and will not let me play any save. The game is ruined for me on day one until this gets fixed.

some dialogs may seem like you have options but no, you just need to click all of them if you need to convince some 1 and then it enforces you to act not how you want

started a fight an an NPC. and my fully healed fully geared companion just runs away or in circles and the other companion just disappeared

realistic combat? my main have 0 combat skills and i 2 punched a guy with armor and a shield

* Find your engine_config.txt file. Mine's located at C:\Users\lolsomedude77\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\Configs

* Find the line ""cheat_mode = 0"". Change it to ""cheat_mode = 1""

* Start a new campaign (doesn't work on existing saves).

*There is no known cheatmenu yet.* 

---

Confirmed cheats that I have tested myself include:

MAP CHEATS

* CTR + LMB (Teleport)
* Open inventory outside of a scene to view every object in the game (can be used for money/equipment cheat)

BATTLE CHEATS

* CTR + F4  (Inflict a single casualty)
* CTR + ALT + F4 (Knockout the whole enemy side)
* CTR + H (Heal yourself)

Other hideouts are loading just fine, but any time it's populated with sea raiders my game will hang and I have to force it to close. I've tried letting it load for over 20 minutes with no luck.

Possibly a bug, possibly just an issue on my end. Just wanted to bring some awareness to it and see if anyone else has had this problem.",6,1585618810,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs3wuq/possible_bug_with_sea_raider_hideouts/,mountandblade,1

fs3vu9,LodoVeld,Bannerlord Caravans explained,"Caravans do work. Most of this info has also been taken from other users’ experience. 

Invest 15,000 into the caravan and give it some time. The caravan departs with 0 stock so the first trips will consist of the caravan buying up stock. They try to sell this stock in profitable city and therefore it can take some time before they reach that city. Depending on your caravans starting location it’ll take a few days or maybe even a few weeks. Users with positive experience from a certain city should post it below.

If you want to escort your caravan just double click on it, you will follow the caravan.",8,1585618701,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs3vu9/bannerlord_caravans_explained/,mountandblade,1

fs3eaa,norman_rogerson,Let's Talk about Linux Support,"On second thought, let's not.  


Raw numbers don't lie, and as of today, the Steam hardware survey results show linux usage is only a meager 0.83% of responses. That is not a lot of reason to provide official support. Making the numbers look even worse is pretty easy, too; that 0.83% is broken into 3 major camps, all 0.10% or less. So it's a good thing this post isn't about supporting Linux.  


What I'd like to do, however, is to ask if we can move towards Proton support. Many of you are undoubtedly aware Proton is a compatibility layer for Linux based on WINE. I'd like to open this discussion for the community and the developers to come together in a way which benefits all parties to some degree. In and ideal world the developers spend a few hours making small tweaks which allows the game to run smooth and out of the box through Proton and Linux users can pay for and enjoy the next game in a series which has already brought so many hours of entertainment. The bad news is, as of writing this post there appear to be no reports on ProtonDB regarding the Early Access version of the game, only the Beta. This ultimately tells someone like me nothing as to how the game might play on my system.  


I know this is going to take effort, and here is where I need help. I want to know what the developers need from the community to make their jobs easier, should Proton support become more official. What logs do you need? Are there environments you want to see tested? I personally run Manjaro, an Arch derivative, and I would be incredibly excited to provide all the data you could want about how the game runs and what errors it encounters.  


I am not asking for Linux support; I am asking for an earnest effort toward Proton support.",2,1585616849,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs3eaa/lets_talk_about_linux_support/,mountandblade,1

Spare a thought for the guys that have had to figure out developing an amazing looking game in its final release hours while keeping themselves isolated and entirely online. 

They've had your support this long, you can afford to support them a little longer, now with the early version of the game you've been waiting for firmly in your grasp. Give them some more time, and this game will be even more incredible than it is now.

I’m honestly kind of excited to see in what ways modders will implement this system- assuming they don’t create their own special character creation system, of course.

Like, a fantasy mod where each Culture is a specific fantasy race. Or they could change Culture to Religion and allow you to choose that.

fs2tu0,BasDeLegend,Joining a siege not working as intended?,"First off I love this game 10/10. 

So I joined an ''ongoing siege'' as a mercenary. And basically nothing really happens, the defenders lose no troops and the attackers just get wiped out. I see the attackers building catapults and such but there is never actually a battle (where I can walk around with my character). Worst part is when 1 day passes al my food supplies get joinked and my party is starving. I had food for like 20 days aswell. It's late and I'm not good at english so I hope this post makes some sense.

TLDR: why can't I join an ongoing siege as a mercenary?

I’ve been looking at streams and videos of Bannerlord, and honestly, is there really that much new? The game, at its core is still quite similar to Warband and suffers a lot of the same problems. Sure there’s a new combat system and the overall engine of the game has been changed. However, the quests are still extremely linear and, dare I say, kinda boring. It’s like just attacking bandits over and over to grind. The NPCs are bland, cities seem empty just like in Warband. The siege system honestly just looks like a mini-game. 

Perhaps I’m making a poor decision by posting this on a sub that’s look forward to the game for so long (I have too), but honestly, while the skeleton of game certainly improved, the meat is seems similarly lacking to Warband.",17,1585613896,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs2ll3/is_this_actually_a_good_game/,mountandblade,1

I’m thinking mods on the scale of total overhaul like Gekokujo, A Clash of Kings, Pendor, etc.

fs2jec,PSPbr,"Is there more to this game's campaign later on? Playing it feels like playing Warband all over again. Please, sell me on it.","I bought the game, played it for two hours, but in this time it feels a bit too much like Warband to my liking. Don't get me wrong, i loved warband, played hundreds of hours and did multiple playthroughs of it, but i was expecting something more out of Bannerlord. 

The battles are exactly the same as Warband. I'm a fan of the Total War games and i was expecting formations and battlefield manouvers to be important now but most of the combat is still just a smash brawl of both lines like in Warband. There still seems to be no point to form shield walls, there is no way to counter cavalry with a line of lancers. Heavy cavalry still seems to be the only viable campaign strategy.

I'm also a fan of Kingdom Come and i love the hand to hand combat in that game. I didn't expect Bannerlord to be the same. But the bots keep going at you spamming their attacks like they have robot arms, there's no weight to it. The bot AI seems to be mostly the same too, they don't feel like individuals, they are no different from the ones in Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.

Am i wrong about any of this? Does the game broadens up later in the campaign? Because right now i'm really compeled to refund the game and actually play it with mods at a later date.

Title says it all, what troop combinations have been working for you so far? What troops seems OP?

Believe it or not vlandian crossbowmen, or any upgraded ranged units, seems to be OP asf on the field. I've been going solid on 60-70% crossbowmen that absolutely destroy anyone approaching. Rest of the party mostly cavalry with some footmen to distract the heavy cavalry. 

I've been steam~~rolling~~shooting some tree hugging 120+ battanian armies with my 70 troop size. Even the cavalry charging towards em are no match! Sometimes the crossbowmen begin to fire waaay too late though, seems to be some kind of bug? Anyone else having the same experience on ranged units?

Also, I wanted to go full on heavy polearm tank, but it seems a two handed axe is absolutely crushing the skulls of anyone unfortunate enough to be in the way. Splits em up nice enough to drink out of their skulls after

fs1oy6,eaparlati,Bannerlords One Handed,"So, I want to buy this game, but I have to come at this from a different direction. When I was younger, I had a stroke that limits my ability to use my right hand. Because of this, I play almost all games one handed. I have a mouse (Logitech G700s) that lets me adapt, but there are still games that I struggle to make work for me. Looking at you, Kingdom Come: Deliverance.

My mouse allows me to have three buttons on top (aside from the traditional mouse buttons) that I set up as Forward, Jump, and Back. I strafe with the side buttons on the mouse wheel. Then I have four programmable buttons on the side. Good enough for Skyrim or World of Warcraft. 

My question is: will this game too much for me?  I don't want to buy a game that I just can't handle, regardless of how amazing it is.  Is this more Skyrim, or more like Kingdom Come?",3,1585610593,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs1oy6/bannerlords_one_handed/,mountandblade,1

A notable Arab ambassador Ibn Fadhlan, in ca 10th century went to Volga Bulgaria and wrote a book of his travels. When I saw those tents in castle walls, this came to my mind:

""Coming from the bathhouse, on returning to the
house I looked at my beard. It was a block of ice, which I had to thaw in front of the fire. I slept in a house, inside which was another, inside which
was a Turkish felt tent. I was wrapped in clothes and furs, but in spite of that my cheek froze to the pillow. I saw cisterns in that country lagged
with sheepskins, so that they would not crack or burst, but it did no good. In truth, I saw the earth split and great crevasses form from the intense
cold. I saw a great tree split in two from the same cause.""

On the weapon card it says it has a swing damage of 14 and a pierce damage of 37,  
but when I swing with the weapon on horseback i get like 200+ dmg, even at low speed, while the thrust only does about 70+ damage at low speed.  
I guess this is not meant to be working like this since i am one hitting everyone now.

Just wanted to report this since this is probably some early access hickup.",0,1585609125,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fs1apn/fine_steel_menavlion_damage_bugged_overpowered/,mountandblade,1

I wanted to see if anyone else is having these issues, or if there's anything I can do about them. I got Bannerlord last night, it's fully updated as of this morning with the hotfix. When I opened it, I noticed even in the main menu I was having significant intermittent framerate drops to &lt;5fps and intermittent complete freezing. My PC is no beast, it's about a year old and has specs as follows: Windows 10, NVIDIA GTX 1060 3GB, intel i5 7400 3ghz, 8gb RAM. Still, I can't help but feel like something is wrong with optimization or settings when I can run other(fairly demanding games) on medium-high settings without any issues, especially given the framerate drops during menus which shouldn't really be too demanding. 

I already attempted turning down the quality(didn't seem to make much difference) and turned on Vsync since apparently that has been an issue for some people. Neither really made any difference.

frzyr4,Less_Tennis5174524,Requiring you to buy a horse for every troop you want to upgrade to cavalry os a serious 'nerf' to Khuzait (Khergits),"So like many people here I just bought Bannerlord and of course joined my favourite faction. Mine was the Khergits in Warband, I loved being able to quickly get a good horde going by just recruiting some peasants, fighting a few bandits and then be able to upgrade them to cavalry as the first step and almost no money. So of course I decided to play as the Khuzait in Bannerlord. I recruited a ton of peasants, fought some bandits, went to upgrade my men to cav and I couldn't. I needed to buy a horse. Okay, sp I went to the nearest town to buy one. 100 ducats each. Ouch. These are probably the most expensive troops to get to lvl 2. In Warband the Khergits were strong because you could turn out horsemen fast and cheaply, which made sense. Now the horse faction is probably the most expensive faction to start with, which doesn't make any sense. It would be okay if horses were cheap but they cost around 100-150. And even if you have the cash you need to find a place that has enough horses for sale. A town has around 0-8 from what I've seen. That just isn't enough. Right now I have a party of 50, most of them recruits who are waiting to be upgraded but can't because I lack the capital.

I hope this is changed. If not officially then at least in a patch. Its really messing up the fun in being a steppe nomad. I can't siege for shit and my army doesn't scale as well as any other. My only advantage has now been turned into a disadvantage.

However... I've played about 6 or so hours of the game and kid you not have had about 10-20 crashes in that time. The FPS is fine, it just randomly crashes to the desktop. What's worse is the report box that pops up gives an error whenever I attempt to send the data regarding the crash. In particular shortly after picking up quests it tends to cause a crash which will continue to crash over and over again every time I reload the autosave after a few seconds of moving on the map, forcing me to use an older save and being unable to do that quest.

Naturally, this has completely ruined my enjoyment of the game. I get that it is early access but it is completely unplayable for me in it's current state.

frzj23,KimJontheILLest,Poor mission design,"I noticed that some of the missions could, in my humble opinion, use some improvement. 

1. For ""Attack the bandit camp"" missions, you're only allowed to bring a handful of troops (five, in this case), who in my encounter were outnumbered 3 to 1. The worst part is that you apparently have no control over which troops you can bring ( I had 40 to choose from) and it defaults to your weakest troops (imperial recruits/peasants). Shifting your troops around in the party screen has no effect. A simple fix would for the game to use whatever troops you put at the top of your party screen. 
2. For ""Family Feud"" missions, unless I'm misunderstanding how the quest works, it seems like the developers want you to find a hidden character in the village. This is like finding a needle in a haystack. Villagers can't direct you to the hidden character, only the headsmen. IDK if locating the hidden character is tied to your scouting skill, in which case the mission may just be beyond my level, but there's no indication of that and I've ridden around villages multiple times looking for the feud target, only to give up after a while of not finding him.",8,1585603273,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frzj23/poor_mission_design/,mountandblade,1

frzd7r,Jasperstorm,Three little nit picks,"After playing this game for 4 hours now I have to say it has been a blast, however I do have things I would like to bring up.  


First is when I talked to a lord and introduced myself, I legit got this. ""Inset default acknowledgment of a famous character. We hope to add more in future updates."" I am paraphrasing a bit but that is what he said, I personally would prefer having them say the same thing over and over then to get a message like that. With that said obviously it is a small nitpick.  


Second, arenas. I was not a fan of how in War Band when you entered the arena you got random weapons. Would it be to hard to just be given wooden version of the weapons you have equipped? My warrior who knows how to use two handed weapons feels kind of handy capped when I start with a one handed ax and no shield. Heck mods have been allowing us to use what weapons we have equipped before, I feel like this should be tweaked.  


Third and final, the most serious, I ran into a fairly serious glitch. I accepted a quest from a towns member to go deal with a bandit hideout. I ride off to destroy it, wait till night to attack it, and when I do I hit the loading screen..... and it does not load. I don't think its frozen because the icon in the bottom right keeps moving, it just refuses to load this hide out. I can handle decently long loading screens, I used to play skyrim with dozens and dozens of mods. But after 10 solid minutes (yes I timed it) I decided it was a bug. I don't believe it is because of my computer because when I load in to a previous save I am still able to enter other towns and cities now problem and walk around. Its just this hideout. Thank God this didn't happen with the tutorial hideout or I would be pissed.  


Hope the developers can get to these problems but obviously considering how the world is right now, I think its ok if they take their time",5,1585602721,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frzd7r/three_little_nit_picks/,mountandblade,1

fry4fk,Shiny_Quartz,"Bannerlord, is it different?","I someone that played both mount and blades when they come respectively years ago. However, I never really understood the game. I always ended up doing the same thing. 

Finish tutorial, recruiting maximum ammount of men and just start raising villages to get easy levels and things to sell, then I got bored and started on attacking caravans for more money. Eventually I'd reach level 40 or something and by that time I started creating my own kingdom for a while until that got boring. And then I leave the game.

I don't care about NPCs or quests, everyone's personality is super shallow. No real history or lore to uncover, dialogue is pretty much just whitte noise to me. And all the other activities don't make sense to me. Trounaments, ladies, taverns, etc are just super boring.  
I like Roleplaying in games like Skyrim, Baldurs Gate, Dvinity, etc. But first I must care enough about the world, it's cultures and peoples, and honestly I couldn't give less of a \*\*\*\*\* about any of it.  


Combat was clunky as hell from what I remember and the only fun I had was running around on a horse swinging an axe at someone's face. Can't talk about multiplayer because I don't play multiplayer games.

But now Bannerlord is out on EA, and everyone is raging about Mount and Blade again, and I have seen footage of the game. It looks nice which I'm happy with, since the other two games were very ugly. But the combat just feels the same?

Is there an actual story now? Character's are well written and hopefully voiced? Is in general, existing in this game far more interesting? 

Or is it just Mount and Blade but with good visuals? I accept that these types of games might not be for me, I'm jsut not the target audience here, but everyone is just talking about it so I just wanted to know if it's worth the money for someone like me.",5,1585598692,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fry4fk/bannerlord_is_it_different/,mountandblade,1

fry2v7,Asaoirc,Lance How-To,"For those of you joining me in confusion on how to use lances, there are a couple requirements -

First, the weapon has to have the 'couched lance' trait on it when you hover over it. the starting spear (for some backgrounds) doesn't have that trait.

Secondly, it seems you need to be two-handing the lance (or maybe you can't couch with certain shields?

If you've done this correctly, when your horse is at speed, an icon of a horse with a lance at an angle will appear above your health bar. if you press 'X' while this is displayed, the lance will go horizontal on both the icon and in your character's hand, and you can deliver couched damage now.

frxpvc,Flaksim,Unplayable.,"I run the following specs:

* Game installed on NVME 970 evo samsung SSD.
* I5 9600K CPU
* 32 GB DDR4 RAM at 3000Mhz
* GTX 1080 most recent driver package (tried one older set of drivers too)
* Windows 10 home edition

The launcher has no text and looks weird, but the menu button is pressable. The main menu looks like this however:  [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/692555962665533490/694243333857345576/unknown.png?width=1204&amp;height=677](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/692555962665533490/694243333857345576/unknown.png?width=1204&amp;height=677)   


Going blind and pressing the second menu option also crashes the game. I tried uploading a crash report to Taleworlds, but that also failed (apparently their servers are not accepting crash reports or support tickets.)

frx6bi,RavenRains,Refunded.,"Worst Video Game experience i have ever had in my entire life!

when i heard the game was in development for years i thought it was coming out fully but then new spread it was going to be an Early Access but i was optimistic because they stated it was in development for years therefore it would be in a playable state with not many missing features,

&amp;#x200B;

But no it has a shitty ass graphic yet runs like crap on my beast of a PC, if i7 8700k and Gtx 1070ti 16gb ram is not enough for this game then nothing is... constant drops in frame and stutters i had to lower the setting but the lag and stutter never goes away! every other game runs smooth as hell on my PC!

&amp;#x200B;

not to mention the clunky combat is even worse!

the game doesn't even have pretty much most of its features developed yet, this game was never ready to be releaed into early access, see you guys in 10 years when they come out of Early Access (that if they do) and enjoy the broken game, i'm gonna spend that money on something that's finished and playable.

I cant cancle the quest because the questgiver just has 2 options which both lead to the same thing which is ""Okay I'll stay arround then"".

frw81k,CDCerda,Spy Party Quest Problems,"So, this quest type seems... odd. For those of you who haven't gotten this yet basically a lord in a city with a tournament can give you a quest to figure out which of the contenders of the tournaments is a spy by going around and asking the townfolk.

&amp;#x200B;

While the intel gathering is... boring and tedious to say the least you it's fairly fast if you just spam the question to everyone you come across. The man problem really comes with the part where you're meant to confront the contender, it's damn near impossible to find these guys. You're supposed to be able to find them near the alleys where thugs hang out, but I've literally only ever found one of these guys and I happened to challenge him to a duel without having all the intel so it flagged it as killing an innocent contender and failed the mission.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I've collected all the intel and, well, I've spent nearly an hour wondering around every damn nook and cranny in Baltakhand trying to find another of these bastards. I've left and reentered the city several times, walked through every area, and even tried talking to thugs to see if they had any info, but doing so causes the game to crash when I have all the intel, but not before.  


So, I'd suggest adding some sort of map marker to at least give the player an idea of what part of the city the contender is actually in. I'm really enjoying the game, but trying to do this mission is driving me up a wall.

1: Do you need a mouse wheel to play this game? As someone who uses a mouse that doesn't include a scroll wheel is it possible to play without one?

I remember in M&amp;B Warband it was but i'm still curious.

2. How's the performance for everyone? Anyone noticing major optimization issues? 

3. Is it worth purchasing in it's current state? I'm aware the question will get biased answers considering how long people have been waiting and being on this subreddit but i'd like feedback on what people think of the game in it's current iteration.

4. How's Character customization? I remember in Warband you could do a lot with how you wanted to build your character, be it with traits, skillpoints, character gender, etc.",0,1585591432,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frvrw6/questions_regarding_the_game/,mountandblade,1

So my question is how is multiplayer compared to the beta? Siege was a fun game mode with my brief play time on it.

frvc8d,_AirMike_,They broke the bank,"The game costs 50$, but in CIS it costs 30$. If we take the average, the game costs 40$ for each copy.

There is a 10% sale on the game, while the owners of previous games get additional 10%. The average between 10 and 20 is 15%.

100%-15% is 85%.

85% of 40$ is 34$ (Per copy right now).

We also take into account that they only receive  70% due to steam stealing the profit.

70% of 34$ is 23.8$

Now, the player count is at its peak, there are currently 170,000 people playing the game (we don’t count those that haven’t launched it yet).

170,000 * 23.8$ = 4,000,000$

So in only ~8 hours, TW made 4 mil.

What am I supposed to be doing!

I see factions and large armies running around and I don’t want to be hunted by them. 
What would you tell a new person to do? 
When I’m in a battle I have an option to send troops to charge etc. How do I access the other list of things left of charge?

fru3ec,Golvellius,Bannerlord first impressions,"I'm opening this one for the lucky few ^^ who managed to buy it and start it. But also for those still on the fence who want to see a few impressions.  How are you liking this long-awaited game?  


I'll start with saying, I was generally pleasantly surprised with how the combat is very similar to Warband, I was a bit concerned it would feel different and just wouldn't be the same.  

I have a couple of gripes so far though, I'm not sure how much of it is because it's EA and how much is just needing a few time to adjust.  

The first thing is the feedback from the melee strikes, it's like it's not there, at least when the strike connects (it's ok when it gets blocked). I'm not sure if it's something more related to the animations, the ragdoll or something else, but I feel something is missing.  

Another thing is the horse vs infantry fights, I think there is some adjustment to be made in the way you charge your strikes from horse vs infantry, a lot of times I just swing at horse-level which is something that never happened in Warband. It feels like you have to really be orienting way way down to hit soldiers on foot.  


Other than this, the graphics is a great and welcome improvement. I'm not really fond of the scenery though (the grass, trees, skies etc), I hope it gets an upgrade later down the road because to be honest it was a bit of a letdown, compared to the characters and items that generally look good.",3,1585586129,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fru3ec/bannerlord_first_impressions/,mountandblade,1

Even worse, I ended up paying significantly more than I would've had to on Steam (discounts included) because of currency differences between my Steam store and where I currently am... just wanted to give them more profits ffs.

Anyway, wrote an email to TaleWorlds a good 5 hours ago and still no reply - trying support form from their website doesn't even submit after several tries either.

frtmv1,tchoob,DO NOT ENABLE CHEATS - You will have to start a new campaign!,"If you're anything like me, after discovering how difficult this game is I immediately googled how to enable the cheat menu, which results in a few websites telling you to go into documents, find your engine ini, and change 'cheat_mode = 0' to 'cheat_mode = 1'. Then you have to go into the game and hit Ctrl + ~, and type 'cheatmenu no' .

You can find that entry in documents and you can change it and save it, and it will enable cheats in your game. But there is no in game console. Rather, a couple of the healing cheats work, but you can't cheat your skills, or your money. What you CAN do is go into your inventory and notice that every item in the game is now sitting by your feet on the ground.

This fucking breaks the game.

It doesn't matter what you do at this point, you can't actually grab any of the items. If you try to the game will crash when you exit the inventory. Actually, even if you don't grab any items the game will crash. Oh fuck, now we can't use the inventory at all without the game crashing.

So, you go back into documents and disable the cheat menu. Your last auto save is from before the cheats were ever enabled so it should be okay, right? Wrong. Your inventory is now permanently corrupted. Even though you've disabled cheats, even though you loaded to a save before they were ever enabled, every time that you try to leave your inventory screen the game will crash.

Obviously, you need to use this screen. So I'm starting a new campaign. 4 hours gone.

Don't be like me. Just turn the difficulty down.",3,1585584660,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frtmv1/do_not_enable_cheats_you_will_have_to_start_a_new/,mountandblade,1

Whenever I look at the folders, I sometimes remember the number sequence (which is the game's Steam store ID). For instance:

- Resident Evil 2 (Remake) = 883710
- Man of Medan = 939850
- Panzer Corps 2 = 1072040
- Destiny 2 = 1085660

frsyt5,ItsWackMan,Short notes about Bannerlord after having played it for 3h,"Hey, PC specs i7-9750H, 2070RTX, playing on medium/very high settings (tuned some down)

Here are my notes about bannerlord after playing for 3h:

1) Graphics and overall UI in campaign map is amazing in my opinion, everything looks and feels so smooth.

2) The tutorial (which ends after taking down the first bandit camp) is easy to follow and teaches basics, something that you realise later is that you are REALLY SUPER weak at the beginning. You basically suck at melee combat.

3) Love the character creation - imagine what could be made with mods.

4) Performance - A few stutters here and there, had a weird crash - after losing the tutorial fight i re-entered the cave and crashed. Has not happened since and i think it's something tutorial-related. Stable fps all around. Stutters do not appear after running the game for 15 min.

5) Campaign marks: 

Love that there are so many small-sized parties moving around, they are needed to level up your pathetically weak player. Have died many times to looters/bandits throwing rocks at me and it is fun and harsh.

Battannia bandits are cancerous early game, they carry javelins which 1 shot you if unlucky!

Campaign seems way better than I thought it would be and I can only imagine what will become of it.

The skill system is really cool and user-friendly, although it could use a bit of help with explaining at the beginning!

I have still not found a city that sells normal armor, every one has high tier helmets, but no body armor. Maybe it's something found harder now?

In conclusion, to me, it seems like TW delivered way more than I could expect from an early release, especially after some of their comments which made me worried - but for no reason. I'm back to playing now.

To everyone who has performance issues/crashes: I hope they get fixed soon, sad to see so many posts like that, maybe driver issues?",5,1585582495,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frsyt5/short_notes_about_bannerlord_after_having_played/,mountandblade,0
frsyju,Duke_Victor,Initial Impressions. Just finished a 5 hour gaming session. Very very long and honest post.,"Due to my time zone it’s getting pretty late. I’m going to bed and would like to post my initial impressions.

First off this early access release exceeded my expectations. There are bugs and problems but nothing too bad. The game feels great, plays well, and looks very good. 

Optimization is pretty amazing I have an i7-4790k and an rx580 gpu with 24gb of ram. Kind of a mid tier gaming pc. I tested settings and battle sizes in the custom battle mode and was able to play 600 man battles at 60-80 fps on mostly high settings. I was honestly expecting only being able to run 300-400 man battles with those specs. A very pleasant surprise.

The commander battle AI in the custom battle mode is actually very smart. They set up a circle of shield walls when I flanked with Horse archers and had archers in the middle of the circle. Then they counter attacked with cavalry. The AI in custom battle was actually using strategy and formations.

Now Campaign mode:

The character creation and background was super enjoyable and very well done. Picking who my father was, my culture, my childhood was very well done and compelling. Very fleshed out character backgrounds and great for an RPG minded player like myself.

I created a Vlandian whose father was a baron retainer and i did some service in the cavalry of my lord. I picked my other choices as I saw fit. Very engaging. My intention was to make a Vlandian Mercenary character, that fights on horse with sword and lance.

The tutorial felt like viking conquest and in the future I hope they add a pure sandbox mode. I understand that the tutorial is there for new players and players that need direction when given a sandbox. For us mb vets Id like a pure sandbox option in the future. Otherwise the tutorial was done well and not too long.

The perk and skill system seems nice. I like that the more you do something  you improve that skill, this doesn’t just apply to weapon proficiency, all skills appear to be like this now. Using focus points appear to increase your cap in a skill. Many of the perks seem very cool. Haven’t had enough time to properly judge this system honestly. But it appears promising.

I spent most of the of time ingame getting a small group of warriors together and fighting bandit parties. Leveling up, ransoming prisoners, and selling loot. Food seems very important now. Felt like my group of 20 guys were going through food like crazy. They were starving at one point, because I hadn’t bought enough. Logistics are way more important now and in my next battle half my starving troops ran away once we suffered a handful of casualties. Thankfully it was only a few looters we were fighting.

The morale system feels impactful. if you get on a roll killing bandits, they just disperse and bolt. 

Seeing the AI lords going around recruiting and buying supplies was awesome. Ran into the company of the golden boar fighting a bandit party and helped them. My clan renown was very low, so their commander didn’t take me seriously.

Clan renown is huge. Until you get to tier 1, you’re just joe blow fuckvilles family from nowhere. Once you get to tier 1 your party size gets bigger, you can be a mercenary company, lords treat you differently, and you recruit from your faction’s settlements more efficiently. Clan renown is the most important factor in progressing the world.

Recruiting is much better, and I like that I can choose the kind of troops I want to recruit and it’s not left as much to a dice roll. Companions seem cool. I recruited siga longknife because she’s got great combat stats and euplion, (spelt his name wrong)the robber he was a former bandit rogue. You assign your companions roles in your party. For example, I made, euplion the party scout to help with spotting.

The highlight was the last hour. Merc for Vlandian who is at war with sturgia. King Derthert is on campaign and in my game session had conquer 3 sturgian castles and had a kill/death ration 2:1. You can see this information in your faction menu once you join a faction. Bottom line, the king was not fucking around and was on the frontlines with an army of 600 men. 

I began marching from Pravend to the king in campaign in sturgia once I had a clan tier 1 and a mercenary contract with Vlandian. I had a good amount of money and bought supplies before departing on my march. On they way I figured I’d stop at towns and villages and do further recruitment. On my way their  I was attack by the Ercard of the brotherhood of the woods, because I was a mercenary in service to vlandia and he named me an enemy of the common folk. My company killed those outlaws like the scum they are. In a tense close battle we won by hiding behind some rocks for cover and charging his archers once they were very close. It was a super tense fight. And no I didn’t savescum. I got lucky honestly. I captured Ercard and could have killed the outlaw wantabe Robin Hood. But I needed coin badly and I’m a mercenary so i ransom him at the nearest town for 1000 gold. Stopped playing there and will continue tomorrow. Haven’t even made it to the king on campaign and I’ve had my own little story, and adventure. The narrative I just told was organically made from the sandbox. It was awesome.

Also weapon crafting is in the game. A very pleasant surprise.

Criticisms, complaints, and Bugs:
Can I make camp at all? Can anyone tell me how to make camp or is this a non-feature. If not Taleworlds allow us to make camp and give us some options please.

Economy seems good but there seems to be a few bugs especially with crossbows. No way should they be 22000 gold each.

If I attack a hideout that wasn’t in the tutorial, I get a load screen that runs for eternity 15 minutes and counting and I have to ALT-TAB-DEL to hard crash the game to play again.

Sandbox mode with no tutorial or quest line just like Viking conquest.

Does anyone know how to access the encyclopedia?

More quests and things to do for a clan at tier 0. The game didn’t really open up till I got to clan tier 1. I wasn’t able to really find any quests that were not associated with the tutorial at all. I understand I’m tier 0. But can’t I fetch things for people and go bounty hunting on my own accord at tier 0. Just to get some money and renown.

Also soon as possible add new scenes I encountered two settlements already that appeared identical. I understand that their are 300+ settlements. But new scenes would be much appreciated.

Combat AI is better but there are still some exploits. On horseback if your circling a group of bandits throwing javelins they have a tendency to throw the javs at the fucking sun and nowhere near me or my soldiers. 

That’s all I can remember for now. Going to bed. Really enjoyed the game. Plenty of room for improvement. Thanks to anyone reading this wall of text.",161,1585582471,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frsyju/initial_impressions_just_finished_a_5_hour_gaming/,mountandblade,1

frschd,KnLfey,How I bought M&amp;B2 directly on Steam for $29 USD (Without hurting the dev's profits),"This process simply amplifies your steam wallet currency via depositing items into your steam inventory. **This does not hurt the dev's bottom line in anyway shape or form.**

So I'm a particularly frugal these days, with mass unemployment and all. Thought I'd share how I did it in these trying times. I'm a bit of a TF2 trader so every time I buy a game on steam I do the following. 


 I calculate how many Team Fortress 2 keys I would need to sell via steam marketplace to buy the game. I check their current prices on there, then figure out how much money I get after steam taxes. For me, it was $3.13AUD per key. In this game a $56 game ÷ $3.13=17.89 ∴ You will need to sell 18 TF2 keys to do the same and you get extra change.

Why TF2 Keys? People on steam marketplace [pay way more for them](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) compared to this third party trading website. [marketplace.tf](https://marketplace.tf/items/tf2/5021;6) I buy the keys on market place at $1.67 USD (2.43AUD) then earn $3.13 AUD selling them. **That's an almost 25% extra buck for your buck**.

**But wait, there's more**. If you buy 11 keys from marketplace.tf *you get one free* when you use the code **Uncle** a sponsored promo code from [Youtuber Uncle Dane](https://youtu.be/DiG36d0NSH8?t=445) for those that are skeptical about this site.

So instead of paying $56 AUD for this game, I paid about $28.2 USD or $41.3 AUD (Saving about $15). Or if you're a first timer with that site, save even more with 10% off your first ever order with code *getawhale* 

You're welcome.

Also selling keys at market price might take longer depending if the price drops when you first advertise them. Make the process quicker by selling them 1 or 2 cents below the price they go for on your screen to get the money in just a few minutes.",3,1585580462,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frschd/how_i_bought_mb2_directly_on_steam_for_29_usd/,mountandblade,2

frrvhs,Simba7,BannerlordLauncher has stopped working (Crash on launch),"Hi all,

So I had this same problem during the beta (which I couldn't play) but had my fingers crossed it would be resolved.

When I launch via steam, nothing opens and an error message pops up (BannerlordLauncher has stopped working). Bannerlord.exe is similar, but references BannerlordStarter.

When I try to launch directly (via bannerlord.Native.exe) and attempt to bypass the launcher it loads for about 5 seconds and crashes to desktop with no error generated.

Thank you in advance!

frrs58,PrimaryCone056,Do you feel Bannerlord is a proper step up from Warband?,"As someone who played Warband a lot and also dived into With Fire and Sword and Viking Conquest (mostly like the latter) and waited a long time for the day to come I’m unfortunately a bit hesitant now as from watching some footage and streams it looks like Warband with a graphics overhaul.

So, instead of making a rash decisions I’d like to ask what the community feels. Do you feel it’s a proper step up and not “just” a graphics mod?

Is the battle AI improved or does it just follow the formula from Warband? I’ve heard sieges have got a lot of love (deservedly as they were always rough around the edges to say the least) but I have yet to see much of regular field battles?

Since combat is a big deal I’d like to know if bandits are as braindead as in Warband (didn’t like that all you did was ride around them unless they were Sea Raiders or maybe Mountains Bandits due to being stronger or having better range respectively) and if lords do more than just wait for your army to approach.

Second part is the quests as they seem to follow the same pattern of just traveling between towns to talk to lords, kill bandits or escort someone and so on. Are they a bit more detailed with more diversity and things you need to do to break the established pattern?

Bit of a long post but I’d be grateful if someone chipped in wether with just your opinion in general or answered my questions. Cheers!

tldr: Bannerlord better than Warband? Better battle AI for looters and lords? More detailed and diverse quests? Much thanks.",20,1585578528,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frrs58/do_you_feel_bannerlord_is_a_proper_step_up_from/,mountandblade,1

frrq3j,KnLfey,How I bought M&amp;B2 directly on steam for $29 USD,"I'm frugal and proud, thought I'd share how I did it in these trying times. So I'm a bit of a TF2 trader so every time I buy a game on steam I do the following. 


 I calculate how many Team Fortress 2 keys I would need to sell via steam marketplace to buy the game. I check their current prices on there, then figure out how much money I get after steam taxes. For me, it was $3.13AUD per key. $56 game ÷ $3.13=17.89 ∴ You will need to sell 13 TF2 keys to do the same.

Why TF2 Keys? People on steam marketplace [pay way more for them](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/440/Mann%20Co.%20Supply%20Crate%20Key) compared to this third party trading website. [marketplace.tf](https://marketplace.tf/items/tf2/5021;6) I buy the keys on market place at $1.67 USD (2.43AUD) then earn $3.13 AUD selling them. **That's an almost 25% extra buck for your buck**.

**But wait, there's more**. If you buy 11 keys from marketplace.tf *you get one free* when you use the code **Uncle** a sponsored promo code from [Youtuber Uncle Dane](https://youtu.be/DiG36d0NSH8?t=445) for those that are skeptical about this site.

So instead of paying $56 AUD for this game, I paid about $28.2 USD or $41.2 AUD (Saving about $15). Or if you're a first timer with that site, save even more with 10% off your first ever order with code *getawhale*

frr7u7,Kangawallafoxx,Well I'm an idiot.,"Thought I'd share how I literally made every wrong move with Bannerlord.

So for a bit of context, my main Steam account is technically the second account I made that became my main after a VAC ban on the first account. I also own Warband on my first account and use the family share feature to play it on my main.   


Anyway, in order to make use of the generous 20% discount Taleworlds provided for those who own a M&amp;B title, I switch to my first account and purchase it for myself and figure I can just use the family share to play it on my main. Sweet, no worries. I download and install all 31GB and hindsight hits me, ""Wait, I could have purchased it and gifted to my main, so then it would show my hours played/achievements etc on the right account"". Shit. No dramas, I have a fantastic idea! I'll request a refund, get my money back, buy the game again and gift it to my main. I'll be playing in no time!

&amp;#x200B;

Except I forget that Steam takes a little while to process the request AND actually refund the money. Now this wouldn't have been that much of an issue if I have refunded it to my Paypal, I could just buy it again and I'll get my original money back a bit later. But I didn't. I stupidly refunded it to my steam balance.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm sitting here with no Bannerlord, the game installed and $55.95 pending trying to decide whether I effectively buy the game again for a total of $110 and find another use for the pending balance or whether I just wait for the refund to go through, which could potentially take multiple hours/days.

frr4gj,wacky207,Buying the gam from the taleworlds website... or trying too,"Well half and half I’m really short on money atm but have been wating for this game since the announcement happened I’ve put a few hundred hours into the previous games

Anyway I’m on the website and the ten percent discount at launch has already appeared but I heard that you get another ten of you own a previous title which I own a couple of hehe but it goes straight to checkout pretty much just after asking for email address how to I get the other ten percent for a total of 20% discount? 

I know it probably not too much difference but depending on what that is I might not be able to get this game for months or maybe at all.....

It’s harder to do that now, you actually need better reflexes to counter your AI. Also the AI know how to feint an attack. Did I mention that spear is actually useful now?

frr0t4,CommanderSean12,How to improve performance (at the cost of graphics),"I have a shitty integrated graphics card so I was pretty scared that I was going to be unable to run the game. Unfortunately that turned out to be the case, but I have found a setting that you can modify that greatly increases performance at the cost of how it looks.

On windows if you navigate to your Documents folder you should see a Bannerlord folder. Navigate into it and navigate into the Configs folder. Open up engine_config.txt and look for the line

resolution_scale = 100

The lower you make that number, the worse your game will look but the better it will run. For reference I set mine to 50 and it made the game go from a stuttering mess in 100 v 100 to playable. Only issue I had was when I was in the middle of everything, but otherwise the game ran fine.

Can't promise this will be a cure all but it should help those of us with bad graphics cards. You might be able to play around with some of the other settings but I haven't touched them personally so I don't know how effective they would be outside of setting everything to the lowest already.",0,1585575785,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/frr0t4/how_to_improve_performance_at_the_cost_of_graphics/,mountandblade,1

And the Bannerlod.native, when launched with Windows 7 compatibility, reaches the first white screen and the launching with the horse moving and the crashes. 

The game is installed (it weights 50GB). I run Windows 7 with a I5 4670K, 16GB RAM and GTX1060 3Go. It should work. But it sadly does not. 

I tried to : 

* check the files with steam
* reinstall the game with steam
* shut down firewall and Avast
* update all the drivers
* reboot computer :)
* launch the app with admin and compatibility with windows 7

frq1br,photolouis,Perisno: Is there any point in marrying a princess?,"I joined Elintor (and spent way too long waiting for an opportunity to become marshal (like, seriously long time!)). Eventually, I married Princess Linthradil. She has her own town so she's not at court taking care of business. Oh well. I managed to accumulate enough property to go it alone. When the queen refused my request to grant me a castle I won by myself, I declared independence! Except my wife is still part of Elintor. Huh? I reloaded and tried a different approach. I convinced her that she was the rightful ruler. She agreed and said she's defer all matters of state to me. OK! Now I'm the marshal of the Kingdom of Perisno. I visited her town and there were no advisers there. My own town had my guys but I had no option to send a message to another kingdom. I'd really like to make peace with Elintor. I could grant myself a fief, however. When I next spoke to Linthradil, I saw no options other than to pledge myself to her. Huh? What's up with that.

The reports [here](https://www.protondb.com/app/261550) indicate the game is borked due to the somewhat recent addition of anti-cheat, but I think I've read installing the anti-cheat software is optional (since it's only ""needed"" for multiplayer)?

frnzjj,bizzub,Have fun guys,"With the release right around the corner, it's time to bid Warband farewell. Still can't believe how big of an impact the game had on me. I used to be a very shy kid. Then I joined a Napoleonic wars regiments and spend 2 whole years talking to other members on teamspeak. Then, with the help of kratom, I started actually socializing in real life. I hope playing Bannerlord will bring back some great memories when I get enough money to buy it soon lol. I am supposed to be ""maturing"" (graduating) at our local gymnazium (high school) in a small town in Moravia (Czechia) in the next month or so. It feels great to end it on a high note (with all that's going on right now). Anyway, sorry for this wall of text. I just wanted to share my feelings.

One of my worries is that it's going to be too similar to Warband. From the gameplay I've seen, it really just looks like a bit of a graphical update with smoother movement and animations. We had a lot of interesting stuff added in Warband with mods. I can't really think how Bannerlord will be able to introduce more stuff for it to really be a jaw dropper.

frmiz2,Brickman59,"T'was the night before Bannerlord,","When all through the house,

Not a Swadian stirring, not even Harlaus;

The butter was found round the kingdom with care,

In hopes that harvesting season soon would be there;

The Khergits were nestled all snug in their beds; 

While visions of horse-archers pranced in their heads;

And Khergit with horse, and Vaegir with Bow,

Watchful Rhodok slept, ready for new foe;



When out of the castle arose such a clatter,

I the Butterlord sprang out to see to the matter

Away to the manhole I peeked with a dash,

to see who at night would cause such a bash.

The moon on the breast of new-fallen snow

Gave lustre of midday to new objects below,

And what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But old Jeremus, and other companions near

With medical skill high and hairline low

He had brought the whole party in tow!

All joyously jumping with jubilant jaunt

To say one last goodbye, a friendly entente.

""Now Borcha, now Bunduk, and Bahesthur too! 

Katrin, Firentis, Klethi adieu! 

Nizar! Deshavi! Alayen! Artimenner! Lezalit!

Marnid and Matheld! Rolf and Ymira! All without further ado!

We bring glad tidings, to express ourselves as a crew!

You've helped us all time and time through,

and yet we have never yet to thank you!

So thank you dear butterlord, for time and time again

You've spent your time with us, your traveling friends!

We hope you enjoy your time in the land beyond,

and know that even if you miss us, 

in your heart we'll go on.""

And just like that they were there, and suddenly not

And in my brain I had a morose thought;

When still through the air I heard a masculine pitch,

The shine of Jeremus' head, gave him away like a snitch.

With verbose exclamation ringing through the air,

I smiled, and simply stood there.

frisjo,TheSimpleLooter,Saying Farewell To An Old Friend,"      Mount and Blade Warband….where do I even begin. For many of us out there, Warband was more than just a game, it defined childhoods, friendships, and an entire generation of gamers. Experiences that I cant even put into words. This game was filled with so many iconic moments and stories that YOU made, and that is what made the game beautiful. The struggle of spending months building up your army, only to risk it all in one decisive clash to decide the fate of the butter kingdom. It didn’t matter that the fighting was janky and blobbed, what mattered was that Jeremus was there by your side in the frontline, desperately swinging his staff, desperately trying to save HIS butter king. 
      This was more than just a game, it was a community, and I can say that you all are one of the best communities that gaming will ever see. Bannerlord is here, but nothing can take away what we all did for Warband, the Dev team worked tirelessly on Bannerlord, but it was YOU who kept the spirit of the game alive. It was YOU who stayed up for hours working on the next mod, it was YOU who stayed up robbing peasants in persistent world, and it was YOU who stayed up shit-posting about the butter king. Its hard to believe that ten years have passed, for many of us Warband was an oasis in the desert where we could find comfort in Jeremus’ sweet touch. The memories of warband will last a lifetime, and the friendships we built will last an eternity. From the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you, to YOU the community who made this game truly special, tomorrow we will wake up and fill our bellies with butter, laughter, and memes, but tonight lets look back on something truly special, Mount and Blade Warband.
      Its hard to ignore current events. For many of us out there we are going through hard times right now, and there are going to be more hard times to come; Bannerlord can serve as a beacon of hope and comfort that we turn to when the night is darkest. The sun is setting on Warband, and tomorrow when the sun rises Bannerlord will be here. With Warband fading into darkness, a new light emerges which will burn brighter than the likes we have ever seen. I’ll see you boys on the plains of Calaradia.

fri8gr,ShotgunJed,Your strategy to taking over a faction in Bannerlord?,"Since we can't make our own factions yet, if we want to rule, that means we'll have to take over an existing faction.

What faction will you want to take over and how?

Maybe get your son to marry the princess and play as your son to rule over the Southern Empire?

Will you instead rule from the shadows instead of title, holding influence over the king and the faction with your clan? (If that's even viable in the early release)

Assuming we can take our fiefs with us, if we leave the faction and join another (you can't do this in Warband, but I hope you can in Bannerlord), I am thinking of fighting for the empire, making the khanate weak, whilst at the same time building friendly relations with some of the khans. When the great Khan is weak and has prooved his incompetence to his Khans, I'll join up the khanate, challenge him and hopefully some of my allied lords will take my side, in hopes to restore the glory of the khanate.

I hope we can actually do something like this in the early access, otherwise it'll be disappointing.",4,1585534022,https://www.reddit.com/r/mountandblade/comments/fri8gr/your_strategy_to_taking_over_a_faction_in/,mountandblade,1
