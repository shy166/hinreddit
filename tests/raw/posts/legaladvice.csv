fsogen,freshoutafucks4ever,Can you use unemployment for booth rent?,"Our salon owner has stated we will indeed have to pay our weekly rent even thought we are shut down and can’t work for 7 weeks. (I understand this) However my question is if we apply for unemployment with the new rules letting self employed stylists apply for, can we use this money to pay our booth rent? Since booth rent is essentially how we run our self employed business. Would that be fueling our business monetarily, making us not unemployed?

fsofwd,RubMyRubberyDucky,"Insurance evaluator inspected our home and without inspection decided that our chimney needs to be replaced, we asked for a proper inspection and now our whole farm in no longer insured.","  
This is all a long shot but, this is going on in Quebec, Canada

So to basically summarize, as stated in the title we asked for a proper inspection, the evaluator argued against it and now 6 months later the company had decided to cancel the insurance on both homes, the 2 barns and all machinery on our property.  


A bit of backstory, the evaluator showed up sometime around September/October last year (2019) and inspected both our homes (not the barns or any other buildings on the farm), my house (Father and I) was determined to need a railing for the new deck we built. Not a problem but was questionable considering the stairs used only had 2 steps sticking out and the deck itself is no more than 3 feet off the ground, but whatever, we later did that and sent proof to the insurance company and was given the OK. My grandparents house right next door (We're two farms joined as one property with no others in-between) was told that they need to replace their whole chimney. The evaluator only entered the basement for no more than a minute or two and did no thorough inspection, difficult considering it's a bricked in/enclosed chimney pipe. My grandparents requested that a proper inspection be performed and the evaluator huffed and argued against it (We've never had any issues over this chimney before). My grandparents then asked why not and were not given an answer.  
Fast-forward to early this month (March 2020) and both my father and grandparents receive letters in the mail from the insurance company that they are canceling the insurance on both homes and the entire farm effective April 1st. Now despite us being angered by this, we decided to move on elsewhere (mainly considering that we were tired of this company and have heard of other being told off by them as well). My grandparents contacted another insurance company and were in the middle of setting up a new plan, when a few days go by and they get a call saying that the new company won't insure us because we're blacklisted (by name from what I've been told, meaning my grandfather and fathers names). From what I understand, since the old company canceled our insurance, it either red flagged us or the old company told others not to insure us. We're also in the middle of transferring the farm to my fathers name since my grandfather is becoming too old to do it anymore.   
Now we can't get insurance from anyone and we have a multi-building farm and lots of machinery to take care of. I will state that this is an old farm, but we have 10s of thousands of dollars invested in new equipment in the main dairy barn plus the value of the machinery both newer and older, the animals and so on. We're by far not a farm that doesn't require insurance.  


We're going to try and contact the insurance companies again to try and figure something out, but otherwise we have no idea what to do other than beg or pray we can go without. Is their any sort of legal action that could be taken? Or is this strictly a ""You're on your own"" scenario?",3,1585699126,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsofwd/insurance_evaluator_inspected_our_home_and/,legaladvice,1
fsofnd,umokyeah1234,Worked for the same company in Missouri and TX. Minimum wage is higher in Missouri and payroll never dropped my rate when I moved back to Texas.,So this question is super specific but i need help. So I work part time in retail while I’m in grad school. Was hired in TX and worked here for minimum wage ($7.25 an hour) for several months. In the fall I went home to MO for a clinical rotation for just 6 weeks. I was apparently off boarded at my store in Texas and I was “re hired” in the store in MO at minimum wage in That state ($8.60). Came back to TX without going through the re hire process and was just transferred back to my store. My name never showed up on tier rankings or anything for this store and I continued to be paid Missouri’s minimum wage which jumped to $9.45 starting in 2020. For obvious reasons I didn’t say anything. I was recently furloughed due to COVID and just got my second to last paycheck on Friday and they dropped me back down to $7.25 per hour. I know it’s illegal to cut my pay without notifying me but I’m afraid to say something because I don’t want them to garnish my pay from the last 3 months (was being paid $9.45 and TECHNICALLY should have been making $7.25). So my question is should I say something about most recent paycheck? Would they have grounds to take back that money if they chose to?,1,1585699103,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsofnd/worked_for_the_same_company_in_missouri_and_tx/,legaladvice,1
fsof9g,blakmaggie,"Lyft violated terms of service, permanently deactivated driver account without warning, stated cause, or chance to cure. Now won't respond. What do I do?","I've driven for Lyft for over a year and am in Georgia. I have had consistently good (99% 5 star) ratings and reviews (with frequent compliments on my driving safety), have never been given a formal complaint or warning about any kind of behavior, and have not been given any citations or been in any recent accidents.


Today, I received an email stating my account was permanently deactivated for ""safety-related concerns - like ratings, safety reports, accidents, and distracted driving"", but with no other specific information. The email also said that this decision was final and that for ""privacy reasons"" the support team could not assist me with it. 


I sent a help request asking for a phone call and within 7 minutes received a second email. This email stated that they would not be calling me since there was not an emergency, and to communicate via text or email. They also stated that the deactivation decision had ""been reviewed and will remain final"". Again, with no specific information as to the reason.


I replied saying I did not understand why my account had been deactivated, stated what I said here in my first paragraph, and asked to be told specifically why my account was deactivated. I also asked why I had not been given a chance to respond to the issue, especially given my record and the fact that Lyft's terms of service require that I be given ""opportunity to attempt to cure the issue to Lyft’s reasonable satisfaction prior to Lyft permanently terminating the Agreement."" And that I do not think ""reviewing"" the decision, without any input from me, in the (at most) 7 minutes between my request for contact and their email constitutes said opportunity. 


There has been no further response from Lyft so far (about 2 hrs). 


What do I do now? My inclination is to continue to reach out on a daily basis, stressing the terms of service issue, until someone responds. I can't afford to go into arbitration, but I'm willing to throw that potential around if it would help. And I can't really afford to be out of this job either, given how things are in the US right now and that rideshare is my primary income source. So.. what can I do? Am I just screwed?",5,1585699062,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsof9g/lyft_violated_terms_of_service_permanently/,legaladvice,0

fsoeb9,itwasntkyler,"[TX] Divorced, technically ex-wife and I have joint custody but she lives in another state. Is there a way this situation can be improved?","A few years ago I got divorced and based on an agreement I made with her that my dumb ass didn't get in writing, she was designated as the person who got to choose our son's place of residence. Shortly after the divorce finalized she moved out of state; I had no legal way of stopping her from doing so since I had designated the right to her.

I remained in Texas because of school and now work when my ex-wife moved up to Michigan with our son to live in the town she grew up in with her family as a support system. My goal has always been to get job experience and either find a job up there or move up there and continue my current job working remotely. My girlfriend, however, is not excited nor enthused about the prospect of having to leave her entire family here in Texas to move to Michigan where she has no one. We've had an argument about this for a while and her solution was to, somehow, via legal means, to get my ex wife to move back down to Texas. 

I am like 99.99% sure that there is nothing that exists that would legally require her, the person who has the right to designate our child's primary residence, to move down here. She isn't a bad mom, she works, she has a family up there with a support system. 

I have no idea if any of this makes sense. I just hastily wrote it up as a result of my girlfriend insisting that there is some legal way of making my ex wife move down to Texas and as I said I'm pretty sure it's not a thing that I can do, but I just want to do some preliminary research on the subject before I consider lawyering up and paying a trillion dollars I don't have to get laughed at for asking what I feel like is a stupid question.",4,1585698970,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsoeb9/tx_divorced_technically_exwife_and_i_have_joint/,legaladvice,1
fsoe2m,lindseee628,Traveling out of state with daughter during pandemic [IL] [NC],"Hi r/legaladvice!  

Currently going through child custody court.  My ex filed for relocation of my daughter to where he is stationed in the military. Currently judge has said no, and we have plans to begin reunification therapy and are on a waitlist. 

A couple of days ago, I got into a fight with my ex mother in law who currently has temporary custody of my daughter. This started because I told her I would help however needed and if she needed to end our court ordered call early due to my daughter misbehaving, I understand. During our texts I replied calmly and did not engage in fighting- stated I wanted to see my daughter, have a cordial coparenting relationship, and I am not agreeing to anything for the time being. 

During the conversation, She stated that I should allow her to move to North Carolina and “stop holding up child custody court”. She says my daughter is in therapy and has had emotional outbursts. I replied that I am not comfortable with this and we are planning on doing reunification therapy. 

Today I get a text that she is on the way to North Carolina to be with her father because my daughters great grandparents can not handle her emotional outbursts. I replied I did not agree with this. 

My Ex MIL and my daughters stepmother both live here in Illinois. They are in the car with her going to NC. I don’t see why this is happening, if my exes new wife is able to be there with my daughter. Daughters school is closed indefinitely, court will not reopen until May 18 at the earliest. 

What does this mean, and will my daughter be able to return to the state? We are in the middle of a pandemic, not only that but I am also worried for her safety. Is this kidnapping? What kind of laws are currently in law about travel from state to state in a pandemic? 

Lawyer is aware and notified and she says she is in contact with exMIL lawyer.

Sorry if this is a little scrambled- I’m panicking a bit.",0,1585698944,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsoe2m/traveling_out_of_state_with_daughter_during/,legaladvice,1
fsodwh,CursiveKay,Unpaid Leave,"I work a commission-based job in TN. We receive a weekly draw and a monthly commission check, which our draw is deducted from.
My job has been labeled as “essential”. However, I was told that if I wanted to stay home, I could do so, but I would have to sign a waiver stating I am voluntarily going on leave and therefore will no longer receive my weekly draw. Essentially, unpaid leave. I also have to have a designated end date to my leave. 
My issue with this is, several people in the same position as me have already taken leave from the company and are receiving their weekly draw. They were not forced to sign any waiver, and are being allowed to stay home “until this is all over”. Is it legal of them to force me to sign a waiver to go on leave without pay, and not others?",0,1585698926,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsodwh/unpaid_leave/,legaladvice,1
fsociz,JimBobNeedsAGun,[Ca] Girlfriends ex-husband sent a man to my house to intimidate me.,"
Title says. I been seeing a woman going through a divorce. He had won visitation rights with the child. He is doing semi-illegal things to scare his wife into going back with him. She was in a domestic abuse protection program. 

A week ago, he held the son ""Ransom"" for about $200 and said he needed money for his electric bill. She paid him to get her son back. This caused a fight in our relationship, and we stopped talking for a week, most likely we are breaking up.

Today I got a visit from a very large man covered in tattoos. He had my personal information, name, and social security number. He claimed he was investigating ""Id fraud"" - He pulls out a picture of my girlfriend and says he wanted to talk about her.

I go out to talk to him and he begins telling me that ""He's politely asking me to walk away"" from the situation. And that ""She's is back with her husband now, and she's been sleeping around with various guys, etc."" 

He wouldn't divulge who he worked for, or who sent him, but it was obvious it was from her ex husband. He must have tracked my information down, by interrogating the child. After all of that, I get his license plate and he leaves.

Do I have any course of action? I doubt I do as no laws were broken.",1,1585698788,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsociz/ca_girlfriends_exhusband_sent_a_man_to_my_house/,legaladvice,1
fsocil,DarksoraXIII,Landlord sent me to collections w/o an outstanding balance,"Rent is due tomorrow. I live in Ohio. My landlord (a company) called me this afternoon checking to see ""how we were doing."" What I told the lady was the truth, ""We're fine this month, although if this isolation continues we might be in trouble.""

But then, several hours later I received a call from a collections agency saying that my landlord sent me to them. I double-checked after the call, and I have no outstanding debt, and we're still on schedule to pay tomorrow. They said my address and the name of the complex, so I'm pretty sure it's legit. He hung up after I said I was disputing that claim.If it is legit, what's going on here?? Is my landlord just pre-sending their tenants to collections? I'm very curious if this has happened to anyone else. I'm inclined to join in on the rent strike movement if my landlord is gonna act this sketchy.",20,1585698786,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fsocil/landlord_sent_me_to_collections_wo_an_outstanding/,legaladvice,3
