fsob4w,Randomplayeri,Why is Michael Burry not in the logo of this sub?," Literal OG Wall Street better:

\- No official education in business 

\- Saw the opportunity no one else did

\- Did a ton of his own research

\- Made his own financial instrument with banks because nobody had done a bet like this before (""literally can't go tits up"")

\- Made possibly the craziest bet ever on Wall Street

\- Everyone doubted this guy and laughed at him

\- Ended up making hundreds of millions

lazy ppl TLDR; Antibody-tests are on their way. As soon as they start **broad testing, get CASH GANG**

&amp;#x200B;

1) Introduction

Let me explain.

Something that has not been discussed a lot from what I hear on discord/read in the sub: **antibody** testing. Yeah I get, shit is bad and world will collapse and so on but hear me out - the permabulls will take any major positive news for a good 10% rally. 

Antibody testing is already done in New York and testing capacities are about to be expanded:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)

Additionally the head of the Charit√®  - most reputable medical institution in Germany - announced that there will be anti-body testing of big groups in **around 2 weeks.**

Source (GERMAN - ENG sub):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ)

&amp;#x200B;

2) Conclusion

While we are riding into an economic armageddon, we still wanna ride the waves up and down. After we will get a big downie from SPY being rejected at 263, we will still see a **massive rally** at the time when **antibody tests are shown to be effective in just a single country** because it will most likely be the same data for all the other countries. I can only give a timeframe, which would be somewhere between  **4/14-21**

&amp;#x200B;

3) Side-takeaway:

Everyone who is doing ""diamond"" hands - if you don¬¥t have leaps, you should probably switch to trading with the trend/go more Cash because while we will get a lot of bad news - there will also be very promising good news soon.

fsnubq,hasbs,Contacted by Questrade Legal team for permission to share my login and trade data,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/

Please consider reading that before the following if you haven't already. 

I've already posted these emails on that thread but Questrade asked for permission to post it as well and of course I said yes. 


Here is their email:

https://imgur.com/a/dTQTUDT

Seems the text is a bit small in that screenshot so here is another one: 

https://ibb.co/wJFgDDL


Here is my response:

https://imgur.com/a/Jm5k1Tp

https://ibb.co/mtn3Q4R




So again, while I was able to log in at certain times I couldn't sell the position. Here is a similar issue that I was able to screenshot from the following day: 

https://imgur.com/a/Q2JsU6G

(These are the same photos I attached to the legal team) 

Also you can see that there were serious outages earlier in the day when I had other less time sensitive positions and if you look at their twitter feed there were some serious outages from the previous week too.

Not sure how to prove this but here is a screenshot of me messaging my friends on whatsapp with timestamps when it happened:

https://imgur.com/a/6OEocD8


This isn't a one time issue and even if Questrade wants to make it seem like I am 100% responsible for these losses, even though their trade desk analyst said ""I did not see the technical issues as being that much of a factor in terms of losses"" implying there were still ""**a**"" factor I think its important for people to know they can't really use Questrade for active trading regardless. 

If the screenshots aren't working and you want to read a text transcript of the emails I will put them in the comments and put the links here momentarily.

Thanks.


Edit: Seems like some of you guys are missing the point. Ignore my trades for a moment. Ignore the fact that before 11am I still had around 50k of a triple leveraged ETF and weekly options in my account I couldn't access.

A broker went down for hours at a time. 

Multiple days during an extremely volatile trading period.

They had issues with deposits and issued margin calls for their own error. 

They were unable to process market orders for over an hour.

They are allowing people to deposit money into their accounts while the account is not verified so the person is unable to trade. 

Do you not see how these are issues in itself. I still was unable to access a large volatile position for hours at a time... 

I'm not blaming them solely for the loss. It wasn't a good trade but my point is I should be able to access any and every position at all times.",283,1585696997,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/,wallstreetbets,57

fsnrup,zephyrtaru,Yolo 488k Spy Puts,"[https://imgur.com/a/aXjabQJ](https://imgur.com/a/aXjabQJ) Pos: SPY 200p 4/17

Further to my previous post, there had been two days of extended losses.

I'd like to share with you all an update from a risk management perspective. Given that I am right and market is wrong, in order to capture this tremendous and beautiful opportunity, I must buy more. Buying more obviously lowers my risk as my cost average is lower, this should be common sense to everyone. This is an important lesson in risk management to you all.

Taking a page from portfolio rebalancing from modern portfolio theory, I am adding double the position for maximum risk mitigation; but instead of 50/50 stock/bond, I use 50/50 put/put. This is an advanced technique so please don't all start to copy me unless you have done your homework.

See you Apr 1.

Edit: There was a question from a previous thread about why 200 strike was selected. Here is my rationale: The option chain for my broker is listed from lower number to higher number, and given that 4/17 is a monthly expiry date, there is a large number of SPY strikes. I got tired after scrolling down two pages so I decided 200 is sufficient effort.

I believe were going to TEST the market one way or another, the experts are saying it about to be a big move. I don't know if I believe that.. but look at the chart who knows what its going to do, but believe me it will be a big move in one way or another. The magnitude of this test, Jim, is going to be massive. One of my good friends Mr. Powell, some call him a leader in this industry.. I don't know if I would say that but some would say it, is going to lead the charge unlike any charge seen before. He said he needed 2 Trillion.. I think it could be in the range of 50 trillion and some experts even say 100 trillion. Like I said, the worst 2 weeks in American history.. Spy 220 thank you all and here is Mike Pence with 900 days to stop the spread.

It is an incredible to buy otm calls in the mid-long term horizon.

fslqzm,ZamanMahmoudi,The sell off has been cushioned by the fed unlimited QE.,"The liquidity of the market and the uncertainty of the future has pushed the markets to plummet more than 35% in just 1 month of trading. The end of this quarter marks the worst quarter in the history of this country. We are expecting a GDP drop of 9% in Q1, 34% in Q2, and then a substantial rebound in Q3. With the infusion of QE by the fed, we are seeing an infusion of capital that eases liquidity concerns and cushions the volatility of the markets. The fed is prepared to enact unlimited QE for as long as it is necessary to cushion the fall and signal to all that it‚Äôs OK we will get through this and we will persevere. While there is still room to fall in the near term, a recession is inevitable, and we have still not returned to the mean, there is hope on the horizon that we will recover and continue our journey to all time highs. The insane volatility that occurred prior to the QE announcement is over and while the markets may slowly ease lower over multiple months, the 5-10% daily moves will be extremely rare to see.

Believe it or not - you have several good reasons to believe the sky isn't falling. In fact, it may be clearing up.

The economy is in trouble and fear rules Wall Street. No wonder. Banks and other financial companies are posting huge losses. The Federal Reserve has had to engineer a rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns. Home prices are sinking.

The Fed is cutting interest rates to battle recession, but the stock market refuses to be calmed. The Dow swings wildly even as it teeters on the edge of a bear market. And oil keeps rising while the dollar keeps falling. It's all unsettling in the extreme.

But the really scary question is, What's next? Are we at the start of a deep recession and a crushing decline in stock prices? And however serious the problems, how can you best protect your investments?

I'd argue that if you apply a little long-term thinking to the worries that are keeping you up at night, you may well conclude that the outlook for your portfolio isn't so bad - and in fact, that it may even be mildly encouraging.

First, Italy hit 100 (95) cases on February 25th, the United States hit 100 (98, 3more than Italy) cases on March 6th. We are 11 days behind Italy. Scientific evidence: https://imgur.com/a/6ZaFrCv

Italy hit it‚Äôs peak 10 days ago, and since we‚Äôre 11 days behind them, we will hit out peak tomorrow. Tomorrow cases will go up, the next day, down. More evidence: https://imgur.com/a/2CQqcgx

fskx6r,MortalDionysus,Public Service Announcement: PDT Rule ONLY Applies To MARGIN Accounts!,"I've seen many people getting this wrong the last few weeks, due to noobies from /r/all who don't know what they are doing...

**Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule only applies to MARGIN accounts.**

The $25,000 minimum to avoid PDT rule therefore also only applies to MARGIN accounts.

A cash account cannot fall under the PDT rule, although there are a few cash rules that need to be followed:  [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations) 

According to Regulation T, you can make as many day trade (round trip) stock purchases using a cash account as you wish, as long as you have the settled funds to cover each and every round trip sale.

Keep in mind brokerages may have their own rules so contact them to be 100% sure. Do your own research of course, I'll just quote Wikipedia as a quick reference:

&gt; **Pattern day trader** is a [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Industry_Regulatory_Authority) (FINRA) designation for a [stock market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market) [trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_trader) who executes four or more [day trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading) in five business days in a [margin account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_account)   
&gt;  
&gt; The main rule is that in order to engage in pattern day trading you must maintain an equity balance of at least $25,000 in a margin account.   
&gt;  
&gt; The Pattern Day Trading rule regulates the use of margin and is defined only for margin accounts. Cash accounts, by definition, do not borrow on margin, so day trading is subject to separate rules regarding Cash Accounts. Cash account holders may still engage in certain day trades, as long as the activity does not result in [free riding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_riding), which is the sale of securities bought with unsettled funds. 

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern\_day\_trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader#Day_trading_in_cash_accounts)

One finance textbook I read explained that the stock market is always infinitely forward looking so everything is ""priced in"". Did it occur to anyone that the Fed is printing ""infinite"" amount of cash to manipulate the market. So remember in calculus, shits get weird when we are dealing with infinity (i.e. injecting infinite cash into infinitely forward looking market). Given the l'hopital's rule, we need to keep taking the derivative until the equation is solvable. All this time the answer is right in front of us: more derivative &gt;&gt; double down on calls and puts!!

I don't interact here much but I have found myself reading a lot of threads lately and everyone seems to have an idea about where the market will head in the next few months, my idiot self included.  Since I know none of you know what the hell you're talking about I figured I'd just show you that you don't with an experiment.  I have opened a google survey which will remain open until the end of the day tomorrow where each of us can put in where we think the dow will be at the end of April, May, ... all the way to September (6 months).  When the time comes I'll compare the results to what actually happened this next 6 months and we can finally see if the sub is too bear or bull.

Yes I am aware the S&amp;P is a better indicator.

Anyways please fill out the survey with numeric answers only so we can all see that we're mentally impaired.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll need a google account:

fsk2uz,Vi0lentByt3,Reduced hours at work snd temporary lay offs,"My company, office is in usa but our corporation is australian based, just announced some lay offs and everyone is on reduced hours from 1-2 days. We are a travel company, so this obviously isnt a surprise. However, what I can tell you is that the amount of cash on our balance sheet(not gonna link, its public info, my only hint will be that we trade on the asx and lost 80% of our value in the last month and trading is still halted for our stock) is 70% client cash. This means we collected it from customers but owe it to our suppliers and vendors. It means we report that as cash on hand but never actually realize it ourselves.

This illustrates how fucked many companies are. Even if they were solvent. All it takes is a few months without revenue and these companies cannot stay above water. No matter how much money any government throws at these corporations, it will not matter, because there is no customer base.

Do not fall for this bull trap. All the stimulus has done is stop the bleeding, it has not resolved the problem, and it never will. My favorite quote for the current situation was here on wsb, ‚Äúthe government is throwing money at a problem that does not accept cash‚Äù, this is what you need to remember every time you enter a trade. 

I am long theta for now since IV is still absurd. I am selling short strangles, with far otm puts, at least 10-20% below current, and atm calls. Looking to bag hold if assigned because of the vol.

fsjalk,CuriousConvict,Insider trading AMA #2. One year later.,"
Over one year ago I made an AMA about going to federal prison for insider trading as a financial analyst at Amazon -([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ajfpcr/qa_i_was_prosecuted_for_insider_trading_in_2017/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)). 

TLDR; I was a financial analyst at Amazon and sold pre-earnings financial information to a friend days before the Q1 2015 earnings call.  I was approached by the FBI 2 years later in 2017 and plead guilty in September 2017, sentenced December 2017.  I served a 6 month sentence in federal prison from January - July 2018.  In August 2019 I was granted early release from supervised release (probation) and have been living life as 'normal' ever since.  

There‚Äôs been some interest expressed in a second AMA. A lot has happened in my life since the last one. So I‚Äôm here to answer questions about life as an ex con as well as life in prison and the general experience with the FBI and SEC.  I‚Äôm sure a lot of questions will be answered by referring to the first AMA. 

I was released from ‚Äúsupervised release‚Äù aka probation a year early in August, and since then I‚Äôve been living my best life! 

Feel free to DM if you have specific questions you don‚Äôt want to ask here.

Cheers autists,

CuriousConvict

Edit: prison rape jokes are HILARIOUS and I‚Äôve never heard them in my life.  The guys asking about this are the same ones buying box spreads. 

Edit2: I encourage everyone seeing this for the first time to go to the first AMA, link below. Happy to answer new questions but a lot of common questions can be answered by reading the first AMA.

Edit3: You guys have asked about what I'm doing now.  At the last AMA, I was working two dead-end jobs to make ends meet, as a pizza delivery driver and making itineraries at a travel company.  I was released a year early from ""supervised release"" aka probation in August 2019.  I got an amazing opportunity to work as a poker coach for a group of poker players and play poker myself.  I moved to Bali in October 2019 where I've been based since.  I tried for a long time to get back into corporate finance but couldn't secure any jobs because of my history.  I was even given a couple of very generous job offers which were rescinded when my history came to light.  Now I play poker poker full time online in Asia and do some financial analysis jobs on the side as a contractor.  I escaped the corporate life but I still get to enjoy the skills I spent a lifetime working towards.  Life has never been better.  Despite the 'felon' label I'm able to live freely and trade, work, and travel as I please.",323,1585682376,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsjalk/insider_trading_ama_2_one_year_later/,wallstreetbets,127

Today, the volume on a $92 PUT expiring April 3rd soared to almost 250,000. With a .23 premium, that's 5.75 million dollars. The 50 day average option volume for ALL options on $IWM is 104,000. This single option has a volume of **250,000**. The current total put option volume is 550,000. That's 5x the average TOTAL option volume.

https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/IWM/OptionSummary/

Now this is weird because with $IWM currently sitting at $113, a $92 strike put is so far OTM that the price would have to drop significantly by this friday or those would all expire worthless. 

It could be possible someone with a lot invested in the underlying stock is hedging, but that would be a massive hedge, and there hasn't been any dramatic change in stock volume in the past 30 days.

fsit3k,18845683,Is the market really not pricing in the likelihood of epidemic resurgence once lockdowns are relaxed?,"Is the market really not pricing in the likelihood of epidemic resurgence once lockdowns are relaxed?

One interpretation of the current stubbornly optimistic SPX is that it‚Äôs all the Fed.  Another is that it‚Äôs EOM rebalancing.  A third interpretation is that the market sees the end of this epidemic soon, and has priced it in like the yearly flu epidemic. (Obviously, none of these are mutually exclusive).  As far as I‚Äôm aware, the leading model ostensibly [confirms this outlook](https://i.imgur.com/DmHQm4h.png)- an April peak and then decline thereafter- but some important caveats: it doesn‚Äôt look beyond August, and it also seems to trust China‚Äôs apparently successful suppression of new cases, although SK and Germany represent other apparent models to emulate.  Is it realistic to expect the problem to go away after the first wave?

An [influential UK-focused modeling paper from March 16](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) modeled that current lockdowns/social distancing indeed will allow UK cases to crest around late April, below hospital surge capacity.  

But it also found that relaxation of current suppression measures will allow a resurgence: [Figure 3 from Ferguson et al. 2020](https://i.imgur.com/xsKHvKo.png).  

With adequate surveillance, and continued measures protecting the elderly and immunocompromised, you can open the economy after the disease subsides, and reimpose lockdown suppression once cases rise above a trigger level:

[Figure 4 from Ferguson et al. 2020](https://i.imgur.com/1O7f2On.png)

However, note that this does not model proactive test, trace and isolate like in SK, just on-off of suppression measures.  We may get better at it over time, [Ferguson says]( https://i.imgur.com/B98tBOj.png), with SK as a model.


What about SK? [This is what SK‚Äôs new case history has looked like](https://i.imgur.com/YYN8cb9.png).  They did this *without* widespread lockdowns or social distancing, just with very intensive test, trace, and isolate.  However, do you think the US will be able to impose a ‚Äúlaw that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease‚Äù?

How about Germany?  Germany instituted widespread test-and-trace fairly early on, with some success (notably on its CFR, although that‚Äôs possibly due to its more China-like method of naming cause of death).  Its new case trajectory looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/5wr8B4Z.png).  However, Germany [still had to institute lockdowns](http://archive.is/lp5mS), with significant community spread, unlike SK.  Germany, notably, doesn‚Äôt have access to the data SK does, although things like a [mobile app](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/27/world/europe/27reuters-health-coronavirus-germany.html) have been bandied about.  

**Germany example tl;dr**: Germany is probably a best-case scenario for the US once we get this under control, because of Western civil liberties.  **But it still took a shutdown to accomplish it.**  This, one could imagine, militates in favor of a dynamic like in Ferguson et al. Fig 4.

Some questions:

**Can Germany or the US adopt a cluster-suppression SK approach once the current epidemic has died down?**

**Does emulating Korea require invasive measures that won‚Äôt fly in the West, or can workarounds be found?**

Positions for everyone to inverse:

The model relevant for the US, [medrxiv paper here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.20043752v1), updated projections [here](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections), also confirms [the peak coming in mid-April and declining thereafter](https://i.imgur.com/DmHQm4h.png) (current as of Mar 31).  They assume current social distancing and nonessential business closure will be in place for the duration.  They also essentially assume that the epidemic *can* be brought to heel, and that new epidemics can be suppressed, [based mostly on China‚Äôs example](https://i.imgur.com/vfn379y.png):

&gt;**‚ÄúMany other locations, including all other provinces in China, have so far successfully contained transmission, preventing a general outbreak‚Äù**

 They also don‚Äôt really model post-first-wave epidemics, only to the completion of the current, but say: 

&gt;‚ÄùModeling for US states based on one completed epidemic, at least for the first wave, and many incomplete epidemics is intrinsically challenging.‚Äù

On that front, the best-case examples would be Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Germany.  

In South Korea, the intensive test, trace, and enforced isolation of suspected cases has so far been able to mostly squelch the disease at the cluster level (of course, without serological surveys, it‚Äôs hard to know this for sure).

Check this out:

&gt;*South Korea is also enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease.*

&gt;*The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested.*

&gt;*People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through an app or checked regularly in telephone calls until a hospital bed becomes available. When this occurs, an ambulance picks the person up and takes them to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms.*

[13 Mar source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/italy-south-korea-differ-tackling-coronavirus-outbreak-200313062505781.html)

New clusters have been identified and pursued, and it remains to be seen whether SK‚Äôs success will hold ([Mar 17 source](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/coronavirus-cases-have-dropped-sharply-south-korea-whats-secret-its-success#)), but [this is what SK‚Äôs new case history has looked like](https://i.imgur.com/YYN8cb9.png).  They did this without widespread closures of nonessential businesses; things like museums have reopened since mid-March.

fsinqe,dukeofmuffinz,Theory on why stonks going up,"This weekend, while my girl's boyfriend was coming over to visit her for some ""private time,"" I ventured to the beach to meet some friends.

During this pandemic many of them are either working from home or have lost there jobs and seeking unemployment.  As I looked around the desolate wasteland that was the beach, and noticed many other younger people my age, I asked my friends what they were doing for money in the mean time...and the answer might surprise you.

You see, like myself, my friends are retarded and they have all just started investing into the stock market!  They aren't option trading but they are buying stocks!  I kid you not when they laughed at me and said, ""well stocks are on sale now so I am buying in now.""

Stocks, on sale?  Why didn't I know this???  They are buying into SPY and one of them is buying oil!  Fucking OIL!  OIL that is being overproduced, that is not being bought because no one is using it (cruise lines, airlines, joe schmoe and even themselves!)

I was and still am lost for words.  If these 7 people said they were just now buy stocks just imagine how many other tards are buying stocks now because they are ""on sale.""

fsiis4,Bangthefishdied,Snapchat will hit $11 and you will make a lot of money,"Me and the autists over in the discord have been discussing our autistic stock, SNAP.

After some research on GDP correlation to Online Marketing, OM decreases exponentially in relation to GDP loss. Further escalating this, the quarantine means movie marketing, retail marketing, and local business marketing budgets have tanked. This is a godzilla sized piece of SNAP's revenue. For the record, analysts predict a 9% GDP drop this quarter, and up to 30% second quarter.

 [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-slashes-second-quarter-134947909.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-slashes-second-quarter-134947909.html)

SNAP isn't currently profitable. Further more, losing a measly 5% of online marketing is going to severely hurt the company, watch for their Q1 earnings on Apr 21st after-market. Investors WILL anticipate massive losses this quarter.

fsi19z,YT-JustLivinLife,Response to deleted post‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in the big short‚Äù,"First off I spent to long writing this argument for that autist to delete his post and me not to post it. 


Unemployment: Projections are that 40 million will be unemployed. Let‚Äôs say 30 million are unemployed even if 1:10 don‚Äôt get there job back that‚Äôs still 3 million unemployed which beats 2008 unemployment by 400 thousand. 
Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/business/worldbusiness/09iht-jobs.4.19232394.html

Assets: Even when quarantine is over people aren‚Äôt going to be running out to buy as many things as they were before. People will be more cautious still not eating out from fears of still getting the disease or fear of loosing job again. This will take a couple of years for people to get back to their old spending levels and forget about saving money.  Like bill gates said ""It's very tough to say to people, 'Hey keep going to restaurants, go buy new houses, ignore that pile of bodies over in the corner, we want you to keep spending because there's some politician that thinks GDP growth is what counts,'""

The Fed: Obviously they are gonna try and keep the market up I can‚Äôt hate them for that. If they don‚Äôt do anything the people will hate them for not doing anything. (The bad part is that the stocks will hit harder when the virus is at its worse.)

COVID: No matter how dangerous the disease is now doesn‚Äôt really matter the fear is already stuck in everyone‚Äôs mind. This fear will translate economically as stated in the assets section above

Media: There‚Äôs always going to be fear mongering articles but not sure how much you can call an article fear mongering when it says there aren‚Äôt enough ventilators for people in Italy.

fshocw,AvgJoeCrypto,Emotional and Financial toll from this virus may take years to normalize,"Fellow geniuses, let me guide you through what many will consider a totally inept analysis of the virus impact.

First, I am not a ""permabear"" despite many bearish posts and comments. However, I was already bearish prior to this virus, thinking the party had gone on too long and we needed a correction. It would be nice for   people not to lose money, and everything be great, however I am a realist.

*TL;DR: This virus is here for awhile and that will impact consumer behavior longer than just a few months. Even with a cure or vaccine, the emotional toll of having to deal with the seasonal flu, plus coronavirus, could take years to normalize. The economic impact will be substantial.*

**'This virus is going to be with us'**

&gt;I'm hopeful that we'll get through  this *first wave* and, and have some time to prepare for the *second wave*.  I'm hopeful that the private sector in its ingenuity and working with the government, NIH, will develop a vaccine that ultimately will change the impact of this virus. 

&gt;But for the next ***24 months***, you know, we're all in this together, and the most important thing  that we can do  is twofold: the American public fully embracing the  social distancing that we requested to protect the vulnerable; and secondly, to operationalize the bread and butter of public health, you know, early case identification, isolation, contact tracing, so that this outbreak does not get the upper hand, as it has, unfortunately, in New York City, in northern New Jersey, and now New Orleans.- CDC  Director

[CDC Director - This Virus Will Be With Us](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/31/824155179/cdc-director-on-models-for-the-months-to-come-this-virus-is-going-to-be-with-us)

This is not going away after the first wave. We will have a second wave,  and  most likely another after that. We all know the flu by itself kills tens of thousands annually, even with a vaccine available for years.

People are used to the Flu, it has been with us for a long time. But it still kills many people worldwide each year. Now, imagine adding a new virus that we are all scared of to every flu season. If you did not get it   during the first wave, you probably don't want to get it in the second or third. *This fear will greatly impact many people's behavior*. How they travel, spend, etc, and this will impact the economy for an extended length of time.

**One in three Americans say a household member has been laid off or had their pay cut**

&gt;Fully a third of Americans have someone in their household who‚Äôs been  laid off or lost pay. The economic and humanitarian damage here is    incredibly widespread, even more than the unemployment claims data suggests. 

&gt;The Google Trends data  is especially alarming right now, because searches for ‚Äúfile for unemployment‚Äù are far, far higher than they were in the depths of the  Great Recession.

&gt;Two economists, the University of Minnesota‚Äôs Aaron Sojourner and Yale‚Äôs Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, have [built a model for predicting unemployment claims](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) based on news reports. Their [initial model](https://www.epi.org/blog/coronavirus-record-breaking-spike-in-ui-claims/) nearly nailed the 3.3 million number, predicting 3.4 million new claims. They [now project 4.7 million new claims](https://twitter.com/paulgp/status/1243204614125649924) for the week ending March 27, a huge spike from an already record number.

[Vox - Economic Number](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/30/21184401/coronavirus-covid-19-economy-charts)

Even with government checks and recovery money, many of these companies and jobs won't come back. Weak businesses, the small mom and pop types, who  were already struggling, won't make it through this. *Unemployment will remain elevated longer than some anticipate.*

We had already seen a shift to many people working for themselves, also known as the gig economy. Many of these people are either already unemployed or will remain underemployed for months, if not years. This   includes everyone from subcontractors, to your self employed business owners.

Multiple articles have popped up about different industries that are seeing an impact. Here are a few  mentioned recently:

* Ridesharing (Uber, Lift, Scooters, Bikes)
* Restaurants (Chains, Bars, mom and pop, food trucks)
* Wedding Industry (Venues, Caterers, Photographers, Florists)
* Gambling (Casinos, Online, Vegas)
* Sports (Local indoor fields, gyms, rinks, youth sports, local leagues, races)
* Travel (Hotels, Airbnb, Airlines, Airports, Planners, Cruises, Tours, Cities)
* Oil (Certain States, companies, WTI)
* Retail (Malls, Local Independent Stores, some chains)
* Motion Picture (Studios, Labor, Theater)
* Home Services (Landscapers, Small Construction, Builders)
* Personal Services (Barbers, Spas, Salons, Pet Care, Child Care, Nannies, Home Health Aids)
* Real Estate (2nd homes, Rentals, Realtors)
* Music &amp; Arts (Concerts, Galleries, Venues)
* Auto (local dealers, new cars, big 3)

**34% GDP Plunge**

&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects the U.S. economy to experience a far deeper slump than previously anticipated as the coronavirus pandemic hammers  businesses, causing a wave of mass unemployment.

&gt;The  world‚Äôs largest  economy will shrink an annualized ***34%***   in the second  quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 24%, economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a report. Unemployment will soar to *15%* by mid-year, up from a  previous forecast of 9%, they wrote.

&gt;The economists, however, now expect a  stronger recovery in the third quarter, with gross domestic product  expanding 19%.‚ÄúOur estimates imply that a bit more than half of the  near-term output  decline is made up by year-end,‚Äù they wrote. While  there‚Äôs a risk of   longer-term fallout on income and spending, the  aggressive action by the Federal Reserve and the government should  help to contain this.

[Goldman Sees Deeper Plunge](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sees-even-deeper-u-080522193.html)

34% is just a massive impact. They do expect a strong recovery (as do  many)  but it still won't immediately make up for the total hit we will  take. One can't help but wonder how much of this won't go away, and how  long  it will take to get back on track.

**Conclusion:**

We will get out of this and life will return to normal. However, those calling bottoms, and talking V shape recovery in only a month or so may be shortsighted. People will spend less going forward, impacting all   areas of the economy. The emotional and financial toll of this virus may take years to fully normalize.

Position: Overall outlook for the next few months or so is bearish, despite the irrational exuberance of the bulls this past week.

fsgiso,thatbuzzguy,The Darkest Timeline: The Markets and Idiocracy,"Yes, JPow threw the kitchen sink at the markets, and made the money machine motorboat the market's vast tracks of land.  Yes, it destroyed, or is currently destroying many aspiring autistic fortunes.  

(Possible unpopular opinion): it was the right thing to do, and possibly one of the most important police actions of the century.  

This is where Idiocracy comes in.  We have watering the economy with Brawndo for 11 years.  The money machine and the interest shredder have been running regularly during that time.  Corporate debt, auto loans, CLOs and various other warnings have been flashing red for some time as a result of the markets being out of balance for so long.  Enter the biggest monster truck ever built (beer virus), please notice that the collective wealth of the county has a dildo strapped to the roof. 

Fast forward a smidge, a quarter of the country gets fired, and we aren't even through the first two months of an 18 months of pre-vaccine fun.  Imagine if JPow hadn't thrown the kitchen sink in to slow this shit down.  Imagine 3/4 or more of the country unemployed, and sitting around during a single month.  This brings us to the point where people *could* be climbing the gates of the White House.  They aren't.  The market is up some.  Armageddon has been rescheduled for after we finish talking about Tiger King.  This could be the riot to end all riots, but instead it is Quarantine and chill.  The markets are in a temporary holding pattern while the bad news slowly escalates to the point where no amount of printing will make boomers buy stock.

At this point nothing is going to grow naturally where we have salted the ground so heavily with the thirst mutilator.  The markets are le screwed.  The only solution is to switch off the printer and shredder and let the market correct and then rebuild itself.  The old Gay Bears were always going to win, eventually.  But they have to be fat and lazy enough to wait out the long printer winter.  

Unhedged options are always going to be high-risk high-reward venture.  Time it wrong, and you will just watch your account value go down like a fake martial arts sensei getting a punch to the head.  I would urge caution while things unravel in commercial mortgages, auto loans and derivatives.  Don't be stupid, and go all in on gold or bonds, as anything with value is likely to be liquidated to cover margin calls if we take another major dip.  

Be aware that people are dying in droves across the globe.  others are realizing quietly that they have a half million worth of mortgage and no way to pay it back.  Still others are eyeballing 401k withdrawals to cover the $1100 Model 3 payment due in the next week.  How long is watching ""Ow My Balls"" going to keep people from panicking?  As an aging semi-gay bear, I am still glad that we didn't go to zero weeks ago.  Stay safe, and try not to lose all your money before things actually get going.

fsg1ba,java1450,Unemployment is A LOT higher than expected,"There two essential steps in applying for unemployment benefits. 

1 Completing the application, either online or by phone.

2 Talking to a claim specialist about your situation

The problem is with step 2. Im speaking for New York, but I‚Äôm sure other states are suffering too. 

Ive been trying to get a specialist on the phone for the past week with no avail. 

New York has added extra people to work for the unemployment office. They extended hours and days of operation. 

But if you call from dusk till dawn chances of your call getting through are slim.

And a lot of people are having the same problems.


https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/03/27/workers-laid-off-due-to-coronavirus-cant-get-through-to-unemployment-office/amp/

Now what does that mean. It means we are lagging WAY behind the actual numbers. 

Until we see more open phone lines, unemployment numbers are going to keep sky rocketing. 

With that being said Im guessing markets are going up 20% because of this.

TLDR: Unemployment numbers are way under exaggerated. So buy calls because nothing makes sense.

I still think there is another leg down, short term volatility cannot be predicted, I am not buying anything for a long term hold today. This is just a perspective on the mid to long term. 

Abbott Laboratories got emergency permission from the FDA to produce their COVID-19 test that produces a positive in as little as 5 minutes, negative in 13. They are going to produce 5 million tests in April: https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/detect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minutes.html


This has implications FAR beyond the immediate benefit in flattening the curve and saving front-line healthcare workers, BOTH OF WHICH IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY. The 5 million tests being produced are basically fancy swabs to put into a machine, as described, about the size of a toaster. 


This medical toaster. Fancy medical machinery, must be expensive, right? Is $10,040 expensive? https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-influenza-a-b-alere-i-instrument/23046617


It may be for your broke ass. Is $10,040 expensive for your local Walmart store, to test all their employees before their shift starts in the flu season? 

Do American parents think $10,040 is too big of a one-time cost for little Susie's elementary school to test the teachers likewise? 

Is $10,040 too expensive for Disney to put one in EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEES-ONLY AREA AT DISNEY WORLD? 


They will obviously get FDA approval, if not the model as-is, they will revise it. I am speculating that production at massive scale will make swab costs negligible in the long term. Larger players and metro areas will have the cash to buy in sooner. 


By Fall life is back to normal with some adjustments, economy back to normal, if it isn't already. As I write this out I'm not actually sure we've even going to have another big leg down at all. (Until the consequences of infinite money come about, which could be 3 months to never)


TL;DL: By 2021 you will be subject to forced rectal swabs by both government and private parties at will, but SPY is at 400 and grandma is probably still alive.


EDIT: I would love to hear the a bearish take on this. My own further research:

-Flu A/B tests cost about $100 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-flu-a-b-2-mod-24t-pk/23046634

-Strep A/B tests are about $77 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-strep-a-2-test-kit/23046632

-RSV test kits are $90 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-rsv-test-kit-24-pk/23043632

-They also sell ""control swabs"" at approx. $20 each that are sold in pack of 24; I assume these are consumable as well. 


So a flu test is $120 inclusive, today. I don't know how much flu testing is being done. Unknown factors then are the starting price of the COVID-19 test module, whether this demand for non-medical testing I'm predicting will materialize, and how low the cost per test can go. Government could use some of that infinite money to subsidize private enterprise use of mass testing too.",50,1585672095,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsg0li/abbotts_5minute_covid19_test_is_massively/,wallstreetbets,29

fsdv4x,IAMB4TMAN,Puts on strip center retail - DD INSIDE,"Let's go over some basic bear themes during beer virus 2020 for companies. We are buying Puts on companies that exhibit:

\- Uncertainty in revenues during quarantine

\- Potential change in consumer behavior post-beer virus

\- Levered balance sheets 

Introducing: STOR Capital (NYSE: STOR)

STOR Capital is a triple net lease REIT that owns retail strip center real estate across the country. Their top 5 tenants are \[1\]:

1) Fleet Farm - owned by the PE firm KKR, sells hunting gear to lawn goods

2) Art Van Furniture - owned by the PE firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, furniture retailer in the Midwest

3) Bass Pro Shops - Google it, only recognized brand on here IMO

4) Cadence Education - Morgan Stanley-affiliated PE Company; early childhood education

5) CWGS Group (Camping World, Gander Outdoors) - retailer of recreational vehicles &amp; related accessories

\-------------

Basically, all shit. **On top of this their net debt/ebitda is 5.7x** \[1\], which is very high for a REIT. 

Bulls in the stock will scream 'diversification', but I am getting more and more convinced that REIT-type investment vehicles with thousands of properties &amp; thousands of tenants are the new shit MBS. I mean, philosophically, what's the difference?

Management released a letter to shareholders on 3/17 assuring that the Company is financially well-positioned with little to no encumbrances (allows them to raise secured debt for additional liquidity), but I think many other posts went over the dangers rumbling in the MBS market that may dampen the tailwind potential here. \[2\] Also, if they were to exercise these options, what type of signaling are they giving to the market on the pristine, diversified RE portfolio they've been touting for years?

Lastly, if you look at their tenant list you can see that it is mostly comprised of PE-backed companies. STOR claims a 2x rent coverage ratio, or up to \~40% cushion on revenues before rent stops getting paid, but this is pre-interest, pre-servicing of debt. Throw those factors in &amp; I can almost guarantee that the math will point towards dangerous levels of cash burn. Rents are going to be re-negotiated, deferred, or thrown out completely. 

TL;DR: **STOR 5/15 $15P**

fsdmir,livesinadurian,The China Paradigm - or how I learned to love the Coronavirus,"I'm going to begin this by saying first off I believe for China all along has been lying about its coronavirus recovery in order to prop up its image as a bastion of global economic stability. Now before any of you saying no shit - I would like you to 1st consider that the majority of the US government planning is based on what is happening in China and what has happened in China. This is in part what has caused a market rally.

**The Case for Chinese Economic Recovery**

Ignoring the Chinese boosting of economic recovery and a lack of economic impact that the coronavirus has had on the Chinese economy it is important for us to consider the fact that Chinese have always and always will be lying about official statistics in order to bolster their economy and to project an image of importance and greatness upon their populace.

![img](49u7gfupl0q41 ""National Bureau of stats China webpage banner; http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/"")

Energy production in China has not changed much since the virus began. Energy consumption is used as a good measure of Chinese industrial output (in particular because of their large manufacturing industry). If these figures are to be believed, then manufacturing has not been hit as hard as it has been un Europe and the USA. [Official figures show manufacturing rebounding](https://www.ft.com/content/c0eddc35-9bab-44ff-9974-ebfdd8edee6f). However, time and time again throughout history especially recently experts have debunked Chinese claims tickly economically and particularly from [official sources of statistics within China](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/economy/article/2155698/chinas-official-figures-lies-damned-lies-or-just-changing)

&amp;#x200B;

![img](nsbexv16m0q41 ""http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202003/t20200317_1732703.html"")

**Why I believe China is actually fucked**

A good measure of how active the populace is people depend on cars and transport in order to get to work, this is reflected well in the amount of traffic. According to the news in China people have started to get back to work. However by looking at other sources of traffic data which we can show that people are still not leaving their homes.

![img](woc1qyofl0q41 ""Traffic in Wuhan is till at fractions of what it was pre coronavirus. https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/traffic-index/wuhan-traffic"")

Other clues are nitrogen maps which have been produced by satellite remote sensing imagery these ensuring that there is been a shortfall in industrial pollutants output on the Chinese continent And have also shown that there's been little chance of recovery in recent weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](pzyigpedn0q41)

In my humble opinion, China is not out the woods just yet they still have months of recovery and even if I'd have recovered fully economically there is still a demand issue within the global economic system that shifts the burden from supply-side which is predominantly China's main business. I, therefore, postulate that it is still possible that China could be heavily impacted by global recession or global economic slowdown within the next few months.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Whinnie the poo been lying about whinnie the flu, and we are fucked.

As $SPY continues to bounce back, it is heading into the 270 region. 270 is an important area to watch because there are two gaps to fill above, and markets will usually reverse after a gap is filled. The gaps are located at 271 and 274. Also, there is a descending resistance that can be traced back all the way to February... the last time it tested this line was in march. If $SPY can reach the 270 region in these next couple of days their will be a ‚Äúconfluence‚Äù of resistance, meaning their will be a lot of sellers. Sellers who play the gaps in the market, and sellers who play the trend lines. 

Also, if this pullback doesn‚Äôt stop in the 270‚Äôs fucking ban my sped ass

fscd1c,Sharksaurus,Federal Reserve announces temporary FIMA Repo Facility,"[Link to press release](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200331a.htm)

Content:

&gt;The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced the establishment of a temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility) to help support the smooth functioning of financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury market, and thus maintain the supply of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The FIMA Repo Facility will allow FIMA account holders, which consist of central banks and other international monetary authorities with accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to enter into repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve. In these transactions, FIMA account holders temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. It should also serve, along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Reserve has established with other central banks, to help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Federal Reserve provides U.S. dollar-denominated banking services to FIMA account holders in support of Federal Reserve objectives and in recognition of the U.S. dollar's predominant role as an international currency. The FIMA Repo Facility, which adds to the range of services the Federal Reserve provides, will be available beginning April 6 and will continue for at least 6 months.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 31st, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-31-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open Tuesday, the final day of the turbulent first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% on Monday ‚Äî up over 20% from its coronavirus sell-off low hit on March 23 but still off 24.5% from last month‚Äôs record high. The 10-year Treasury yield moved higher early Tuesday but remained around 0.7%. U.S. oil prices were bouncing more than 5% early Tuesday after falling below $20 per barrel to an 18-year low and finishing the New York session just above that level Monday. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in phone call Monday, agreed to talks to stabilize energy markets. China‚Äôs official purchasing managers‚Äô index for March showed an expansion instead of an expected contraction. However, Chinese officials warned against reading too much into the numbers because February‚Äôs outbreak halt was so severe.

*****

&gt; * Wall Street closes the books Tuesday on the worst month since the financial crisis, when the Dow sank 14% in October 2008, and the worst quarter since Q4 1987, a three-month period that included the October ‚ÄúBlack Monday‚Äù stock market crash. The fourth quarter in 1987 saw the Dow plunge 25.3%. This year, heading into the final trading day in March, the Dow was losing more than 12% for the month and nearly 22% for the first quarter as the coronavirus crisis bought the U.S. economy to a virtual halt. The S&amp;P 500 was faring marginally better than the Dow, off 11% in March, the worst since a nearly 17% drop in October 2008. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s 18.7% decline with one day left in the quarter was the worst three-month period since Q4 2008, when the index lost almost 22.6%.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases surged past 788,500 with 37,877 deaths and nearly 160,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. remained the country with the most known cases ‚Äî over 164,600. The U.S. death toll of 3,170 as of Tuesday morning was 139 below fatalities in China, where the outbreak started in December. The most deaths from the virus and the second most infections were in Italy, which saw 11,591 deaths among more than 101,700 cases. Spain has the third most cases at about 88,000 and the second highest death toll at 7,716. China has the fourth most cases at over 82,240 and the third most deaths at 3,309.

*****

&gt; * The USNS Comfort floating hospital ship was docked in New York City after arriving Monday morning with the goal of taking noncoronavirus patients within 24 hours. The arrival of the Comfort attracted crowds, with many seeing the ship as a symbol of hope. But the onlookers also raised questions around social distancing.The Comfort‚Äôs mission was to help take the strain off New York hospitals, which have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. Temporary hospitals have been set up in New York‚Äôs Javits Convention Center and in Central Park. The Comfort‚Äôs sister ship, the USNS Mercy, has been serving noncoronavirus cases in Los Angeles since Sunday.

*****

&gt; * Amazon has fired a New York warehouse worker who organized a strike to demand what he sees as the greater need for coronavirus protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant at the fulfillment center known as JFK8 on the city‚Äôs Staten Island, told CNBC on Monday he was fired to keep him quiet. Amazon said Smalls was fired after he received ‚Äúmultiple warnings‚Äù for violating social distancing guidelines and refusing to remain quarantined after coming into close contact with an associate who tested positive for the virus. The organizers said at least 50 people joined Monday‚Äôs walkout. Amazon said that number was more like 15. The JKF8 facility employs about 4,500 people.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, March 31st, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/31/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-31-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open Tuesday, the final day of the turbulent first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% on Monday ‚Äî up over 20% from its coronavirus sell-off low hit on March 23 but still off 24.5% from last month‚Äôs record high. The 10-year Treasury yield moved higher early Tuesday but remained around 0.7%. U.S. oil prices were bouncing more than 5% early Tuesday after falling below $20 per barrel to an 18-year low and finishing the New York session just above that level Monday. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in phone call Monday, agreed to talks to stabilize energy markets. China‚Äôs official purchasing managers‚Äô index for March showed an expansion instead of an expected contraction. However, Chinese officials warned against reading too much into the numbers because February‚Äôs outbreak halt was so severe.

*****

&gt; * Wall Street closes the books Tuesday on the worst month since the financial crisis, when the Dow sank 14% in October 2008, and the worst quarter since Q4 1987, a three-month period that included the October ‚ÄúBlack Monday‚Äù stock market crash. The fourth quarter in 1987 saw the Dow plunge 25.3%. This year, heading into the final trading day in March, the Dow was losing more than 12% for the month and nearly 22% for the first quarter as the coronavirus crisis bought the U.S. economy to a virtual halt. The S&amp;P 500 was faring marginally better than the Dow, off 11% in March, the worst since a nearly 17% drop in October 2008. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s 18.7% decline with one day left in the quarter was the worst three-month period since Q4 2008, when the index lost almost 22.6%.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases surged past 788,500 with 37,877 deaths and nearly 160,000 recoveries, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The U.S. remained the country with the most known cases ‚Äî over 164,600. The U.S. death toll of 3,170 as of Tuesday morning was 139 below fatalities in China, where the outbreak started in December. The most deaths from the virus and the second most infections were in Italy, which saw 11,591 deaths among more than 101,700 cases. Spain has the third most cases at about 88,000 and the second highest death toll at 7,716. China has the fourth most cases at over 82,240 and the third most deaths at 3,309.

*****

&gt; * The USNS Comfort floating hospital ship was docked in New York City after arriving Monday morning with the goal of taking noncoronavirus patients within 24 hours. The arrival of the Comfort attracted crowds, with many seeing the ship as a symbol of hope. But the onlookers also raised questions around social distancing.The Comfort‚Äôs mission was to help take the strain off New York hospitals, which have been overwhelmed by coronavirus cases. Temporary hospitals have been set up in New York‚Äôs Javits Convention Center and in Central Park. The Comfort‚Äôs sister ship, the USNS Mercy, has been serving noncoronavirus cases in Los Angeles since Sunday.

*****

&gt; * Amazon has fired a New York warehouse worker who organized a strike to demand what he sees as the greater need for coronavirus protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant at the fulfillment center known as JFK8 on the city‚Äôs Staten Island, told CNBC on Monday he was fired to keep him quiet. Amazon said Smalls was fired after he received ‚Äúmultiple warnings‚Äù for violating social distancing guidelines and refusing to remain quarantined after coming into close contact with an associate who tested positive for the virus. The organizers said at least 50 people joined Monday‚Äôs walkout. Amazon said that number was more like 15. The JKF8 facility employs about 4,500 people.

fsbto9,fuzzyblankeet,"The Ballad of Big Dick Vick: Onions, Futures, and the American Dream","Hello, idiots

It's me, Fuzzy. Today, we're taking a short break from your regularly scheduled educational programming to talk about futures contracts, and, more importantly, the **original** autist icon. No, it's not about u/jartek putting up [the big black monolith for you to hoot at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9woRJ7-mD7Y) in 2012. We're turning back the clock for some storytime about why you can trade futures on just about anything in America - other than onions (or receipts on box office returns, but that's a whole other fucking story).  Don't worry, you screeching nerds in the back; I'll explain what futures are along the way.

""Why should I give a shit, Fuzzy?"". Because (i) a little history of markets is good to have in your back pocket (ii) you probably don't know what a futures contract is, so this might do you some good and (iii) we're all fucking bored in quarantine and it's not like either of us have anything better to do. You really think I'd be doing this shit if Opening Day wasn't cancelled and half my clients weren't going fucking tits up like u/controlthenarrative? (seriously - you haven't lived 'til you've seen a CFO 'guh'). Plus, it's a great anecdote to spin the next time the cute barista mixing your decaf rainbow-spinkle frap with extra syrup looks bored enough to listen to you for more than five seconds (or, you know, tell it to your wife's boyfriend, your body pillow - YMMV). I'd actually been saving the full version for u/pokimane. It's that good. But, I'm bored, and I feel sufficiently generous to share it with you now. If you don't care, you can go back to beating your meat to your RH tickers. I can't tell you what to do.

Let's get started.

**Futures For Dummies**

Before I explain how all this works, a little history. Like many great ideas - sushi, Nintendo, used lingerie vending machines - futures originated with the Japs. Some smartass farmers in Osaka in the 1700s started trading rice on credit months in advance of the harvest in order (I assume) to hedge against some rogue samurai coming to take their shit. I don't know, I'm not a fucking historian. Anyway. This idea took off pretty fucking fast once people realized they could use this to both protect against losses and project future prices / demand for the shit they made and soon our tea-drinking cousins in Ye Olde England were doing it for whatever they make there - wool and Wensleydale? Who cares. And then it blew up in Chicago of all places (I guess because there are lots of farmers in the Midwest), and the Mercantile Exchange was born. Shoutout to the Second City (more than just the home of a [murder hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes) and shitty [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs) [teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox)). Today you can trade futures in just about anything but the roots (and most important contracts) are still in commodities.

Anyway. So what is a futures contract, exactly? It's basically like an option contract with a couple of extra features. Like an option, a futures contract is a derivative - an instrument the value of which is **derived** (hence, derivative) from the  price of an underlying asset. As we all hopefully know, options give you a \*right\* - but not an obligation - to buy or sell particular shit at a particular price on a particular date. Futures, on the other hand, \*oblige\* each party to the contract to deliver the goods or cash on the settlement date (depends on the exchange you're trading at - some allow for cash settlement, some don't). What does this mean for the individual trader? Consider the purchase of a naked put/call option. Your potential loss is limited to the premium you paid for each contract in the first place. You buy up front, and you either print tendies or you hold the bag depending on which way the price of the equity moves - red lines or green lines. You don't need to pony anything up on the expiration date if you don't want to.

Futures expose you to a \*much greater\* risk (and reward) than options because you're signing up to deliver X product at $Y no matter what happens to the price of X product in the meantime. See, futures are highly leveraged. Instead of paying RH the $0.01 to buy a $SEAS death put against Ol' Fuzzy's advice, the broker asks you to put up a certain percentage of the contract up front and bear the risk and rewards of the fluctuations yourself over the life of the contract. You only pay a small portion of the price up front - whatever the broker determines is appropriate. It could be 10x or 20x (even 25 or 30x for really weird assets) less than the actual value of the contract. The value of your contract is then marked-to-market on an hourly, daily or weekly basis depending on the asset (this means that the price is adjusted based on the actual value of the underlying asset). As the price of the commodity (say, corn or whatever) fluctuates, your account gets debited or credited with the movement depending on your position on the contract. If it moves in the wrong direction, you need to post additional margin. If it moves in the right direction, you get a credit. You can either hold the contract 'til expiration and cash-settle, settle for the quantity of the actual shit you agreed to buy, or you can create a synthetic settlement early by opening an inverse position and netting the profits. It's up to you.

There's a whole lot more technical shit that goes into it that I'm not going to bother with here. I'm sure some nerd or JV trader will start acting smart in the comments and I'll be forced to flex my mind muscles on you and explain it in more detail. But I'll save that for later because that's not why we're here tonight. We're here to talk about.......

**The Ballad of Big Dick Vick (Or: Why You Can't Trade Onion Futures Anymore)**

Imagine you're some podunk fucking farmer in the 1940s. You know what sucks? Your life. Mildred ain't putting out after your fifth kid died of consumption and everyone you know is either starving to death in the Dust Bowl because shit won't grow (shoutout [James 'OG' Agee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Us_Now_Praise_Famous_Men)) or they're dead fighting Nazis in France. What could possibly get you through the day? Onions. They're cheap, easy to grow, and you can tie 'em on your belt (befitting the style of the time). Onions were so important to the economy at this point in American history that they became the most heavily traded commodity in the country. In fact, onion contracts made up 25% of daily futures volume at the Mercantile Exchange. Truly, they were the meme stock of their time. Amazing, right? Anyway.

Enter Vincent W. Kosuga - Big Dick Vick to his friends (\*may not be a real nickname). Like many of you autists, Vick was fucking poor. He had a failing celery farm and a fat wife, and that was about it. He was also a certified fucking maniac who always carried a gun and flew a home-made plane in his spare time. He was a character and a shitty farmer. But the man had a dream. A dream to make fuck-you money and give it to the Pope (seriously - the 50s were a wild time). So Vick heard about some fucking autist who'd made his fortune trading wheat futures and he figured 'well shit, I can do that'. Spoiler alert: he fucking couldn't. He nearly bankrupted himself - he got so poor that he couldn't even afford to grow celery anymore and all the seeds he could afford to buy were... onions. Yep. Onions.

This was Vick's lightbulb moment. A shitload of onions were grown in his neck of the woods, but in these pre-internet days, there was a time lag between the knowledge of available volume and the market's price, because the market was a long way away from the onions. So he and a pal called Sam (who owned the local grocery store and vegetable supplier) realized by travelling to Chicago themselves, they could use their insider knowledge of onion supply to bet big or short on the prices with an advantage over most other traders. They got pretty fucking rich pretty fucking fast doing this. But for Big Dick Vick, it wasn't enough. The man didn't just want to get rich anymore. He wanted to be the Onion King. So in the fall of 1955, Vick and Sam used their winnings to buy up virtually every long onions future available on the market, and demanded physical settlement, not cash. So far, so simple right. The hook? They **also** bought every short contract. Normally, this would be a recipe for playing yourself. With natural market forces and/or cash settlement, at best you net off with a small profit. But when you control the entire supply of the commodity? You can flood the market and crash the price, and make a fucking killing. And that's exactly what they did. There were fucking onions everywhere in Chicago. They started dumping them in the Chicago River but that clogged it up so they just let them rot in the street. If you've been to Chicago, you know what I'm talking about and that I'm not throwing any shade on your fine town, but it takes a lot to make Chicago smell worse than it already does - and the onions fucking did it. Onions, for a brief time, were literally worth less than the bags they came wrapped in. You could buy 50lbs of onions for a dime. People estimate Big Dick Vick made nearly $100 million off this trade - which was big fucking money in the 50's. But more importantly, Big Dick Vick pulled a big short 50 years before Margot Robbie got wet explaining to you (incorrectly) how CDOs work. I don't know how else to explain this to you - it's the only time in the *history of capitalism* that one man ever successfully cornered a commodity market. Shoutout BDV.

Naturally, the government didn't like this. Neither did other onion farmers - considering Vick bankrupted most of them. They lobbied Congress who set up a Senate Committee into Big Dick Vick's onion monopoly. So what did BDV do? He told a Senate Committee hearing that ""if it's against the law to make money, I'm guilty"". Other than that, he denied all responsibility, and they couldn't do anything about it - he hadn't broken any laws. He cucked the government and all of his competitors in one fell swoop. He cashed his profits, moved home and opened a restaurant called *The Jolly Onion*. He wound up donating most of his cash to the Catholic Church, and he got his wish of meeting the Pope (he actually met three of them over the course of his life). In the meantime, the government didn't want to get cucked by him again, so they passed the [Onion Futures Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/13-1) \- which specifically outlaws trading onion futures, and still exists in law today.

&amp;#x200B;

The new buzz word you'll see spammed in every daily thread by the bears is now ""a death cross has just formed"". A death cross is basically the cross between the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average on the 1D chart. Now, I know what you're thing, TA is bullshit, Muh quad witching. I know, so lets see what happened the past 10 time this happened. Ill refer to the death cross as DC from here on out. 

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **6 december 2018**

After an intial plunge from SPX 2941 to 2604, DC appeared 2 days AFTER the second recovery to the 2800 zone, SPX at 2600-2700 range at moment of appearance. Aftermath:  SPX nosedove to 2340 18 days later with only a single green day in between.

**2. 6 januari 2016**

During a still shaky market closely after DC no 3 (see image below), spy plunged from 2080 to 1920 in just 7 trading days before the DC appeared. After DC market fell further to 1815 over 10 trading days with no significant recovery. After this bottom, market rebounded to 1940 10 days later, retested the bottom another 10 days later, before recovering entirely by mid-april.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. 28 august 2015**

Market plunged from 2100 to 1870 in just 4 trading days. DC appeared on the top of the recovery to 1990 4 days later. market retested the bottom 1 month later but did not drop lower.

**4. 11 august 2011**

Market plunged from 1350 to 1100 over the course of 15 trading days. DC appeared on a recovery day to 1170. Aftermath: market retested low 3 times, bottoming out at 1070 2 months later.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. 2 juli 2010**

The bulls will love this one. Market went down from 1220 to 1020 over 2.5 months before appearance of the DC. Aftermath: it was the bottom, although after a rebound to 1130, a low of 1040 was retested

**6. THE BIG ONE, 20 december 2007 (yes you read that right, 2007! not 2008)**

The market entered a period of shaky trading in late 2007, with a top SPX of 1575 on 10 october 2007. 2 months before and after this top, a dip to 1400 was recrded and the DC appeared at an apparent rebound period at SPX 1485.

fs96od,LordofTurnips,A Random Walk Down Wallstreet Bets,"~~Adapted from a passage in A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel.~~  Written by me.  


**~~Technical and Fundamental Analysis~~** **Autism**  


It follows from the technique that the autist is a trader, not a long term investor. The autist buys when the news looks favourable, and sells on bad omens. He flirts with stocks just as some flirt with the same sex, and his tendies are succesful in and out trades, not boring long term commitments. Indeed, the autists Don D. Jackson author with Albert Haas, Jr., of *Bulls, Bears and Dr. Freud*, suggested that such an individual is playing a game with overt sexual overtones.

When the autist chooses a stock for potential investment, he typically buys options immediately, since for the autist - as in romance and sexual conquest - timing is essential. There is mounting excitement as the stock penetrates the base formation and rises higher. Finally, if the affair has gone well, there is the moment of fulfillment - tendies, and the release and afterglow that follow. The autists vocabulary features such terms as double bottoms, bull gang, stonks go up, firmed up, mooning, quad witching and buying climax. And all this takes place under the pennant of that great symbol of sexuality: the bear.  


**The Rationale for the Autistic Method**  


Probaby the hardest question to answer is: ""Why is autism supposed to work? Some of my best friends are autistic and I have listened very carefully to their explanations, but I haven;t really yet understood them. Indeed, many autists freely admit that they don't know why autism should work - history just has a habit of repeating itself. Even WSBgod, the autist seer, went so far as to say that we can never hope to know ""why"" the market behaves as it does, we can only aspire to understand ""how to make tendies"".",8,1585642987,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs96od/a_random_walk_down_wallstreet_bets/,wallstreetbets,1

fs8hgv,wicn,What part does algo-trading play in all this?,"Yo, if you're looking for some autist providing market analysis or SEA dd's, this is not the post

I get that the feds stimulus bill and unlimited QE are what pumped the market nearly 10% over the past 4 days, but what i don't get is how unresponsive the market has been to crazy headlines like crazy death count predictions, extended shutdowns, overcrowded hospitals, massive unemployment levels, etc. 

The amount of shitty news that's dropped over the past week has outweighed the feds desperate money moves by a long shot, but the market continues to climb. I'm far from being well versed in the technicalities that drive the stock market, but I was surprised to hear that 80% of daily exchanges are done through algo trading. 

Now my question is, even if prices are propped up by the feds unlimited piggy bank, how is the market not reacting to any negative news being priced in if algo's, trading purely off of news and independent stock data, dictate 80% of all daily chart movements. Shouldn't this mean the market will give at least a little when dead boomers roll around on TV? I might just be missing a key factor that'd explain the current market trajectory but right now I feel like i'm missing something. Might also be asking something no one here knows so..

fs86ux,Influencer1980,"üåàüêª's Rather than Spy Puts, why not use üåàüêª Call Spreads?","I know, I know, BAN, since half this sub is about Spy Calls right now. But for those of you who still are betting on a bull trap soon, or even those who may be in the future, why not use Bear call spreads rather than puts? Shit you can even use Bull call spreads if you are long. I'm not an option master, but from what I can determine it seems like much better odds, less risk and more profit potential. 

If you don't know, a Bear call spread is selling a call at/or close to the money and then buying another call out of the money. Here is an example if you were planning to buy a 220 put for end of May or something. I used a further out expiration date, but I will not hold the position past the first week of June to limit my liability.

Position: 

Sell: $255 call Dec 18th x 13

Buy: $305 call Dec 18th x 25

Get up to a $22,000 premium credit or just go even (no premium credit or debit)

For this spread I use a far out expiration date, but will not hold the position past the first week of June to limit liability. As long as you keep strict rules to be out of the position by then, the most you can lose is around $3,000, and that is only if Spy is in the 275-285 range when you close your positions. The overall breakeven or dead zone is the 260-300 range, pretty much anything else is $$$

If Spy does drop to the 220-180 range like you planned for, your profit potential is $12,000-$20,000. On the other hand if for some reason Spy were to Spike to 315-320 in late April/May you would also profit $5,000-$10,000 on the upside as well which is nice.

Like I said I am not an options expert, so anyone feel free to let me know if I am missing something, but based on the analysis I did (and the OPC I attached which helps with the visual), it seems like a no brainer vs. just buying the $220 put.

PROS: (That I see)

A) No cost up front, can even take a premium credit if you want.

B) No time decay, you profit under 260 the full way rather than stair stepping down and needing to be under 215 by the end of the put. For example 240 end of April, bear spread is +5,000 and put is -1,000

C) Using the same risk amount (May 15th $220p x 5 = $3,355), your profit potential is actually more on the spread at the 220-180 target zone, actually close to double if hits target zone in late April/May.

D) If for any reason it goes against you and pumps to the upside you have the possibility of actually making some money from your OTM call vs. losing your full premium on the put.

CONS: (That I can see)

A) If you don't stick to your late May/early June position close rule and try to run it out because it's negative at the time, you have the potential to lose a LOT more (up to -$40,000 in the middle of the dead zone at expiration). 

B) If for some reason your brokerage platform doesn't allow you to write calls. I had to get approved for level 4 options to be able to. 

C) If Spy were to tank to 150, with the put you would make a bit more profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok that't it, I will attach a couple screen shots of the positions on OPC. Just figured I would share this technique with guys that didn't know about it to try to help out, and also hear back about anything I may be missing or could do differently for any reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Consider using a Bear call spread rather than just a long put. More potential and less risk if you use a further expiration but set a strict rule on when you will end the position regardless if in the negative.

fs7sdh,wickedsight,Why stonks are up. Another theory.,"So, I just thought of another reason why markets might be going up right now  and it consistes of 2 parts:

\- Wage cuts

\- Lay-offs

Donald and The Fed (DTF) are giving major corporations a bunch of money in order for them to not die. When we heard all this, we figured ""that ain't a good sign"" and bought puts. One of the demands from DTF is ""no buy backs, dividend or bonuses until it's paid back"", or something along those lines. Yet again, we thought that's not good, so we got more puts. The, here, problem is that we don't think like the sadistic bull chads of Wall Street.

spew some bull-shit about loyaltnd getting through this together.

When all of this is done, these companies will work as hard as they can to pay back those loans ASAP. They can't even hand out bonuses, so that helps too. Once the loans are paid back, the limitations will be gone and then everyone (who owns stock) will be happy. Dividends will be paid out again and will be higher due to lower overhead, management will get massive bonuses because they handled everything so well and got the company through the downturn and stocks will moon because of all this,

Meanwhile we're all just fucked because our puts expired worthless or we got fired or a pay cut. But at least the stonks are up, right?",35,1585635669,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs7sdh/why_stonks_are_up_another_theory/,wallstreetbets,1

fs7k51,bewbs_and_stuff,Subprime Auto Lending Bubble,"There's been a subprime auto lending bubble, ready to burst, for the past 2 years. 'Contract workers' took out loans to purchase cars and 'work' for companies like 'Uber' and 'lyft'. On December 12th of 2019, NPR covered a story about a guy who purchased a 2015 Chrysler for $10k hoping to use that vehicle to earn himself ""$1,500 to $2,000 per week"" in income. The guy in the NPR story (presumably the norm) used a company called ""Credit Acceptance"" ($CCACC) to finance the purchase. So, this guy finds out he agreed to a sale price of $17k with a subprime interest rate of 22.99%. Ipso facto, he agreed to pay $32k paid for a $10k car. Low and behold, the lender ""Credit Acceptance"" also functions as a collections agency. Therefore, this lender reserves the right to repossess the car and recover the deficiency amount. However, since 2019 the New York Legal Assistance Group has been defending consumers from such debtors on grounds of false advertising, deception, fraud, and violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act.

Because look at the people who are actually in charge of the markets and currency and shit. They turn a blind eye to blatant corruption and manipulation. They break the currency with hyper inflation. They bail out their friends instead of the population and give a surprised Pikachu face when it devalues their own money. They make investments that trend well for a decade, then beg for handouts when it takes a sharp loss.

I learned 2 things from those experiences.

1) I am, and nearly everyone else is, an idiot.

2) You're never purchasing the return but the assumptions the return is based on.

If you're assuming ""unlimited QE"" means ""Fed purchases corporate bonds &amp; equities forever"", then your assumption is wrong.

If your assumption is that corporate America is safe from a massive equity disaster because the Fed is backstopping their (IG) debt, your assumption is wrong. What leverage does a bondholder have over such an issuer?

If your assumption is that an $SPY level of ""good times circa early 2019"" is sustainable by QE come summer when the defaults start rolling up from the bottom, then you may be right, but not forever.

Step 2a: If the post is some sort of retarded DD  but does not include a strike and expiry, simply comment ‚Äústrike and expiry retard‚Äù or some other phrase that lets OP know he is a retard and should‚Äôve included a strike and date. This is good for a few meager upvotes.

Step 2b: If the post is long as fuck, like this one, and does not include a TLDR. Just comment something abt not knowing how to read OR refer to 2c. Your comment can be anything as long as it gets the point across. For example, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to read but I think this means my puts are going to print.‚Äù

Step 2c: If OP posts something truly incredibly retarded just say ‚Äúban‚Äù. This happens a lot, so make sure you differentiate yourself from the other ban comments by saying something stupid like ‚Äúthis makes my dick hard; ban‚Äù

Step 2d: If you are feeling low effort and are super early to a post just comment ‚Äúsir this is a ‚Äú(insert random chain establishment)‚Äù. I don‚Äôt particularly  like these comments but they tend to garner a few upvotes if done correctly. 

Step 2e: If you see a post that physically manifests cancer within you, just comment ‚Äúgtfo‚Äù, ‚Äúban‚Äù, ‚Äúmods‚Äù, ‚Äúthis post gave me autism‚Äù or any other similar phrase. There is some standard here at WSB. 

Step 2f: If the post is just fishing for confirmation of
a position that you also have, make sure to call OP a cuck but also thank him for sharing his retardation with you and likely many others. Also don‚Äôt forget to give him an upvote. An example of this could be ‚Äúthis post is retarded however I have the same position as you, therefore I upvote‚Äù

Step 2g: If it‚Äôs a gains or loss post that is not on robinhood just say some dumb shit about not understanding the interface. If it is on robinhood either congratulate the retard for his loss or tell him to fuck off for actually making money

Step 2h: If you are really stuck just comment something about Jpow, printer, brrrrr, üêªüåà, diamond hands, drill team 6, SPY puts, autism, priced in, ban, or ,if you are really feeling frisky, actual commentary that helps further the conversation.

Step 3: Remember, everyone here is a retard just like you, so just comment funny shit that makes us all feel a little less dead inside from our red all times.

fs722a,Tirikemen,"Primer on the oil and gas industry, demand destruction and the price war","**TL;DR Oil demand may fall by as much as 20 million barrels a day this year, which is insane. The price war is leading to oversupply and probably won‚Äôt end soon. So you have a demand shock and a supply shock creating a perfect shit storm. It is not impossible for oil to fall into the single digits. There will be blood.**

Just to get it out of the way: SPY $200p 4/24 and F $4p 4/17. I know, I‚Äôm a fucking idiot.

I‚Äôve been getting questions about oil trickling in since /u/fuzzyblankeet started writing his outstanding corporate debt threads and I wrote about it in one of them, so I figured I would give you guys a (short, but terribly long for you autists) primer on the oil and gas industry, demand destruction and the price war. TL;DR‚Äôs will be provided in sections for the lazy or can‚Äôt be bothered.

I‚Äôm not giving you trades because 1) you need to do your own DD on specific companies (I briefly looked at finances for Oxy and Devon in fuzzy‚Äôs first thread if you want to go find that); fuzzy‚Äôs suggestions are a good place to start, particularly for US shale companies 2) I‚Äôm not an experienced options trader and you don‚Äôt need me giving you full-retard plays. 

As far as my background, my full-time job involves covering the news in the sector for an industry-specific data and analytics company. You have to pay more than pocket change to read my good stuff, but I'm several orders of magnitude less expensive than fuzzy. I mainly cover the Canadian and international upstream markets, but I have dabbled in the rest of it, including capital markets, and I understand the broad strokes of US shale.

**Definitions**

**TL;DR If you know nothing of the oil and gas industry, you may need a bit of a down-and-dirty glossary to get started. I wrote this first, so I may not use all the terms listed (and I certainly didn‚Äôt list all the terms there are), but they are good to know anyways. Skip if you have at least a passing familiarity with the industry.** 

¬∑ Upstream ‚Äì Essentially exploration and production. These are the companies (or divisions of supermajors) that find the oil and gas and pull it out of the ground.

¬∑ Midstream ‚Äì Transportation and storage. Moving produced oil and gas by pipeline, truck, ship, railcar, etc. and when needed, storing them.

¬∑ Downstream ‚Äì Refineries and plants. These are the guys that turn unprocessed crude and gas into end-use or intermediate products.

¬∑ Oilfield Services ‚Äì These are the companies that help upstream companies get their shit. They may shoot seismic to help find prospects, run land or offshore rigs to drill wells, build infrastructure, provide drilling fluids or other chemicals, and a whole host of other shit. 

¬∑ Conventional ‚Äì These wells are the traditional image of how oil and gas gets produced. You drill a well (mostly) straight down and you find a pocket of oil and/or gas or you don‚Äôt. Good rock with high permeability and porosity. Most offshore production is conventional. It also typically has lower decline rates.

¬∑ Unconventional ‚Äì This is essentially shale. Tight rock with low permeability and porosity. You drill down to the rock and then drill a lateral section, so you have as much pipe in the pay zone as possible. Then you use that evil fracking shit to break the rock up so oil and gas flow. These wells are often comparatively more expensive to drill, and the output declines quickly, so you have to constantly drill new wells if you want to maintain or grow production. Unconventional shale is what led to the US boom in production in recent years.

¬∑ Oilsands ‚Äì Canada. This can either be mined to produce bitumen or extracted through things like steam-assisted gravity drainage (pump steam into ground to heat up the bitumen and make it less viscous). It has to be blended with diluent (very light oil or condensates) to move in pipelines and is processed into synthetic crude.

¬∑ Light vs Heavy oil ‚Äì API gravity says how light or heavy oil is. High API is lighter, low API is heavier. One isn‚Äôt necessarily better than the other, they have different uses. For example, heavy oil makes better fuel oil for ships. Sometimes oil can have high sulfur content, which is expensive but necessary to remove. ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù oil means low sulfur content. WTI and Brent are light crudes, a lot of Middle Eastern, Canadian and Venezuelan oil (as examples) is heavy.

¬∑ Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids ‚Äì C2-C5+ (ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, etc.) found in some gas fields. Exist as liquids at ambient temperatures and often more valuable than the gas itself. 

¬∑ Gas ‚Äì Natural gas, not gasoline. Most oil fields have associated gas production, which may be flared (burned off) or reinjected into the reservoir to enhance recovery (keeps pressures higher so production doesn‚Äôt decline as fast). 

¬∑ LNG ‚Äì Liquefied Natural Gas. If you‚Äôre exporting gas overseas and can't use a pipeline, you send it to a terminal that makes it really fucking cold to liquefy it and then send it to export markets by ship, where it is turned back into gas.

¬∑ OPEC and OPEC+ - You all should have heard of the OPEC cartel, but OPEC+ was a group of non-member countries (Russia chief among them) that worked with OPEC to protect oil prices by reducing their output. That ended early in March and led to the price war.

¬∑ NOCs ‚Äì National Oil Companies. Most producing countries have a state-owned oil company that will typically control large portions of the country‚Äôs reserves or all of it; sometimes there are a few state-owned companies in one country. They‚Äôll also partner in assets outside of their country. Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia, Rosneft and Gazprom in Russia, Petrobras in Brazil, ONGC in India, Equinor in Norway, etc. The US, obviously, does not have a NOC. Not all NOCs are created equal. Pemex, Mexico‚Äôs NOC, is a steaming pile of shit and the one of the most indebted companies in the world.

¬∑ Supermajors ‚Äì There are five: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total. Huge, valuable companies that have been around forever and will probably be around until the Sun swallows the Earth or we all kill each other. Even after we transition away from hydrocarbons as our energy source, these behemoths will adapt and endure.

**Industry Background**

**TL;DR Very brief history, skip if you don‚Äôt care**

The oil and gas industry has always been more boom and bust than a lot of other sectors. The world wants exactly as much petroleum as it wants and not a drop more. When supply does not match demand, prices fluctuate widely. OPEC (essentially led by Saudi Arabia) was formed in 1960 and as of 2018, its 14 member countries control nearly half of global production and over three-quarters of proven reserves. Since the 1980s, the organization began setting production targets to protect oil prices and market share. This has led to a series of price wars, with the previous occurring in 2014-2016.

US oil production peaked in the 1970s and had been in steady decline until about 2009, when the shale revolution began. The early days were the wild west, with small independents springing up like weeds and spending years and billions focused on growth over returns. Oil output climbed to 8-9 MMbo/d in 2014 and was over 12 MMbo last year, making the US the largest producer in the world. 

The price war in 2014 began when Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to protect market share by allowing themselves to exceed their production quotas. The goal of the price war was to reign in US shale. US output fell from a peak of 9.5 MMbo/d to a low of 8.5 MMbo/d. However, companies were backstopped by an inflow of new capital from lenders, private equity and others under the promise of future returns. Oil prices dipped into the high $20/bbl range before the end of the war. The price war was ultimately abandoned by Saudi Arabia after King Salman was warned that the country would be bankrupt within three to four years if it continued and major economic reforms weren't implemented.

In the years since the 2014-2016 price war, consolidation has begun in the US shale patch. New capital is harder to come by and investors have shifted focus from continued growth to positive cash flow and returns. Smaller or over-levered companies have started folding or been bought out by larger, stronger competitors, including supermajors.

In order to curb oversupply issues and protect prices, OPEC+ (OPEC, Russia and ten other non-members) began curtailing production in 2017. Those original cuts have been extended and expanded multiple times, all the way through March 2020. The current cuts that expire Wednesday amount to 1.7 MMbo/d, or 2.1 MMbo/d when including voluntary reductions from Saudi Arabia.

**Demand Destruction: Who needs oil when you are knocking back a cold bottle of beer flu**

**TL;DR Oil demand could fall by 20 MMbo/d YOY at the peak. Bad for prices.**

Covid-19 threw a wrench into oil markets, which should be painfully obvious. Industrial production in China‚Äîone of Russia and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs primary customers‚Äîfell off a cliff. China is the largest energy consumer in the world and accounted for over 80% of global oil demand growth last year. Demand for transport fuels has also been pummeled with 3 billion people on lockdown and fewer goods moving around. As an example of how important that is, 70% of US petroleum consumption, or 14 MMbo/d, is used for transportation. Petroleum is also used for hundreds of intermediate and end-use products such as plastics, polyurethane and solvents, which aren't being made. Power generation is also important, but a fairly small slice of the pie, and I don‚Äôt have time to get into electrical grids, baseload power and everything else it involves.

In early March, the IEA estimated oil demand this year would fall by 90,000 bo/d from 2019 to a total of about 100 MMbo/d, compared to its previous estimate of 825,000 bo/d of growth. This forecast was based on an assumption of 2.5 MMbo/d less demand in Q1 with a gradual rebound the rest of the year. At the time, its best case scenario was that oil demand would grow by 480,000 bo/d. In the worst case, demand would fall by 730,000 bo/d. 

This was pretty bad, but far too rosy an outlook. Since then, numerous analysts have projected declines in demand ranging from 7 to 10 MMbo in Q2. Goldman Sachs and Vitol (world‚Äôs largest independent oil trader) estimate oil demand could fall by 15-20 MMbo/d YOY at its peak. The IEA has since said much the same thing. Even if the price war ended tomorrow, it would be too late to avoid an oversupply issue, which I‚Äôll talk about later.

**Price War: ‚ÄúFuck US Shale‚Äù -Putin probably, but in Russian**

**TL;DR Saudi Arabia and Russia are fighting for market share, with the added benefit of knee-capping US Shale. Oversupply could be several million barrels per day. Both of them are equipped to draw this out. Even worse for prices.**

Saudi Arabia and OPEC knew how bad the pandemic was going to be for oil prices, so they sought to extend and expand production cuts again in late February and early March. The cuts would have taken another 1.5 MMbo/d off the markets through 2020, for a total of 3.6 MMbo/d. The proposal required the approval of OPEC+ (mainly Russia), as the non-members would have been responsible for 500,000 bo/d of the cuts.

Russia, as we all know, did not agree to the cuts. Their argument was that any production cuts were quickly replaced by growth in US shale oil production. Which is true, we‚Äôve added about 3 MMbo/d in the three years that OPEC+ has cut production by, at most, 2.1 MMbo/d. There have been reports that new sanctions against Rosneft regarding commercial relations with Venezuela were what ultimately caused Putin to tell his energy minister to reject the cuts.

Saudi Arabia responded quickly. Russia rejected the deal on March 6, and by March 8 the Saudis cut their official selling prices and kicked off the war, leading to the March 9 oil route. In a bid to recover market share they lost in the previous war, Saudi Arabia cut prices for their flagship Arab Light crude by $8/bbl for northwest Europe in April‚Äîdirectly challenging Russia‚Äîsetting a discount of $10.25/bbl under Brent, compared to a $2/bbl discount for Russia‚Äôs Urals blend. The Saudis also reduced their prices to Asia and the US by $6-7/bbl.

Beyond prices, Saudi Arabia promised to increase production to 10 MMbo/d from their current 9.7 MMbo/d, once the existing OPEC+ production cuts fell off on April 1. Since then, they have doubled down and said they would increase production to 12.3 MMbo/d and begin increasing capacity to 13 MMbo/d. Now, it is estimated that 12 MMbo/d is the Saudi‚Äôs current production capacity, meaning they would have to dip into their stored reserves and couldn‚Äôt maintain 12.3 forever.

The UAE, primarily Abu Dhabi‚Äôs ADNOC, said they would increase production by 1 MMbo/d. Russia promised to increase their production by 300,000 bo/d. The other 12 members of OPEC and 10 non-member countries of OPEC+ also have no reason to hold back anymore. This won‚Äôt happen overnight on April 1, but you still have promises to add something like 3.5-4 MMbo/d to a market that doesn‚Äôt need it, which is a nightmare in the best of times.

Unlike previous price wars, which were started by Saudi Arabia to protect market share, Russia started this one for geopolitical and economic reasons. Putin pulled the trigger, and he is obviously not some replaceable energy minister, so this will go on as long as he wants or until everyone else capitulates. Russia is also far less reliant on oil revenue than Saudi Arabia. 

According to the IMF, Russia needs $42/bbl to balance its budget, compared to $82/bbl for the Saudis. Oil and gas revenue account for 1/3 of Russia‚Äôs budget and about half its exports, compared to 80% and 2/3 for Saudi Arabia. Russia has also said it could withstand $25-30/bbl for 6-10 years (remember SA ended the 2014-16 war because they were going to be bankrupt in 3-4). Saudi Arabia‚Äôs advantage is that they have the cheapest production costs in the world, at $2.80/bbl. Their budget requires $82/bbl because they are using the revenues to try to diversify their economy, which they can also put on the back burner.

To quote analyst Vincent Lauerman, ‚ÄúIf oil consumption was to decline by a conservative 2.5 million bbls/d this year, oil production by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Russia was to increase by 2.57 million bbls/d on an annualized basis, and given the initial 1.65 million bbls/d surplus forecasted by OPEC, global oil supply would exceed consumption by an insane 7.88 million bbls/d in 2020. In the heart of the previous three oil price wars, global oil supply exceeded consumption by no more than 1.76 million bbls/d, in 1998.‚Äù

He went on to say that the surplus won‚Äôt be that high, for several reasons, which will be explained next. But it‚Äôs a good summation of how impactful a price war during a pandemic is.

**Impacts on Industry: We‚Äôre all fucked (by popular request)**

**TL;DR WTI oil prices could fall to $10/bbl or even single digits. Shale companies are fucked, OFS companies are fucked, downstream companies may be fucked. Midstream companies may actually be ok.**

The most obvious impact are oil prices. WTI briefly hit its lowest price since 2002 once already since March 9 and again today, when it fell below $20/bbl. WCS (Canadian benchmark) costs less to buy‚Äîabout $8-9/bbl‚Äîthan it does to ship it. I won‚Äôt spend much time on Canada, they‚Äôve been fucked since 2016 as they don‚Äôt have enough takeaway capacity and too much regulatory uncertainty, and now they‚Äôre just a gaping, bloody mess. But the prices aren‚Äôt stopping here. With the massive oversupply that is coming and limited storage, many analysts are forecasting prices as low as $10/bbl or even single digits if the price war and pandemic are drawn out.

Several US shale basins were marginally economic to begin with (remember unconventional wells are expensive), and with prices falling so far they are entirely uneconomic. Almost every company, although not all of them, have cut capital expenditures (and sometimes dividends and executive/employee pay) to reduce their cash outflows. Remember, new capital saved shale in the last war, but it isn‚Äôt happening this time. Shale is no longer in the good graces of lenders it enjoyed in previous years. 

The companies will be able to prop up production for a while with DUC inventories, which are wells that were drilled but uncompleted, meaning they can be brought on stream for relatively small amounts of capex. But eventually those will run out, and uneconomic production will be shut in regardless. Russia (Putin) is actually likely to get what they want, at least for a while, as independent producers in the US who don‚Äôt have the state backing of a NOC will let production decline to try to survive.

Many producers, including US shale companies, have been hedging their production in recent years to protect against low oil prices. Many of them also used three-way collars to do it. An example of a three-way collar would be buying a put at $45/bbl, then selling a call at $55/bbl and another put at $35/bbl to offset premiums. They‚Äôre fine between $45-$55‚Äîor whatever they expected oil's price range to be‚Äîand protected from $35-$45, but once it falls below that, the put they sold wipes out any gains from the one they bought and then some. Some, like Devon, used costless collars and swaps to hedge, so their positions will be fine (Devon‚Äôs position is worth about $800MM right now). And a few, like Continental, didn‚Äôt hedge at all, so they get to take $20 or $10/bbl right in the nuts.

Storage is also finite and quickly running out, which is and will further depress prices. The Texas Railroad Commission (regulates O&amp;G in Texas) said some pipeline operators have issued warnings to producers to reduce production because storage is filling up. Midstream companies, I think, will actually weather this storm fairly well. Pipelines are typically anchored by long-term firm service (take-or-pay) contracts, and as storage becomes more scarce it becomes more expensive. Enbridge, a Canadian midstream company that is North America‚Äôs largest, has already said it is in a strong position to get through this.

Oilfield services companies are particularly vulnerable. Unlike producers and midstream companies, their product is their work. If they don‚Äôt have work, they don‚Äôt have cash flow, whereas the others can sit on their thumbs and the oil and gas provides cash flow. Halliburton has reduced hours for 3,500 employees in Houston, as an example. And Aker Solutions and some other OFS companies that operate in the North Sea have issued layoff warnings to all of their employees and sent foreign contractors home. Downstream companies are also being affected, as refineries are preparing for run cuts (falling demand, no one wants what they are selling) and slowing deliveries (they‚Äôre onsite storage is running out too). 

Once all this blows over, oil and gas will recover. Again, it won‚Äôt be overnight. Production will have to be cut across the industry until demand recovers (probably next year will be ok). They will have to wait for storage levels to fall too before prices will recover fully. There will be bankruptcies during and a wave of consolidation after.

As an aside, the adminstration‚Äôs promise to buy 77 MMbo for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a crock of shit. The SPR is already 90% full, and 77 MMbo, if they can even buy that much, is a drop in the proverbial bucket. It would accomplish nothing and will not protect oil prices or US companies at all.

**So what do we do with this asshole?**

**TL;DR I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm a dumbass and I only know about oil and gas, but I can‚Äôt directly participate in energy markets. Figure it out for yourself.**

Again, I‚Äôm not doing DD for you on specific companies, that‚Äôs on you. As I said before, /u/fuzzyblankeet threads are a good place to start, and I did talk about Devon and Oxy a bit in his first thread. A lot of US shale companies have debt up to their eyeballs, much of it bad. I‚Äôm restricted by my company from participating directly in energy markets, so I haven‚Äôt looked as closely at companies as I have in other sectors, other than for those I‚Äôm writing about for work (and 75% of what I write is focused specifically on E&amp;P operations).

It should already be priced in, but I think there may be some more movement on April 1 when the OPEC+ cuts fall off and a deal hasn‚Äôt been reached (they aren‚Äôt even talking, it‚Äôs not going to happen). Saudi Arabia can turn on the taps quickly from 9.7 MMbo/d, as their current production capacity is estimated at 12 MMbo/d, but by and large the increases in output will take weeks or months to materialize. This will be offset to some extent by falling production among independent producers all over the world, but it won‚Äôt be enough.

Upstream US company stocks are sure to go lower, especially if WTI goes to $10/bbl or below, and some of them will go bankrupt. Might be a good opportunity to buy in for them sweet dividends (when they come back), but also carries a risk.

fs6wbv,astromickeymouse,The Official Given Numbers Are WRONG COVID-19,"Ok hear me out fellow üåàüêª. I'm not the best in options decision but I know my science. The death rate number given by WHO is not demonstrative of whats happening right now The death rate is at least 4 times higher than what they say. You believe when Trumpy say everything is under control ? WRONG! On march 3 WHO declared the death ratio to be at [3.4%](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020) and its true if you calculate the ratio of number of death by the number of case on that same day. 

On march 3 they're were **93016 case confirmed** and **3202 death** that brings the death ratio to about 3,44%. BUT ITS WRONG ! Nobody dies of the beer flu the same day they gets it. I searched and didn't find anything relevant but my guess is that people die about 21 days after being infected. If thats true we are truly fucked. I read some post here that already said that the death ratio was not calculated correctly so I did it myself. 

HERE HOW IT IS CALCULATED

death (x) / number of case (y) 

HERE HOW IT SHOULD BE CALCULATED

death (x) / number of case (y) - time to die (T)

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is a table I made with the correct percentage of death if it take 21 / 14 / 10 / 7 days to die (T). Those numbers are world-widely but I'm sure America is worst than that.

&amp;#x200B;

[COVID-19 Cases](https://preview.redd.it/t3ukt5dnvxp41.png?width=1700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=032ecc48a8f7dc43c30249e21cf51fd8cca23556)

For all the autism here that are scared by that shit load of number just check the two red circle I draw on there. The first one is my false calculation of the death rate which is  the official number published by WHO on march 3. The second circle is the death rate calculated as of march 30 with the correct way of calculating this thing. The other red number is the false death rate calculation of march 30

&amp;#x200B;

So the if the averages of days to die is about 13 days wich is very optimistic in terms of that kind of data because the lower (T) is the lower the percentage it will be. The death rate of COVID-19 is **19,36%** about **4 times more what is currently told**. 

Now the question is when government will realize that? I dont't know and maybe never.

Holy fuck we've hit bottom! But then reality hits you: we really we are only at the same point now as we were when Trump took office. Trump literally caused the market to almost double in less than 4 years.. Unreal and unheard of. None of you human parrots could have expected that when you were trying to hike an advanced trail with your girlfriend who you were also trying to impress. Oh yes, I remember when this sub liked to suck their own jizz with random posts about how the ""Trump bump"" didn't actually exist, and how we were all *actually* losing money during his presidency. All the while he's making people (not you) rich, destroying expectations. 

What did you expect?

Others of you say ""we've hit bottom,"" stimulus successful. New great way to invest is take a winning contrarian perspective to /r/wallstreetbets, which is extremely bearish. Take it up the ass you fucking homosexual morons.

I got news for you: The fat cats want you dead. They can manipulate the market far longer than you can stay solvent.

What you all don't get is that as long as the stock market entices green ass babies like you, who profess that the market's going to tank, and swear on your mother's grave we are amidst an apocalypse for which it's only a matter of time before your options print money like the fed is already doing, in the same sentence as you're asking your mom to make you a certain type of meatloaf, keeps changing. ""Hold the line,"" we're fucked. It's all a bunch of bullshit, they will take everything that you're worth. What you don't get is as soon as you fuckers stop chanting this bullshit, there might still be a way for you to get your tendies. Way, way, way far in the future, when you actually secure a job that pays you enough to play this game with the big dogs.

fs6now,arzt506,Put holder getting bled the fuck out? Just try this one thing,"All the noob put holders buying IVs of 300% and puts at the bottom when VIX implying daily moves of 5%. LMAO. If you think that shit can go on for forever you deserve to have your money taken from you. 

We're in some interesting fucking times. Implied daily moves in VIX dropping like your left testicle when pastor Jimmy started tugging on it with a clothes hanger in conversion class last year. Implied daily moves down to about 3% today. That might be sustainable that might not be. If you look at previously high vol periods it's very possible VIX could slow drift down from here even with SPX in % decline, absolutely crushing your puts, even though you were directionally correct.

It's a weird ass fucking position but this is like the one time in a long time where it not be unimaginably gay to hedge vega losses on your long OTM puts with the delta from long VIX puts. Do it. Make pastor Jimmy proud - even though he's looking down on you from his corona filled sex predator jail cell secretly hoping you'll still be gay when he gets out.

If we get more sustained panic selling and HF liquidations then your puts might print and your hedge expires worthless and that's just dandy.

Like the markets down under ASX ( probably down still because of the fires or some shit ), NIKKEI ( No Olympics is good for their economy ), LSE ( Virus is almost over, np they good ), and AfricaTrader ( in perfect health, no death numbers on CV ). 

All these markets open before NYSE and just about always predict which way the markets will go for us good ol red blooded Americans.

We've had the greatest run on guns and ammo and non-perishable food in the history of the United States  (before most of the gun shops were forcibly closed for quarantine).  Medical supplies will almost certainly run out, leaving salvageable people drowning in their own breath and dying preventable deaths due to those shortages (as has happened in Wuhan, Italy, Spain and Iran).

[SPY 30 day chart with RSI and resistance levels.](https://i.imgur.com/O2GUWLb.png)

*NOTE: all these levels and shit are completely based on intuition. Basically when we look for these levels, we are just looking for patterns in the stock movements, areas where it met resistance. Why does it do that? Nobody can fucking say.*

There's a few key things to notice here. First of all the RSI. Right now our RSI level is getting a bit high, but it's not astronomical. We are around 61 RSI right now. Take a look at 5 fridays ago when the RSI dipped below 30, then what happened? SPY shot up past 300 again. Most of you didn't fucking care as much back then because you were still praying for your MSFT $200 3/20 calls. But now that you are leveraged to the tits in SPY $200 4/17, you are a lot more sensitive to these drops.

You can see some other points where RSI dips below 30, and again the market spikes up, but there was a lot of volatility earlier in the month, so shit was way more erratic. Now things are slowing down, and while the situation with the virus isn't good, it isn't completely unknown either. We can start creating new pricing models and forecasts, even if those forecasts mean 2,000,000 baristas are out of a job for a few months. So our RSI level right now, rising but not crazy. We are probably due for a drop in the next **1-2 weeks**. I know that's not what most of you want to hear, and it will probably come sooner, but you should be prepared for that.

Now once it drops, what to expect?
(SPY 14 day view)[https://i.imgur.com/0UorBCT.png]

As you may have noticed, JPow's printer can print hard, but it is having some trouble. It seems to be stuck at 260. Where else have we seen this? About 2 weeks ago we were dancing around the 260 line as well, having a lot of trouble breaking through. But there was a lot more downward pressure back then, but there was still resistance. (You should fully expect that even this was the Fed and other market forces attempting to slow the drop.) But the virus prevailed and all you tendie counting autists got to collect your puts. 

After that we danced around 238, 228, and then finally went to the low of 218. While that is the bottom that we touched, i don't think that is the resistance level, i think that is closer to 220.

At this point, we are seeing a lot of sideways movement around 260, which is a good sign for you put holders. Given the gap down from 275 to 260 on the way down, we don't have any other known resistance between those two points. This means that if we break out of 260 on the way up, you should expect the next stop to be 275.

One more thing, looking at the gaps between afterhours trading
[SPY 15 Day Chart](https://i.imgur.com/T6wJoLK.png)

You can see on the way down we had a lot of days opening significantly lower than the previous days due to a lot of action happening after hours. Similarly on the way up, you can see a lot of opening higher than the previous day. So *what to look for here* once the market starts gapping down, or we have one day that closes low, I'd expect the downward leg to start. I'd expect that leg to try to test 240. And then possibly 228.",41,1585625022,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs5guf/spy_rises_and_you_or_how_long_do_i_need_to_wait/,wallstreetbets,1
fs5ga0,pancak3d,Priced out,"Every imaginable piece of news that has happened already and will ever happen is priced in. This presents a challenge for us. If everything is priced in, there are no option plays that will print.

We need a new paradigm. Since everything is priced in, we need to start identifying news items that are priced out. This means the news was once priced in, but because everyone has forgotten about it and priced in newer news, the old news has been priced out.

Example. Cruises. Every cruise line is megafucked, boats are either empty or quanantined breeding grounds for beervirus. This is priced in, so CCL is going whatever way it logically shouldn't. But what's priced out? Glaciers. Fucking glaciers. Everyone has forgotten about them. Does the Titanic ring any bells? Surprise motherfuckers, glaciers haven't gone anywhere. And who is sucking from the sweet teat of Big Glacier while we all are focused on CCL? 

That's right. Nestle. Nobody here has even questioned how and why Nestle has barely been nudged by this global pandemic. They are nearly at ATH. And they're going higher

My opinion: You can't keep everyone home forever (whether it's due to a lockdown at first or because ppl are terrified later) before there's some kind of inflation of something because at some point someone has to make and deliver the shit the quarantined consume, etc.

So, eventually the inflaton will manifest in wages for exposed workers going way up because there's not enough of them otherwise. Wages especially way up for skilled exposed workers like doctors. Then all goods and services that require such costs go up. You'd see garbage men making more than computer programmers, for example. You'd see psychiatry being cheap and Jimmy John's delivery being expensive.

fs47ha,InHaUse,Thoughts on Inverse Leveraged ETFs?,"Hey guys,

Now I know the basics that due to compounding and other factors holding inverse leveraged ETFs for the long term is bad, but here me out.

Most of these ETFs (like the SPUX) are at historic lows so there isn't much more to lose, but even if they go down to $1.00 in the next couple of months, would it even matter if in a year or more they are over $1,000?

This is assuming we get a short term ""bull"" market, but then we enter into what should be into something much worse than 2008.

So does anyone have any experience with these? I kind of find it hard to believe how back in the last crisis most of there leveraged instruments were trading above $1K a pop and now they're under $100.

They seems much less riskier than options because you technically have infinite time.

fs3rja,LobotomyJesus,Consider the Bullish Case,"1. China is back to work, and even if they need to undergo further quarantines, they've proven their effectiveness. If you recall back to 2015, one of the massive drivers a fear was a slowdown in China. A Chinese slowdown is arguably worse than a US slowdown as China: a) makes everyone's shit, and b) is one of the fastest growing consumers of shit. This leads me to point 2.

2. Outside of a handful of industries, the US economy will be largely unscathed. We're a consumer economy, and we consume best from home. The growing majority of business is handled digitally or in such a way that human interaction is extremely limited. We order goods online, food through our phones, and entertainment literally anywhere now that everything's digital. The 1 year hit that airliners and ""physical"" entertainment will take is negligible in the grand scheme.

3. The people becoming unemployed (get ready for a real redpill) are not the important contributors to the economy. These people almost entirely live paycheck to paycheck and weren't spending much outside of necessary spending. The white collar workers will keep working -- albeit from home -- and continue being, frankly, the main-by-a-large-margin contributors to economic growth. Especially now that they'll be buying even more shit to distract themselves during this boring pandemic. 

4. The Fed and US gov't, unlike in 2001 or 2008, have immediately and firmly expressed their intent to provide safety nets for nearly all distressed companies and even individuals. 

5. Debt covenant compliance is almost universally being waived for the remainder of this pandemic, severely mitigating the risk of a corporate bond market meltdown.

6. Non-IG bonds will probably suffer, but: a) the majority of the main market indexes are high credit, and b) non-IG markets regularly experience bearish periods even during market-wide bull runs. Ford going under will do nothing to the rest of the market (frankly, it's been expected for over a decade).

fs3i5u,TaylorSwiftian,Why aren't more traders tactical instead of dogmatic?,"I've noticed that many traders get married to their positions such that when events change they don't change with them. This psychology affects both bulls and bears who stubbornly hold onto their positions and often maximize their eventual losses.

For instance, if you were prescient to short stocks in early Feb. and rode it to a nice gain by mid March that doesn't mean when the market turns and moves against you to double down based on a feeling how the market ""should"" go.

In 2009, by mid March the market started moving up and rallied hard, but many traders then, who might have missed the downturn, said that the stocks would resume their fall to near zero. A smarter strategy would have been to see that whatever the flaws of TARP at the time, it was unlikely that the government would allow the recession to turn into a depression.

Likewise today, the government even under Trump won't permit everything to go to hell. If in a few weeks the shelter-in-place strategy either works or is ineffective, it's probable that Trump would start to unwind the restrictions on businesses and people movement and just take the hit whatever comes.

China says manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction

PUBLISHED MON, MAR 30 20209:06 PM EDT

KEY POINTS

China on Tuesday said the official¬†Purchasing Manager‚Äôs Index for March was¬†52.0, beating expectations for an economy hit¬†by the coronavirus outbreak.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the official PMI to come in at 45 for the month of March, from a record low of 35.7 a month earlier.

China‚Äôs manufacturing activity slowed dramatically earlier this year as the government instituted large-scale lockdowns and quarantines to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19",7,1585617095,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs3gll/china_says_manufacturing_activity_expanded_in/,wallstreetbets,1

Someone linked a 5 minute youtube video on Fibonacci Retracements, and let me tell ya, I now know just about all there is to know about them. TL;DW: There are key ""support"" levels that can be used to time reversals in market direction and determine if a swing is going to be a longer-lasting trend or not.

To start with, look at [Mar 4 to Mar 10](https://imgur.com/LCFxkZs). Note the drop from 100% to 0% and the retracement (where it goes back up) to 38.2% (one of the support levels!) before dropping back down. 

[Mar 10 to Mar 14](https://imgur.com/D9EbXQq), same thing. 100 to 0, then back to 38.2 before dropping down (Green candle with long wic), then pushing through each support all the way up to 61.8% before dropping back down. 

[Mar 14 to Mar 20/21](https://imgur.com/4VcXnWI), we see the reversal from the previous uptrend, and then the market bumping on the support levels back down on the way to 0%. Note when drawing your fibonaccis that you can use an unfinished dip to try and time the bottom (I think, idfk)! 

[Mar 20 to Mar 26](https://imgur.com/nBKfb4v) we see the reversal breaking through support levels without much bounce, which strongly indicates a new upward trend.

Looking at [Mar 4 through Today](https://imgur.com/Hjb11yu) we can see that we had resistance at the 23.6% level, the 38.2% level, and have bumped against the 50% level twice, or close to it. 

How can we use this information to be forward looking? Looking at some of these price points, we can say that if $SPY gets above $265.40, it should be able to rise up into the $275 range without a lot of resistance. Conversely, since we haven't broken that 50% support level, this could be about as high as it goes before reversing and heading back down again. 

Do with it what you will, I just thought it was neat and wanted to share!

It is with sorrow that I announce that today was my breaking point. The day I realized that we cannot expect to see market norms based on news in these modern times of unlimited QE and brrrs. We can't. And I won't. 

Today I officially paper handed my puts and rolled over into calls and common stock. Like a bitch. And I made money doing it. So fuck you. 

And here's the deal. You can do it too. You really can. Futures are up again (although the markets seem to not give a shit about futures nowadays.) 

I'll probably wait until this thing hits 270-275 or so and then take my tendies to cash land and wait this thing out hoping we start trending toward a retest. Until then...fuck puts. These things paid back when volatility was at an all-time high and the market was hitting CBs daily. Now we can't even catch a -4% swing to save our lives. 

I'll take my melt up money for now.

fs2u3z,jkracx,Hitting the top tomorrow?,"*disclaimer* 
I‚Äôm *clearly* just a gay bear autist passing on what I heard from some geeks

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwHD9H5i/)

Resistance points
1. We just barely broke through a strong trendline (brr power bull trap?) into a phat double top 

2. Now we‚Äôre about to hit the .382 [Fibonacci retracement point](https://youtu.be/Kz6-8nQLRHM)  (Not easy to break through)

3. We‚Äôre also about to hit the 20 day moving average

Volume
Volume has been significantly lower for the past 3 days. Bulls running out of steam?

So all the technical analysis geeks are saying we‚Äôre at a clear tipping point.. there‚Äôs a shit ton of people with sell triggers around 265 and if we reject it we should drop like a mother fucker. If we somehow brrr through we might moon.

Fundamentals:

Bears: Virus getting exponentially worse, unemployment, shrunken gdp, etc. Economic impact will be worse than what we thought.

Bulls: Virus is a temporary problem/hoax and we overreacted, pricing in too much damage. The economy is still strong.

If you‚Äôre holding puts, don‚Äôt give up yet. Maybe hedge or rollout. 

If you‚Äôre holding calls, be careful. A lot of indicators say we‚Äôre at the top, but if we somehow retard strength our way through you can get rich asf.",345,1585614755,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fs2u3z/hitting_the_top_tomorrow/,wallstreetbets,1

fs1uxi,awptakesnoskill,The history of the printing press,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing\_press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press)

I have some evidence that will show that Mr J Pow is guilty of using machine created not too long ago to create money.

The printing press was first created about 200 after the death of Jesus. They used woodblock printing which hasn't been priced in to be fair. Look for companies that make woodblocks and buy calls on them. $SPY.

Here is where things get interesting this guy is a goldsmith so be careful. The gold man CREATED the fucking printer so gold would keep its value. evidence is right below. In the second paragraph of the wiki we can see right here. Johannes Gutenberg.

"" In Germany, around 1440, goldsmith [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) invented the printing press""

This breakthrough lead to the printing revolution. This may or may not be true but there is a rumor that an early version of the J pow printer was probably based off of Johannes's blue print design.

Ok next the Printing Revolution occurred when the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of info. Knowledge = power = money. Basically everyone and their mom started printing shit in europe during this time and it was very bad because people were now able to read. This was bad for the autists at the time because their friends could read and they were left behind to suffer. These autists are the same ones that your parents lineage came from. Nothing surprising there.

Also note jerome fucked us back in 2011 too.

""Between 2010 and 2012, Powell was a visiting scholar at the [Bipartisan Policy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Policy_Center), a [think tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank) in Washington, D.C., where he worked on getting Congress to raise the [United States debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) during the [United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011). Powell presented the implications to the economy and interest rates of a default or a delay in raising the debt ceiling.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-bpcbio-19) He worked for a salary of $1 per year.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-richest-2) ""

Source: Jerome Powell. (2020, March 29). Retrieved from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome\_Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell)

The [debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt#Debt_ceiling) was increased by $400¬†billion immediately during the Budget control act of 2011

Industrial revolution came and this is where we start to get fucked. They created this disgusting abomination that printed money even faster then ever before. Autists like you and I couldn't believe how much J powell wanted to fuck our ass holes. he went from 400 billion to unlimited?

Just so you know ‚àû / 400 Billion = ‚àû . This man wants to complete Johannes Gutenberg's mission which is to make us only use gold.

Final creation that ended the world's greatest economy. [moneymaker.jpg](https://brrr.money/)

Anyway, being as autistic as I am, I used WSB as my DD. Technicals I can‚Äôt understand: sure, I dig it. Everyone‚Äôs doom and gloom that people dying, people unemployed, garbage retail going under=recession level pressures. Sure, I can buy into that. 

But counter-take, was there anything fundamentally wrong with the economy before? Was/Is there a bubble, are debt levels too high, etc. If there is nothing fundamentally wrong and the Fed can print money and the government can bail everyone out, the only thing we are really betting on is the duration that the economy has to remain shut. If the duration is longer than expected, the Fed/gov‚Äôt‚Äôs ability to pay 
off debts and provide liquify is weakened. Which leads to the question: I think most people expect the market to re-open past Memorial Day. Is there any reason to doubt this? Is there any reason to think that if people continue to believe that is the case, that the market will have another extreme sell off? Maybe this isn‚Äôt 2008/Great Depression.

fs16yr,awptakesnoskill,The history of the printing press," [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing\_press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press)  

I have some evidence that will show that Mr J Pow is guilty of using machine created not too long ago to create money.

The printing press was first created about 200 after the death of Jesus. They used woodblock printing which hasn't been priced in to be fair. Look for companies that make woodblocks and buy calls on them. $SPY. 

Here is where things get interesting this guy is a goldsmith so be careful. The gold man CREATED the fucking printer so gold would keep its value. evidence is right below. In the second paragraph of the wiki we can see right here. Johannes Gutenberg. 

"" In Germany, around 1440, goldsmith [Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) invented the printing press""

This breakthrough lead to the printing revolution. This may or may not be true but there is a rumor that an early version of the J pow printer was probably based off of Johannes's blue print design.

Ok next the Printing Revolution occurred when the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of info. Knowledge = power = money.  Basically everyone and their mom started printing shit in europe during this time and it was very bad because people were now able to read. This was bad for the autists at the time because their friends could read and they were left behind to suffer. These autists are the same ones that your parents lineage came from. Nothing surprising there.

Also note jerome fucked us back in 2011 too. 

 ""Between 2010 and 2012, Powell was a visiting scholar at the [Bipartisan Policy Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Policy_Center), a [think tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank) in Washington, D.C., where he worked on getting Congress to raise the [United States debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) during the [United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt-ceiling_crisis_of_2011). Powell presented the implications to the economy and interest rates of a default or a delay in raising the debt ceiling.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-bpcbio-19) He worked for a salary of $1 per year.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell#cite_note-richest-2) ""  

Source: Jerome Powell. (2020, March 29). Retrieved from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome\_Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell)

 The [debt ceiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt#Debt_ceiling) was increased by $400¬†billion immediately during the Budget control act of 2011

Industrial revolution came and this is where we start to get fucked. They created this disgusting abomination that printed money even faster then ever before. Autists like you and I couldn't believe how much J powell wanted to fuck our ass holes. he went from 400 billion to unlimited? 

Just so you know  ‚àû / 400 Billion =  ‚àû . This man wants to complete Johannes Gutenberg's mission which is to make us only use gold.

How long can we keep the economy shutdown before there's irrepairable damage or before it can't come back? How long before society collapses?

fs0fpm,AnomalousAvocado,"Alright, jabronis. Let me explain what's happening to you.","I see a lot of confusion going on about what exactly is happening with The Fed, and with the economic situation we're looking at. People are disagreeing about fundamental things, saying ""this isn't correct"" blah blah blah.

We get it, Finance/Econ majors. r/iamverysmart. Their standard [M.O.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi) is to bamboozle you with an alphabet soup of acronyms: QE, MBS, BBC, etc. Then, when asked to clarify anything or getting contested, to throw up their hands and give some variant of ""You just don't get it!"" (*exasperated sigh imagined*), before terminating the conversation.

But to understand the ""fundamentals"", you really don't even need to go that far. One acronym that you *might* wanna look into is MMT, since it is getting some traction now. This is something that the stodgy old-timers like Bill Gates have called ""crazy talk"" in the past, but it's getting a ton of traction and mentions since infinite QE was announced. But without going off on too much of a tangent on that, let me get back to my main point.

What's actually happening is that the simulation is glitching. We have reached the palace of Oz, and somebody ripped off the curtain to sanitize it with Lysol, and we can now plainly see the grouchy little man sitting behind it. He wants the curtain back up as fast as possible, and is still using his same tactics to try and convince us he doesn't even exist. But in light of him standing before our eyes, it's pretty hard to reconcile this discrepancy in our minds.

What it all comes down to is this: money isn't real. It never has been. Imagine you're a medieval peasant, and some dudes on horses (pretty impressive!) come around and tell you this is their land now, and they toss you a few coins and say ""this is your money"", and then they tell you that it's very important and valuable and gives you great power - I mean just look at *them!* They have power, so it must be good stuff, right?

But they made the money. They made it up in their heads. For a while, we used shiny tokens that seemed to have a certain luster of their own (like gold), but ultimately, we abandoned that when we moved to an increasingly digital age.

*Money is nothing but a manifestation of the will of people who want to dominate others.* First they will it into existence, *as a means of* carrying out the will they already had beforehand (to dominate others and be served by them). By convincing *everyone* of this coked-up fever dream of theirs, it makes it ""real"" in our minds. You can give someone a $20 bill and they do something for you; that makes it feel like you do have a little bit of power, and this stuff is the real deal. By a number of other mechanisms, like discouraging finance education and purposely complicating it to the point that the vast majority of people don't understand it (and if they try to, they get their intelligence directly insulted, which discourages inquisitiveness generally), propaganda, and the rest, they continue to maintain this illusion. They can talk about alphabet soup and interest rates all day, but at the end of the day, ask them ""is money real?"" Nobody being honest can say ""yes"" to that question.

Now that the curtain is off, the question becomes: how long until the faith of the people in ""The Almighty System"" erodes?

**TL;DR:** Window dressing makes ETF's look better than they really are. I'm a tremendous retard who is loaded to my fat pyramid tits with puts. I am holding a bunch of 4/17 &amp; 5/15 SPY PUTS with strikes ranging between 220-270.

**Window Dressing** 
[Turning Windows Into Drag Queens](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/windowdressing.asp)

**Why would anyone turn their windows into a gay drag queen?**

Window dressing is a strategy used by mutual fund and other portfolio managers to improve the appearance of a fund‚Äôs performance before presenting it to clients or shareholders.

While window dressing overall can help a fund‚Äôs returns in the short term, longer-term effects on a portfolio are typically negative.

**How does one become a drag queen?**

* The fund manager identifies ugliest drag queens (poor performing stocks) in the portfolio

* The fund manager sells these ugly drag queens 

* The fund manager identifies the hottest drag queens (stocks performing exceptionally well) 

* The fund manager buys more hot drag queens

* The portfolio ends up being full of hot drag queens that even I would fuck

Of course, this is all done with algorithms

This is done prior to the end of each quarter to make performance reports seem as if they did better than they really did.. Right before they send these reports to investors.

The funny part is that the first quarter ends right before April Fools day. Bears will probably be made the fool though so **buy calls**. This is all probably just bull shit.

Good luck to all.

fs0bko,Main-Ant,The real RobinHood logo and the secret symbolism behind it,"A developer friend of mine who works for RH sent me this logo. He used to be tech support but after they cleaned house of their developers due to the leap year fiasco he was given an immediate promotion. He said that's how the previous team of devs got hired also, but idk if I believe it. Anyway, he was looking through old git repos for patched bugs to add back into the system and stumbled across this inversed logo, it was inside one of the original legacy branches of the app.

I made this diagram comparing the two.

[Coincidence or illuminati symbolism?](https://preview.redd.it/g00mh8eaevp41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02fb883e44ba99140801b171654d45ac1bbf01c)

Those fucking assholes. They wanted us to believe they were helping the poor like the real Robin Hood ***but they inversed it!*** 

Free trading, instant deposits, fractional shares. All free, at the low low cost of your personal data and losing access to your money during the times it matters most!

So look what happens when you inverse their logo. **It all makes sense!**

This next image might look familiar to some of you. I see looking through post positions that a lot of you have already learned to read this symbolism, but I figured I would help out the retards with a clue.

Now I won't just hand you all the answers, you're going to have to do your own research to figure out the how to decode the cipher, but I'll tell you: **the clues are all inside the logo**.

Anyway after we arrange the feathers and birds in according to the formula, we can plainly see the secret positions that we should be taking.

[Top secret positions SPY 4\/20 170P.](https://preview.redd.it/sh7dzpmievp41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998508f9d3e3d80c8735c16573f0e0f3f945d5b6)

**Here's how we decoded this postion:**

* The largest digit in **S&amp;P500** is 5, so 5 logos.
* The largest digit in **4/20** is 4, 4 logos. There's a ""/"" so you know not to flip the logo's X axis here.
* The largest digit in **170** is 7, but there's also a 1 and 0 so you subtract the largest digit from 10 instead, giving us 3 logos.
* I'll let you figure out why **PUt** has 3 logos. Again, not doing all the work for you.

I know some of you are saying this doesn't make sense, that it's backwards and I'm retarded. And I say to you: ***exactly***.

I got 69 of these for $0.31 at the peak for the ultimate top secret meme break even price of $169.69 on 4/20. You're welcome. When this hits, I may post the next top secret position.

2. People expect that we will have a downward steep drop in cases similar to China or South Korea (if you look at things plotted on a logarithmic scale, so all evolutions in time look similar even if some countries have less cases than others)

But if the numbers from China are false and other government are always reporting less cases that the reality, due to limited testing, then the markets will eventually collapse, even if the fed is abusing that printing press.

PLAY is in the top 3 highest IV for stocks traded today per: [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks?orderBy=volume&amp;orderDir=desc](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks?orderBy=volume&amp;orderDir=desc) at the 7 strike.  

That is nearly half where it is currently traded.  Earnings should be a tide of red.  I did not buy the weeklies b/c the chances of last minute games by options sellers on 4/3 Friday should be accounted for.  So I went ahead and bought the regular April expiration on the 17th at a more reasonable strike. The 2 extra weeks are worth the safety premium.

frz0fp,hasbs,My broker (Questrade) wants me to sign an NDA saying I won't talk shit about them after offering me $1200 USD as compensation for losing $50000 from outages,"I had a 0 DTE options position worth $50000 CAD that I opened that day. My broker (Questrade) had serious outages for hours that day (and for 3 days in the previous week) leaving many clients unable to access their positions. 

My position expired worthless and I was obviously very upset that I couldn't access such a volatile position for multiple hours. 

I wrote to their compliance department while also commenting everywhere on their sub warning clients and potential not to trade with Questrade because of this. The previous week after losing $10000 from a similar issue I asked a CS rep for $200 in compensation (the commissions from that day) and they refused.

After I made such a scene on the questrade subreddit the mod reached out to me to have someone call me to discuss my issues. 

After a phone call and a short email chain he requested I delete all my negative comments because there was clearly a ""bias"" being shown. 

I complied in order to see what their compensation offer would be. 

Their offer? $1200 USD.

My commissions for the past month plus $350.


In addition I would have to sign an NDA

Here's the relevant part:

https://imgur.com/a/q0vGiw0



The Releasor(s) further agree(s) to do the following:

a)	immediately refrain from making or posting negative comments about Questrade; and

b)	within two (2) days of executing the Release, remove all negative comments made on internet websites, including but not limited to blogs and to social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (collectively referred to as ‚ÄúSocial Media‚Äù), about the Releasee, to the satisfaction of the Releasee.







What a fucking joke. 


I am still waiting to hear back from compliance but I'm not holding my breath for a real offer. 

Maybe this gives all you guys who got ruined from Robinhood's outages some hope. Maybe you can get back all your Robinhood commissions. 

On a serious note though, if you were affected by Questrade's incompetence over the last few weeks check out my profile. I've made a small guide on how you can formally submit a complaint and get some kind of compensation. I'm sure for some of you the few hundred dollars is worth it. But even if not I've included steps you can take to potentially get a better offer through the ombudsman for banking.

Things like, nothing, more nothing, and literally anything but something are what drive these numbers down. 

Let‚Äôs take the global pandemic for example. 770,000+ active cases reported today, jobless numbers in the millions each and every week, literal Monopoly money printing and being injected into the markets, mass citizens getting checks - the markets react and when they do, they can either go up or up-up!

frx24h,iteamcomet,Back-of-the-Envelope Estimates of Next Quarter‚Äôs Unemployment Rate | St. Louis Fed," [https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate) 

## Current Labor Statistics

Our starting point is the state of the U.S. economy as of February 2020. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (via FRED), the civilian labor force consisted of 164.5 million people, and the unemployment rate was 3.5%.[1](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate) This means that there were around 5.76 million unemployed people in the U.S. in February. In our calculation, we assumed that the labor force remains constant and that none of those 5.76 million people would be able to find a job in the second quarter of 2020.

The important question is: How many people, on net, will be laid off during Q2? To estimate this number, we combined data from two recent blog posts that tried to compute how many jobs are exposed to layoff risk due to social distancing.

## High-Risk Occupations

In a recent blog post, Charles Gascon used 2018 occupational data from the BLS to estimate how many employees are at high risk of layoff due to social-distancing measures.[2](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate) Gascon classified 808 occupations according to three criteria:

&amp;#x200B;

* Whether those occupations are essential to public health or safety
* Whether they involve work that can be completed off-site
* Whether they are salaried

He estimated that 66.8 million people are employed in occupations that are at high risk of layoff. These include occupations in sales, production, and food preparation and services, among others.

## Occupations and Contact Intensity

In another recent blog post, Matthew Famiglietti, Fernando Leibovici and Ana Maria Santacreu combined individual-level data from the 2017 American Community Survey with information on occupational contact intensity from O\*NET to determine how many people work in occupations that require the worker to perform tasks in close physical proximity to other people.[3](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate) They found that 27.3 million workers have occupations with a high contact intensity. These include barbers, hairstylists, food and beverage serving workers, and flight attendants, among others.

## Calculating Second-Quarter Unemployment Rate

These two numbers were obtained by applying different methodologies and classifications to two different datasets. This means that while there may be significant overlap, each measure will also be capturing some aspects that the other ignores.

For this reason, we simply took the average of those two numbers as a point estimate for the total number of workers who will be laid off during the second quarter. This resulted in 47.05 million people being laid off during this period.

Summing to the initial number of unemployed in February, this resulted in a total number of unemployed persons of 52.81 million. Given the assumption of a constant labor force, this resulted in an unemployment rate of 32.1%.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Civilian labor force in February 2020 = 164.5 million (BLS via FRED)
2. Unemployment rate in February 2020 = 3.5% (BLS via FRED)
3. Unemployed persons in February 2020 = 5.76 million (#1 \* #2)
4. Workers in occupations with high risk of layoff = 66.8 million (Gascon blog post)
5. Workers in high contact-intensive occupations = 27.3 million      (Famiglietti/Leibovici/Santacreu blog post)
6. Estimated layoffs in second quarter 2020 = 47.05 million (Average of #4 and #5)
7. Unemployed persons in second quarter 2020 = 52.81 million (#3 + #6)
8. Unemployment rate in second quarter 2020 = 32.1% (#7 / #1)

## Summary of Calculations

It is worth emphasizing that this is a point estimate that makes several important assumptions. One way to think about how to bound this estimate is to take the Famiglietti-Leibovici-Santacreu number minus 10 million (workers in education and health care, who are less likely to be laid off) as an optimistic estimate for the number of layoffs during the second quarter and the Gascon number as a more pessimistic estimate. This results in unemployment rates between 10.5% and 40.6%.

There are other important caveats:

* First, these calculations  assume that the labor force is constant and exclude the fact that some      recently unemployed workers may be discouraged and not looking for      employment (and thus would not count as unemployed).
* Second, many businesses may send workers home with pay instead of laying them off outright.
* Third, these calculations do not account for any potential effects of fiscal measures, such as payroll      support measures for small businesses or changes in the generosity of unemployment insurance that may be implemented between now and the end of June.4[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate)

Moreover, one can argue that the expected duration of unemployment matters more than the unemployment rate itself, especially if the recovery is quick (and so duration is short). These are very large numbers by historical standards, but this is a rather unique shock that is unlike any other experienced by the U.S. economy in the last 100 years.

That‚Äôs not how this works, there‚Äôs no free money. Today was not going to be bloody because the last couple Monday‚Äôs were, there needs to be a catalyst. An oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia collapsing oil prices during a pandemic, for instance, is a good catalyst. 

Bad news in a time where we expect there to be bad news is not a catalyst, all these discussions about the fed collapsing the RE sector by buying MBS is a theory, not a catalyst. It could be a catalyst if it actually collapses. 

The market is as complex or as simple as you want it to be, it could be going up simply because everyone is short and there‚Äôs a lot of institutional buying for portfolio rebalancing, the buying pressure on the small float is driving prices up slowly as we are seeing now. Please use your brain and think through some other possibilities.

Buy puts, but also buy some calls and hedge, don‚Äôt buy short expiration with exposure to one side unless you want to get wrekt.

Everyone here is looking to stuff a green dildo back up Powell's ass, and hold their puts like complete retards -- myself included.  However, it is my budding shitpothesis that the economy is going to come out of this fine for the following reasons:

1. lower-middle class lost their jobs
2. upper-middle class kept the jobs, and WFH
3. the stock market rides on the upper-middle class (and above)
4. the part of the population that actually has 80% of the wealth in this country still have paychecks rolling in, and are actually saving money (or fucking losing it) as we speak.

frwgah,DogChowda,Active virus's in the US will peak this week and be 30k by mid-April,"I've been tracking and modelling to the best of my abilities the COVID19 situation. From 3/23 to Sunday 3/29 we grew in cases by 109.95k. The virus will either kill or let the human recover from what I see in about 12 days. 

Cases are going to start closing by about 10k per day - by either death or recovery (95% chance recovery). 

Assuming closed cases self quarantine &amp; do not reinfect, and that no new clusters show up. We will peak in new cases this week, we will not continue to hit record in new cases. Aggressively I expect the active case count to be about 30k by mid-April.

Why this is important: people keep expecting the case count to double every 3 days. Well thats not sustainable because people are going to die or recover. This doesn't last forever, and the average time between death or recovery seems to be about 12 days probably less.  We saw the largest spike last week and we will see a massive draw down on it soon.

Owners buying properties they ordinarily could not afford, and using AirBnB money so pay the mortgages down.","AirBnB owners are fuckin stupid. This shit is the next mortgage crisis 2.0. On the AirBNB host vent Facebook page someone writes ‚ÄúSo, are we all quitting Airbnb tomorrow or what?‚Äù to which someone responds with ‚Äúwhy is everyone mad at AirBnB?‚Äù 

The another comment or replies, ‚Äúmany people bought more than one and rely solely on Airbnb rental income to support their many mortgages and are probably going to end up in foreclosure if this then doesn't end another 30 days. ü§ê‚Äù

I see having an extra beach condo you use a couple times a year that you figure you could pick up a little extra $ on and rent out to AirBnB. But to solely rely on AirBnB for multiple mortgages????? Basically the same underlying market conditions: strong economy, jobs are high, frivolous income to spend, buy extra RE properties and rent them out to people because they had low adjustable rates. Then, rates go up, foreclosures skyrocket, mortgage backed securities go to absolute shit, it goes up the chain and boom. You know the rest. 

Buying multiple properties for the sole purpose of renting out to AirBnB that you ordinarily could not afford if you did not have AirBnB as your backup plan? No different in the thinking process than 15 years ago in 2005 when money was cheap and you could just push your interest payments down the road.

frvza9,bpmuffindrop,$NFLX Short Thesis,"Waddup gay bears??  Want some dd for your limp dick pps?

Disclaimer:  Short position on NFLX.  Not your financial adviser.

I know most of you sheep will see the title and think ""Durrr, everyone's at home with nothing to do, what else are we supposed to do besides watch Netflix.""  Well, here's the thing...Netflix doesn't make any more money on more people watching and actually has to pay more to those cloud tech nerds to take up space on their servers: their revenue is based strictly off subscribers.  I expect gross margin to be lower because of this.

Netflix has grown revenues about 25-35% the last few years, which I admit is impressive to say the least.  At this point, the US/Canada market has become saturated though with 67 million subscribers but they only grew by 5% last year, accounting for about 50% of the firm's revenue.  Subscriber growth is much higher elsewhere...EMEA grew 37%, Latin America 20%, and Asia/Pacific 53%.  Impressive stuff.

However, unemployment is going to be high across the world and I expect to see consolidation or cancelling of their subscriptions, or at the very least much slower growth and even with slower subscriber growth they can't easily offset that by increasing prices because of the increase in steaming competition.  Additionally, Karen's across the US are going ape shit crazy having to watch their kids all day and instead of watching Marriage Story for the 12th time they're going to decide to pick up Disney+ so that little Timmy and Sarah can get even more retarded by watching Phineus and Ferb.

Ok, so far we have a thesis for lower revenue growth and lower margins, but here's the best part...Netflix doesn't make any fucking money!!  No cash flow!! They're literally like the anti-fed.  You fuggers are like ""Look at their income statement, it's green!"".  Ok yeah but that's because everything they pay up front for tv show and movie rights is capitalized as an intangible asset.  Look at their cash flow statement...they're losing more and more cash for every dollar of revenue because they have to keep paying more for tv shows due to increased competition from rivals and networks realizing they were getting ripped off.  Every year they sell off more shares and increase their debt levels but nobody bats an eye.

The shares are trading near ATH and share price has been unaffected from China Flu because everyone thinks that their service is uncyclical.  In the next quarter or two I think we're going to see a drop in their growth and a correction more towards fundamentals which is at $200 IMO.",33,1585592074,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frvza9/nflx_short_thesis/,wallstreetbets,1

I put all the paper, toner etc etc. I cleaned it inside out. Made sure everything was working fine. The printer doesn't work on the weekends, so I couldn't test it. Sure enough, I couldn't sleep all night, just waiting for the printer to start printing at 9:30.

Nothing.

It hasn't done shit. Since morning. I think I cleaned it too much. It keeps giving the error ""S70NK5 60up."" Anyone else getting this error? I can't figure it out. I took everything a part again and put it back. Still nothing. Same error.

Is there any troubleshooting company I can call? Maybe I can call a person who fixes this error? But I can't find any numbers to call on google. 

Please someone help me. My tendies are not printing and I feel like I am missing out. Anyone know who I can call to fix this:?",16,1585590284,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frvehz/guys_my_printer_isnt_working_whats_going_on/,wallstreetbets,1

fruvqn,ProTrader112,A lot of clinical trial stage biotech companies are gunna get fucked,"Depending on how long the BeerFlu‚Ñ¢Ô∏è lasts, biotech companies will be severely affected. 

People who are in clinical trials are most likely not going to the testing sites out of fear of spreading and contracting the BeerFlu‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. This means that trials are going to be cancelled and delayed. This will hurt companies who have spent a lot of money, only for the BeerFlu‚Ñ¢Ô∏è to come in and mess up their testing.

As much as people like to joke around, the FDA are some strict motherfuckers. It takes an average 11 years for a drug to go all the way from discovery to consumers. The process normally goes 


Phase 1: finding how to make the drug most safe and effective 

Phase 2: finding if it is safe and effective enough 

Phase 3: comparing to the current normal for treatment, and if it is effective enough 

These phases normally go for 2-4 years interrupted to see the effects of the drugs on patients. Patients will go to the testing site to check in and recieved another dose. The BeerFlu‚Ñ¢Ô∏è will not allow patients to do this, effectively messing up the data and then the trial. The company will then have wasted a ton of money and need to get more.

TLDR: short preclinical and clinical biotech companies Bc they won‚Äôt be able to test their patient during beerflu",23,1585588621,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fruvqn/a_lot_of_clinical_trial_stage_biotech_companies/,wallstreetbets,1

People love their animals and now that they are forced to stay home Chewy is being inundated with more orders than they can even process. Because of this Chewy has hired 400 employees to try and get through the backorders that just keep piling up. 

Market cap is huge and buying ITM or close to ITM is almost free money since this stock is one of the few who is showing consistent gains during this current recession and downtrend.

frtz0o,NBCCOL,Brazil has a serious problem,"There are 2 key reasons why Brazils economy will be hit harder than most, and of course its all from CV-19:

1. As CV19 spreads around the world, it's no secret that Brazil's reaction has been.. unique. [Their president responded to criticism of his inaction by saying 'we're all going to die one day.'](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brazils-bolsonaro-downplays-coronavirus-risks-were-all-going-to-die-one-day-2020-03-29) and they haven't issued any all-encompassing national lockdowns. As of today, churches are still very much open and gatherings are encouraged. 

Brazil's cases jumped from [eight on march 5th](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil/brazil-confirms-eighth-coronavirus-case-as-it-spreads-across-country-idUSKBN20S2WJ) to [904 on march 20th](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/20/819348888/surge-of-coronavirus-cases-in-brazil-brings-warning-of-health-care-collapse) to [4000 yesterday](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/29/in-coronavirus-versus-brazil-bolsonaro-stands-almost-alone/) and they are continuing to rise. Unlike most countries with thousands of cases, Brazil's outbreak is almost entirely uncontrolled, with national authorities calling it a 'hoax' (that sounds familiar) as it spreads wildly untested and uncontrolled. 

Additionally, Brazil is mostly in the southern hemisphere, so the US's wonderful warm summer (when many experts speculate the disease will slow) will be a colder time for Brazil -- encouraging the spread that much more.

2. The other key reason is a bit less obvious. Jumping over the pond to the UK, [64% of ICU patients are overweight](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8142005/Being-obese-raises-coronavirus-risk-Medics-warn-patients-high-BMI-likely-die.html) -- that's right. Fatties = hospital beds thanks to Corona. Now lets look at Brazil: [55% overweight.](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2019-07/obesity-brazil-198-2006-2018) 

So you have a largely overweight population, which leads to a majority of hospitalization requirements, and a government not taking this seriously in the slightest. Not to mention the cases just doubled in 3 days as we're seeing elsewhere in the world. 

Short Brazil.

frthhx,johntwit,A Safe Bet? Using Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) And VWAP Momentum To Time Intraday Price Reversals,"I learned about VWAP from an episode of Chat with Traders featuring Zach Hurwitz, who calls himself""the VWAP trader."" I rememthim saying ""don't take my word for it, just put it on your chart."" I did and I immediately noticed its value for intraday options trading.

A few things I noticed about VWAP: 

1. The price of high volume equities like SPY crosses the VWAP line a few times a day. 

2. The slope of the VWAP lines correlates with future price action. The longer the slope has remained positive or negative, the stronger the correlation with future price action.

3. The rate of change of the VWAP slope (VWAP momentum) will peak slightly before a price reversal. This is a leading indicator. It's the only leading indicator I've ever seen on a chart.

How to use for intraday trading:

If VWAP slope is positive, err on the long side. If VWAP slope is negative, err on the short side.

In general, stay long while VWAP slope is positive and stay short when VWAP slope is negative.

If price is below VWAP and VWAP slope is positive, buy. If price is above VWAP and VWAP slope is negative, sell. 

Use price history to see how far price moves from VWAP. Use this distance as your support and resistance levels. You will get a couple big trades a day when price moves far from VWAP.

VWAP momentum will peak slightly before price reversal. Use VWAP momentum peak to time reversals. 

Use divergence between price action between VWAP momentum and price direction to gauge whether a market is bullish or bearish. If price is descending while VWAP momentum is positive, for example, that is a bearish signal.

I work in banking and right now the bank I work for is offering 90 - 180 day payment deferrals on all existing business loans as long as they claim they are affected by Rona. We are not the only financial institution offering this. Payment deferrals are also being offered on some personal loans. 

I've seen some accounts getting these deferrals and they are digging into their lines of credits &amp; their savings to stay afloat, some won't be able to pay back even if they bounce back to their regular income because of the increased debt.

Possible bear rally a few months from now, but for now gay bears keep waiting while stonks go up.

frstz7,rpcullen,Please listen this time.,"The üåàüêª fun is done post #2.

Large corporations that are included in indexes have already hit their bottom last week and since then, they've gotten relief from the government stimulus bills, as well as some have begun producing medical equipment to keep up with supply. The hedge fund managers aren't buying based on wether or not your girlfriend's boyfriend dies, or if they are unemployed. The majority of the 3.5 million unemployed will be rehired once quarantine is over so all that number really means is that the corporations that laid them off now don't have to pay them in full during quarantine. That is saving the business money, which investors like. The influx of buying is based on the fact that, over the next two months, the only things that can and will happen are companies opening their doors back up, hiring your gfs bf back, and start printing money like the good old days. Don't invest based on what is happening to the people, invest based on what WILL happen to the corporation in the future.

Silently walking through narrow-minded people,  
seeing atrocious signage of their views on  
various topics of discussion.  
End results, conclusions, based on theories  
and myths of their own illusions.  
Attempting to force others to see their side-  
ways thinking without giving or showing an  
iota of proof or reality set in truths.  
Being cut with double-edged tongues, as silently  
I continue walking through narrow-minded people  
on my way to explode them with limitless  
imagination and thought, coinciding with reality  
and the proof it honestly carries with it.

Should drive monster increase in revenue for Q1 (and massive tendies for everybody)

Position: Long 15,000 shares cash equity targeting $25/share

# Turtle Beach ($HEAR)

***Description:***

An absolutely mediocre small-cap company (mkt cap: $80mm) making headsets that only acne covered teenagers chugging energy drinks in their parents' basements could love. The last time the stock spiked was when Fortnite became popular in 2018... driving insane demand for headsets (and stock was a 10+ bagger) so that kids could play online while chatting with each other.

Company is the market-share leader in gaming headsets with app. 43% in 2019.

***Catalyst:***

Demand for video-games during Coronavirus is soaring with even end-of-cycle consoles being sold out and demand for video games spiking.

Market knows this already and that's why every perma-bull and their grandma is buying $ATVI, $EA, etc.

But what they're not watching is the market for accessories (headsets in this case)

&amp;#x200B;

[Google Trends... Red: \\""Headset\\"" \/ Blue: \\""Turtle Beach\\""](https://preview.redd.it/zi9ynekuysp41.png?width=1143&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=094789dd67f24c3b74c123cec67197f815b79278)

&amp;#x200B;

[More searches for \\""Turtle Beach\\"" now than the peak during the Fortnite craze](https://preview.redd.it/q2chr4szysp41.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76506229e9d6e51e7151c75de95a240be2ee29e5)

And before you make the whole ""but what if people are searching for headsets to use for company Zoom meetings?""

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eiaz9wv9zsp41.png?width=383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a90b4f61a55b7d4188909eb98b815380ebabce

Plantronics/company use headsets are way, way, way down the list

&amp;#x200B;

[Seasonality](https://preview.redd.it/yre7yakizsp41.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4535529ca3ea733db673c9f313ac6fa01d60aca)

Search for the company has seasonality (search spikes during Black Friday and Christmas... some increase during summer), but you can see that searches have spiked way above trend recently (dotted line is where the search levels should be according to seasonal trends). Right now search levels are around 74% higher than they would be normally. Higher than the yellow line (2018) when $HEAR spiked up 15x b/c of Fortnite driven demand

But why didn't the executives say anything about this during their earnings report on March 10th?

If you want to look at humanity in a good light, they didn't know b/c search volumes started to spike on March 14th. If you want to think the worst of people, it's b/c the money-grubbing exec are buying shares before the stock rallies:

&amp;#x200B;

[CEO and director bought shares recently](https://preview.redd.it/9zrb6c0g0tp41.png?width=1283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=218e33b40debfcfcbba783c233c0059b4a699b96)

According to their March 10th earnings call:

They have sufficient inventory and the ability to switch production if need be:

&gt;""And of course, having non-China production also enables us going forward to have the ability to flex production between China factories and non-China factories and gives us just simply a more diversified supply chain...""

They also couldn't forecast what demand would be like:

&gt;""And remember that gaming is something that people do at home for entertainment so just by its nature, it‚Äôs hard to judge whether that‚Äôs going to have an impact on us or not, but it‚Äôs something we are watching very closely.""

It's pretty obvious from gaming trends and trends data that people are buying these mediocre headsets, but that the market isn't pricing this in due the shift happening right after earnings/guidance.

***Upside:***

Change in sales has not been priced in and as stated above... it's been a mediocre company with sloppy execution for years... no one in their right mind would be looking at this piece of shit...

And as with any company of this impeccable caliber, there's a sizable level of short interest (22.7%) and high # of days to cover (10.6 days).

&amp;#x200B;

Company has just recently announced earnings and guidance, so the recent changes in fundamentals haven't been priced in. Last time this company had a huge tailwind (sales increase due to Fortnite... current interest levels are higher than Fortnite peak) the stock shot up from $1-2 to mid-30's. 

With short interest where it is and a premium on Coronavirus theme stocks, can see this easily shooting up to mid $20's (small cap so potential for massive overshoot). For all you options addicts, don't know how much liquidity there is in options for this name, but if I'm right, stock should move like options anyways.",134,1585575737,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frr0e8/long_turtle_beach_hear_overlooked_coronavirus_play/,wallstreetbets,1

frqqc4,johntempleton,‚ÄúThis one is scarier‚Äù: Obama-era officials say current economic crisis is fundamentally different from 2008,"The Great Recession in 2008 was supposed to be a once-in-a-generation economic calamity. Just 12 years later, the United States is facing a far more daunting crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

‚ÄúThis one is scarier to me, because we knew how to handle the other one,‚Äù former Rep. Barney Frank, a lawmaker who was central to crafting the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation, told Vox. ‚ÄúThe other one was a result of human error and bad decisions. This is different.‚Äù

Among the central differences between the two is the unprecedented public health emergency that‚Äôs taking place now. Thus far, Congress has rushed to authorize a $2 trillion economic relief package, but interviews with several lawmakers and advisers who worked on the 2008 stimulus bills suggest the US government may have to think even bigger in the future ‚Äî depending on how long the coronavirus outbreak lasts.

The size of the stimulus that‚Äôs been approved so far already dwarfs that of bills passed during the financial crisis. Taken together ‚Äî the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that passed under President George W. Bush (also known as bailing out the banks) and the $840 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that passed under President Barack Obama ‚Äî had a combined cost of around $1.5 trillion.

‚ÄúEverything this time is happening bigger and faster,‚Äù said Jason Furman, a former economic adviser to Obama, who played a key role in designing the administration‚Äôs response to the financial crisis.

For one thing, Republican lawmakers who obstructed Obama‚Äôs recovery efforts at the start of his term have shown no qualms in working with a Republican president to pass trillions in stimulus.

In 2009, ‚Äúthere was no Republican help,‚Äù former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obama‚Äôs chief of staff from 2009 to 2010, told Vox. ‚ÄúMitch McConnell said forget it.‚Äù",0,1585574681,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frqqc4/this_one_is_scarier_obamaera_officials_say/,wallstreetbets,1
frqqaq,hjkoivu,A SERIOUS warning about this crisis,"I'm gonna be honest here.  Every bull out there should be nervous in this blind optimism.  First of all the VIX is still very elevated.  Second, we've been receiving nothing but bad news and stocks are still going up.  Third, It looks like we might have another housing crisis on our hands and no one is taking it seriously.  You can say priced in all you want, but the fact is people are not pricing it in.  Just because big tech, Amazon, Costco and Walmart is doing well doesn't mean that everything is good.  Oil, airlines, hotels, small businesses, casinos, restaurants are all big parts of the economy and are failing as we speak.  

Mortgages are being defaulted and we have a risk of another 2008 level crisis here and people are just breezing along like nothing is wrong.  People are failing to realize that this is not just the coronavirus to worry about.  This is only exposing pre-existing problems and on top of that we have a pandemic on our hands.  This is a financial crisis and a pandemic at the same time!  You think government would really be passing 2 trillion stimulus bills and the FED printing money in overtime and giving unlimited QE if there was no financial crisis?  They are only saying that to not create panic! You think that at a time when everyone is panicking over the coronavirus they would say ‚Äúoh by the way we might be having a repeat of 2008?‚Äù 

While one can never predict the future, I have serious reservations about this ridiculous recovery we seem to be experiencing at a time when it is still unknown the full extent of how the coronavirus will impact us and understand how our economy is really doing.  When we are receiving record breaking reports that are bad and the market goes up that is not a sign to buy in.  2009 was one thing when the market was down 50% from ATH at the time and had been in a bear market for quite a while. It‚Äôs another thing when we have been in a bear market for about two weeks and all of a sudden we are in a new bull market while data is getting far worse and we still haven‚Äôt really seen the economic consequences? That doesn‚Äôt seem right to me.  

How can you price in the unknown and think that everything is just as good as its as pre-virus?  That would be irresponsible and I urge you guys to think carefully before buying calls and thinking that we are having a v-shaped recovery.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, March 30th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-30-2020.html)

*****

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a modest decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average at Monday‚Äôs open after President Donald Trump extended national social distancing guidelines to April 30. The Dow, which closed 4% lower Friday, did soar 12.8% for the week, logging its best weekly gain since 1938 and raising questions about whether blue chips have bottomed. However, heading into Monday‚Äôs session, the Dow was still nearly 27% off last month‚Äôs record highs. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained below 1% early Monday. U.S. oil prices sank below $20 per barrel, near 18-year lows hit earlier this month.

*****

&gt; * On Sunday, mortgage bankers warned that Federal Reserve mortgage purchases are unbalancing the home lending market. In addition to the Fed‚Äôs extraordinary no limit fixed-income purchases, Wall Street analysts and economists said it would not be out of the question to see the central bank take for the first time ever a passive interest in the performance of the stock market.

*****

&gt; * Preparing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 from the coronavirus, Trump on Sunday walked back his previous remarks about wanting to reopen the country for business by Easter. In continuing social distancing until the end of next month, the president said, ‚ÄúNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won.‚Äù Earlier on Sunday, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the country could see up to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections. However, he also cautioned that those numbers are based on outbreak modeling and nothing is certain.

*****

&gt; * The U.S., which has the most known coronavirus infections in the world, saw confirmed cases jump to over 143,000 with 2,513 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New York has about 40% of those cases and fatalities. A field hospital has been set up inside New York‚Äôs Central Park to treat coronavirus patients. Abbott Laboratories, which received FDA emergency use authorization on Friday for a test that can detect coronavirus in 5 minutes, was praised by Trump. ‚ÄúAbbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week,‚Äù he said. Abbott shares were soaring about 8% in the premarket.

*****

&gt; * Global coronavirus cases increased to over 730,000 with 34,685 deaths and more than 149,000 recoveries. Italy, No. 2 to the U.S. in cases with about 97,700, has the worst death toll. Italy‚Äôs 10,779 fatalities are more than three times as many as China‚Äôs 3,308 deaths. Rounding out the top three, Spain just surpassed China in infections, with over 85,000 cases and more than double China‚Äôs death toll at 6,803. China, where the pandemic started in December, has the world‚Äôs fourth most known infections, nearing 82,200 cases. Germany is No. 5 in worldwide cases at about 62,400. It has 541 deaths.

*****

&gt; * Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, plan to strike on Monday to call attention to what they claim is the lack of protections for employees. Chris Smalls, a management assistant and a lead organizer of the strike, told CNBC that workers at the fulfillment center known as JFK8, have grown increasingly concerned about coming into work after an employee tested positive for the coronavirus there last week. Amazon told CNBC that the company was supporting the individual in quarantine and asked anyone who was in contact with the worker to stay home with pay for two weeks. JFK8 remains open.

frpgxd,mndl3_hodlr,Go cover call yourself,"We all have that friend that we wish we could puts on. But what if you're that friend?


Well, you could buy puts on yourself, like life insurance. But there's two problems with that:

- you have to pay first

- you won't use the money


So, I had this idea. If you are the underlying, and you want to profit on your own downside, why can't you sell covered calls on you. Seems legit, right? But how can you sell calls on somebody. And how to cover that?

Here's the answer:


**UGLINESS COVERED SPERM DONATION**


The main problem about donating (selling) sperm is that someone will actually use it, and you may end up with a few kids running around. But, since the majority of us are fat ugly losers, the probability of some woman wanting our precious manmilk is almost zero.


So, it's like you're selling a call, with you as the underlying, but that will never expire. You get the money upfront, it will never be exercised, and the cycle can forever go on. I've researched a little, and you can get $50 for every donation (plus $20 if you're selected, read exercised). I can easily jerk of at least 2 times a day, so, it would be $100/week, with weekends off.

Plus, I'm sure there's some kind of law that cannot discriminates you for being ugly.


It can even become some kind of inside joke that we can identify other WSB in real life. You can use go cover call yourself when trying to insult someone, and other artists from here will hear the calling and help you, if you're in trouble.

froqrb,Dane1414,Mortgage Servicing Crisis Explained... from an MBS Trader,"This is in response to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/friwc9/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained/

I have to start working in about 15 minutes so this is going to be brief, have shitty formatting, and a bunch of typos.

My background: I'm a junior mortgage backed security trader at a well-known financial institution. I work primarily with non-agency MBS but also do a lot of work with agency credit risk transfer (CRT) bonds. TL;DR of CRT bonds is they are issued by the Fannie and Freddie and they pay less if Fannie and Freddie start taking losses on the mortgages they guarantee.

Given my time constraints, I'm going to pick and choose what  I respond to/clarify in the original post. Overall it is a fantastic write-up, but I feel there's a couple of things I can add to it given I have a different view of the industry given my different position.

&gt;although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower.

My understanding in agency loans is the servicer is heavily incentivized but not legally required to advance the principal and interest payments. Basically, if their loans start taking heavier losses than other servicers and they don't advance, this will hurt their relationship with Fannie/Freddie. However, if this is happening across the board, everyone's rating goes down so it doesn't impact the servicers competitiveness relative to others. So, while it's not good for a servicer to not advance P&amp;I, it's not a major breaking point.

&gt;I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP In the Government‚Äôs effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it.

It's not clear to me whether forbearance has to be advanced, so I'll take the OP's word for it. I'd recommend someone with more time to actually look into what Fannie and Freddie expect regarding forbearance.

&gt;But what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender‚Äôs ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.

This is true and could present a massive issue, but as of right now we don't know how many people will actually miss their first payment. I think it is likely that a large number of people refinancing to lower their rate are the same demographic who will have a few months savings as a cushion, but who knows what % don't.

&gt;MARK TO MARKET This week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender‚Äôs servicing portfolio reduces the Lender‚Äôs overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.

This is true, however in other mortgage products we saw a large rebound in value this last week. Also, at this point most if not all credit providers are offering forbearance to these firms who can't meet margin call. However, if mortgages and related products have another drop in value it could be painful.

I'm out of time but wanted to touch briefly on how mortgage servicers hedge. My understanding is this section contains the biggest inaccuracy in the original post. Mortgage servicers do NOT hedge using MBS, they hedge by shorting pools of mortgage loans. While there are still downsides to this due to the negative convexity of mortgages, these are a more direct hedge than MBS and remove a layer of the disjointedness that markets have been experiencing the last few weeks.

Oh, one more thing. Most of this stuff is already priced in. Remember those CRT bonds I mentioned in the beginning of this post? Some of those bonds have gone from trading at ~$140 to in the $20s, representing an 80% drop. And you guys thought equities were performing poorly, lol.

TL;DR shit is bad and can get worse, but isn't quite as bad as the OP.",151,1585566255,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/froqrb/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained_from_an_mbs/,wallstreetbets,1

Now, let me just say I am incredibly autistic so this may be how options are supposed to be used. 

SELL Puts on stocks at strike prices you like due to the high premiums right now, that way if you get assigned them its a win because you get a company for a discount, and if the money printer continues to hum, you hedge your puts through the premiums that you are being paid on your sold puts.

TLDR;
Sell puts on companies you like to hedge your actual puts.

Did anybody see this?

While everyone's battling the virus, the Chinese decided to move into the Philippine sea. They've wanted this area for years and they decided now is their opportunity. 

The US has put them on notice with a few warning missiles.

[ttps://news.antiwar.com/2020/03/25/us-navy-fires-missiles-in-philippine-sea-sending-message-to-beijing/](https://news.antiwar.com/2020/03/25/us-navy-fires-missiles-in-philippine-sea-sending-message-to-beijing/)

frladw,mildlyburner,Coronavirus Mutation: Why are we talking about it as an ‚Äúif‚Äù not a ‚Äúwhen‚Äù?,"Everyone here seems to know that mutation is one of the potentially bearish triggers that could send the market into an even more precipitous tailspin. Specifically, a mutation that increases virulence (without significantly decreasing transmissibility). This is, in fact, what happened with the Spanish Flu: the second wave was caused a more virulent form of the original virus, which was responsible for a majority of the mortality. 

What I don‚Äôt get is why people talk about mutation as this binary thing that *might* happen. That was my original understanding as well, until I started doing some digging on the topic. Mutation is not an if, but is a virtual certainty when detailing with this type of virus (coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RdRP, so mutations and recombination events frequently occur). Even more so when acting on a host population this large. 

So, the question is not whether the virus will mutate/evolve. The question is whether it will get more or less virulent over time. 

Turns out, there are historical precedents that could inform how the 2019-nCoV will evolve... From what I can tell, the precedents are not comforting. 

Detailed notes on precedent cases below. It looks like majority of viruses get more virulent over time (at least up until the point where lethality inhibits transmissibility). Perhaps most worryingly, the most similar virus to 2019-nCoV‚Äîthe original SARS Coronavirus‚Äîgot more virulent over time. Over the 2002‚Äì2004 SARS epidemic, the virus evolved to better bind to cellular receptors and replication in human cells, enhancing virulence.

Notes on Evolution of Virus Virulence and Transmissibility:

1. Detailed study of big viral outbreaks in animals (Australian and UK rabbits and birds) 
From article: https://www.the-scientist.com/features/do-pathogens-gain-virulence-as-hosts-become-more-resistant-30219 
    * Benign strains were less infectious because host immunity was able to control and clear them more rapidly
    * After initial wave, virus evolved. Virulent of the isolates harvested from the field and frozen in the 1990s caused laboratory rabbits to develop a highly lethal immune collapse syndrome
        * Rabbits die at about the same rate as those infected with the original virus, but they do so without developing classical symptoms  
        * Instead, death is associated with a form of toxic or septic shock characterized by an almost complete absence of cellular inflammatory responses, allowing normally well-controlled bacteria to run rampant in the test rabbits. Evidently, the virus evolved the ability to very profoundly immunosuppress rabbits. 
        * From our phylogenetic and molecular-clock dating studies, our best estimate is that viral genes encoding this phenotype first arose sometime between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
        * Why did the virus evolve in this way? The most likely explanation is that hyper-immunosuppression was the evolutionary answer of the virus to resistance that evolved in wild Australian rabbits.
        * The resistance that evolved clears MYXV infections more rapidly, and so reduces virus transmission. Importantly, resistance is not perfect: it does not prevent infection or transmission. The virus can thus evolve in resistant rabbit populations, and so any viral mutants that are better able to overcome enhanced antiviral host defenses will be favored by natural selection. 
        * Example: Hyper-immunosuppression is precisely the sort of viral adaptation that could arise in such circumstances.
        * Common garden experiments have shown that escalating viral virulence in response to increases in host resistance is not unique to MYXV in Australia.
        * The same thing happened in Europe after a different strain of MYXV was released for rabbit control following the Australian successes. Wild rabbits became more resistant over time, and field isolates of the virus ramped up in virulence. Viral strains isolated in the U.K. around 2010 even caused hyper-immunosuppression in lab rabbits, just like the viruses that had evolved earlier in Australia.
        * Few diseases have been subject to the scale of common garden experimentation that Fenner and colleagues lavished on MYXV (these studies are not easy or cheap), but escalating virulence in response to naturally selected host resistance seems to have occurred wherever researchers have looked for it.
        * For instance, in the late 1990s, highly lethal rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) escaped from quarantine while Australian authorities were investigating it as a possible biocontrol agent against rabbits. It, too, decimated wild rabbit populations, which consequently evolved resistance against RHDV. In turn, even more virulent viruses evolved.
        * Virulence also increased after a bacterial pathogen of poultry, Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), jumped into the Eastern US house finch population sometime in the mid-1990s. 
        * In house finches, MG causes severe conjunctival inflammation that affects over-winter survival. When it first emerged, house finch populations declined by up to 60 percent. Over the subsequent 15 years, MG virulence increased. 
        * In the early 2000‚Äôs, a relatively low-virulence strain of MG established itself in Pacific house finch populations, and the same thing happened again: virulence increased through time. On both sides of the continent, these increases occurred as partially immune survivors became common in finch populations.
        * Thus, nasty pathogens of birds and mammals evolved to become even nastier following six separate emergence events on three continents. Importantly, these six cases cover a diversity of pathogens, including a large DNA virus (MYXV), small single-stranded RNA viruses (RHDV and WNV), and a bacterium (MG). 
        * For two of these (MYXV and MG), virulence increases occurred on two separate occasions. 
        * The quality of the evidence that the changes in pathogen virulence was caused by rising resistance in the hosts varies, but it is hard to imagine in any of these cases that the increasingly virulent strains could have much of an evolutionary future in highly susceptible hosts, which would likely die before the infectious agent could be transmitted. In all likelihood, the hosts had gained sufficient resistance to ensure somewhat prolonged infectious periods for the more virulent strains. We know of no cases where controlled experiments have shown declines in pathogen virulence in the face of rising host resistance.
        * We know of no cases where controlled experiments have shown declines in pathogen virulence in the face of rising host resistance


2. Journal article on 2019-nCoV and original SARS. From article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300265
* The severity of disease is most often an important indirect factor in a virus‚Äôs ability to spread. Because coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRP), mutations and recombination events frequently occur. 
* Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV mutated over the 2002‚Äì2004 epidemic to better bind to its cellular receptor and replication in human cells, enhancing virulence. 
* It is thus important to examine whether 2019-nCoV behaves like SARS-CoV to adapt to the human host and whether this would increase the R0 value and change its virulence. 
    * By contrast, MERS-CoV has not mutated substantially since it was discovered, which may be due to that the functional cellular receptor (CD26) used by MERS-CoV is quite unique so the virus has a very limited potential to mutate without losing fitness. 
    * Notably, ACE2, the receptor protein of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, and coronaviruses can infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals. 
* In the case of 2019-nCoV, there have been some clues suggested that, sometimes, an individual with highly severe 2019-nCoV disease will only cause a few infections, conversely, individuals with a moderate disease or latent infection can occasionally cause many infections, though the molecular mechanism is not yet understood. A possible consequence of this is that viral mutations that pose a low health threat on the individual level may pose a high risk on the population level. 


3. Article on virulence in bird viruses and impact of immunizations. From article: https://phys.org/news/2013-05-diseases-rapidly-evolve-moreor-lessvirulent.html
* A novel disease in songbirds has rapidly evolved to become more harmful to its host on at least two separate occasions in just two decades, according to a new study. The research provides a real-life model to help understand how diseases that threaten humans can be expected to change in virulence as they emerge.
* They found that in both regions the disease had evolved to become more virulent over time. Birds exposed to later disease strains developed more swollen eyes that took longer to heal. 
    * In another intriguing finding, it was a less-virulent strain that spread westward across the continent. Once established in California, the bacteria again began evolving higher virulence.


4. From book: The Great Influenza by John Berry
* 1872 the French scientist C. J. Davaine 
* To determine the lethal dose he measured out various amounts of this blood and injected it into rabbits. He found it required ten drops to kill a rabbit within forty hours. He drew blood from this rabbit and infected a second rabbit, which also died. He repeated the process, infecting a third rabbit with blood from the second, and so on, passing the infection through five rabbits.
* Each time he determined the minimum amount of blood necessary to kill. He discovered that the bacteria increased in virulence each time, and after going through five rabbits a lethal dose fell from 10 drops of blood to 1/100 of a drop. At the fifteenth passage, the lethal dose fell to 1/40,000 of a drop of blood. After twenty-five passages, the bacteria in the blood had become so virulent that less than 1/1,000,000 of a drop killed.
* Davaine‚Äôs series of experiments marked the first demonstration of a phenomenon that became known as ‚Äúpassage.‚Äù This phenomenon reflects an organism‚Äôs ability to adapt to its environment. When an organism of weak pathogenicity passes from living animal to living animal, it reproduces more proficiently, growing and spreading more efficiently. This often increases virulence.
* In other words, it becomes a better and more efficient killer.
* Changing the environment even in a test tube can have the same effect. As one investigator noted, a strain of bacteria he was working with turned deadly when the medium used to grow the organism changed from beef broth to veal broth.
* But the phenomenon is complex. The increase in killing efficiency does not continue indefinitely. If a pathogen kills too efficiently, it will run out of hosts and destroy itself. Eventually its virulence stabilizes and even recedes. Especially when jumping species, it can become less dangerous instead of more dangerous. This happens with the Ebola virus, which does not normally infect humans. Initially Ebola has extremely high mortality rates, but after it goes through several generations of human passages, it becomes far milder and not particularly threatening.
* So passage can also weaken a pathogen. When Pasteur was trying to weaken or, to use his word, ‚Äúattenuate‚Äù the pathogen of swine erysipelas, he succeeded only by passing it through rabbits. As the bacteria adapted to rabbits, it lost some of its ability to grow in swine. He then inoculated pigs with the rabbit-bred bacteria, and their immune systems easily destroyed it. Since the antigens on the weak strain were the same as those on normal strains, the pigs‚Äô immune systems learned to recognize‚Äîand destroy‚Äînormal strains as well. They became immune to the disease. By 1894, veterinarians used Pasteur‚Äôs vaccine to protect 100,000 pigs in France; in Hungary over 1 million pigs were vaccinated.
* The influenza virus is no different in its behavior from any other pathogen, and it faces the same evolutionary pressures. When the 1918 virus jumped from animals to people and began to spread, it may have suffered a shock of its own as it adapted to a new species. Although it always retained hints of virulence, this shock may well have weakened it, making it relatively mild; then, as it became better and better at infecting its new host, it turned lethal.
* Macfarlane Burnet won his Nobel Prize for work on the immune system, but he spent the bulk of his career investigating influenza, including its epidemiological history. He noted an occasion when passage turned a harmless influenza virus into a lethal one. A ship carrying people sick with influenza visited an isolated settlement in east Greenland. Two months after the ship‚Äôs departure, a severe influenza epidemic erupted, with a 10 percent mortality rate; 10 percent of those with the disease died. Burnet was ‚Äúreasonably certain that the epidemic was primarily virus influenza‚Äù and concluded that the virus passed through several generations‚Äîhe estimated fifteen or twenty human passages‚Äîin mild form before it adapted to the new population and became virulent and lethal.
* In his study of the 1918 pandemic, Burnet concluded that by late April 1918 ‚Äúthe essential character of the new strain seems to have been established.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúWe must suppose that the ancestral virus responsible for the spring epidemics in the United States passaged and mutated‚Ä¶. The process continued in France.‚Äù
* Lethality lay within the genetic possibilities of this virus; this particular mutant swarm always had the potential to be more pestilential than other influenza viruses. Passage was sharpening its ferocity. As it smoldered in the roots, adapting itself, becoming increasingly efficient at reproducing itself in humans, passage was forging a killing inferno.
* On June 30, 1918, the British freighter¬†City of Exeter¬†docked at Philadelphia after a brief hold at a maritime quarantine station. She was laced with deadly disease, but Rupert Blue, the civilian surgeon general and head of the U.S. Public Health Service, had issued no instructions to the maritime service to hold influenza-ridden ships. So she was released.
* Nonetheless, the condition of the crew was so frightening that the British consul had arranged in advance for the ship to be met at a wharf empty of anything except ambulances whose drivers wore surgical masks. Dozens of crew members ‚Äúin a desperate condition‚Äù were taken immediately to Pennsylvania Hospital where, as a precaution against infectious disease, a ward was sealed off for them. Dr. Alfred Stengel, who had initially lost a competition for a prestigious professorship at the University of Pennsylvania to Simon Flexner but who did get it when Flexner left, had gone on to become president of the American College of Physicians. An expert on infectious diseases, he personally oversaw the sailors‚Äô care. Despite Stengel‚Äôs old rivalry with Flexner, he even called in Flexner‚Äôs prot√©g√© Paul Lewis for advice. Nonetheless, one after another, more crew members died.
* They seemed to die of pneumonia, but it was a pneumonia accompanied, according to a Penn medical student, by strange symptoms, including bleeding from the nose. A report noted, ‚ÄúThe opinion was reached that they had influenza.‚Äù
* In 1918 all infectious disease was frightening. Americans had already learned that ‚ÄúSpanish influenza‚Äù was serious enough that it had slowed the German offensive. Rumors now unsettled the city that these deaths too came from Spanish influenza. Those in control of the war‚Äôs propaganda machine wanted nothing printed that could hurt morale. Two physicians stated flatly to newspapers that the men had not died of influenza. They were lying.
* The disease did not spread. The brief quarantine had held the ship long enough that the crew members were no longer contagious when the ship docked. This particular virulent virus, finding no fresh fuel, had burned itself out. The city had dodged a bullet.
* By now the virus had undergone numerous passages through humans. Even while medical journals were commenting on the mild nature of the disease, all over the world hints of a malevolent outbreak were appearing.
* In London the week of July 8, 287 people died of influenzal pneumonia, and 126 died in Birmingham. A physician who performed several autopsies noted, ‚ÄúThe lung lesions, complex or variable, struck one as being quite different in character to anything one had met with at all commonly in the thousands of autopsies one has performed during the last twenty years. It was not like the common broncho-pneumonia of ordinary years.‚Äù
* The U.S. Public Health Service‚Äôs weekly¬†Public Health Reports¬†finally took notice, at last deeming the disease serious enough to warn the country‚Äôs public health officials that ‚Äúan outbreak of epidemic influenza‚Ä¶has been reported at Birmingham, England. The disease is stated to be spreading rapidly and to be present in other locations.‚Äù And it warned of ‚Äúfatal cases.‚Äù
* Earlier some physicians had insisted that the disease was not influenza because it was too mild. Now others also began to doubt that this disease was influenza‚Äîbut this time because it seemed too deadly. Lack of oxygen was sometimes so severe that victims were becoming cyanotic‚Äîpart or all of their bodies were turning blue, occasionally a very dark blue.
* On August 3 a U.S. Navy intelligence officer received a telegram that he quickly stamped¬†SECRET¬†and¬†CONFIDENTIAL.¬†Noting that his source was ‚Äúreliable,‚Äù he reported, ‚ÄúI am confidentially advised‚Ä¶that the disease now epidemic throughout Switzerland is what is commonly known as the black plague, although it is designated as Spanish sickness and grip.‚Äù
* Many histories of the pandemic portray the eruption of deadly disease‚Äîthe hammer blow of the second wave‚Äîas sudden and simultaneous in widely separated parts of the world, and therefore deeply puzzling. In fact the second wave developed gradually.
* When water comes to a boil in a pot, first an isolated bubble releases from the bottom and rises to the surface. Then another. Then two or three simultaneously. Then half a dozen. But unless the heat is turned down, soon enough all the water within the pot is in motion, the surface a roiling violent chaos.
* In 1918 each initial burst of lethality, isolated though it may have seemed, was much like a first bubble rising to the surface in a pot coming to boil. The flame may have ignited in Haskell and set off the first burst. The outbreak that killed 5 percent of¬†all¬†French recruits at one small base was another. Louisville was still another, as were the deaths on the¬†City of Exeter¬†and the outbreak in Switzerland. All these were bursts of lethal disease, violent bubbles rising to the surface.
* Epidemiological studies written relatively soon after the pandemic recognized this. One noted that army cantonments in the United States saw ‚Äúa progressive increase in cases reported as influenza beginning with the week ending August 4, 1918, and of the influenzal pneumonia cases beginning with the week ending August 18. If this was really the beginning of the great epidemic wave we should expect that if these series of data were plotted out on a logarithmic scale the increase from week to week would plot out as a straight line following the usual logarithmic rise of an epidemic curve‚Ä¶. This condition is substantially fulfilled with the curve of rise plotting out on logarithmic paper as a practically straight line.‚Äù
* The report also found ‚Äúdefinite outbreaks of increasing severity‚Äù occurring during the summer in both the United States and Europe, which ‚Äúindistinguishably blend with the great Fall wave.‚Äù

frl61z,jojobeebo,Thoughts on when the pandemic will end and what companies are in the best position to succeed?,"Markets are very emotional right now. So, not very rational. That said, cV is starting to infect rural America now.

So, I think a lot of the Trump bulls will start to realize how serious the situation really is. And, any progress on the vaccine front will be welcome news.

Either way, vaccine or not, I don‚Äôt believe the world will ever be the same. cV has changed the world forever.

Virologists have said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, but world governments are fast tracking any trials. So, I think they can shave 3-6 months off of initial estimates. So, we‚Äôre looking at 6-12 months for a vaccine.

Apparently, there are eight strains of the virus. So, would that vaccine cover all 8 strains? And, would it be 100% effective?

Then, what about production of the vaccine? Do we have enough resources to make it quickly enough? I recall that in recent years there were shortages of flu shot.

By that time, I think world economies will be permanently damaged.

Case in point, can Disney survive without any theme park, cruise, and theater revenue for 6-12 months? Same with airlines, hotel chains, restaurants, professional sports, and tourism-based businesses.

I suspect world governments will have to heavily subsidize their domestic industries. And, the companies that thrive are the ones that can succeed in this new reality. So, any companies that aren‚Äôt reliant on in-person interactions will outperform. I like ZM, WORK, MSFT, CRM, NFLX for these reasons especially if a vaccine isn‚Äôt developed in a timely fashion or isn‚Äôt particularly effective.",49,1585547060,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frl61z/thoughts_on_when_the_pandemic_will_end_and_what/,wallstreetbets,1

If your portfolio is 100% puts right now, I have some advice for you: grow a fucking brain dumbass. It is easy to make money in times of short-term volatility. How about the long-term when things are more stable? 

Look into some stocks or etfs of your choosing that you know will eventually grow in value once again. Drop some money into them. Again, stocks, not options. If you lose all your money on options in the coming weeks/months, you will at least have these stocks that you buy now grow in value and help you out down the road. The returns are not as great, but it is a safe investment and a guaranteed strategy to make you money (unless civilization collapses).

Shit like this is short sighted - Videos of empty local hospitals. People are trying to claim the whole pandemic is an act. These are the ones I assume are buying fat calls right now. Their inability to understand what ""preemptive"" means, or what a 14+ day incubation period is. Perhaps the market will pump tomorrow, because people aren't directly seeing the damage being done at their local hospitals(yet). Think back to when Trump(Feb 28), basically called the virus a hoax at his rally. The same day markets had their first major bounce after falling -15%(SPY) from ATH. Fast forward to today and you have people down playing the risk again because they don't see it in their face this very second.

I believe this is where it'll bite them in the ass -  as it did earlier this year. We're witnessing more ignorance to the virus's strength, Asymmetric spreading - The ability to have the virus, show no symptoms for up to 14 days, and spread it to another individual. 

I think they'll be in for a rude awakening by mid-late April, more specifically NYC.

frji1u,JavaSE_,BECKY and CHAD walk into a gas station,"So I work at a gas station in a college town in Pennsylvania. So we are one of the few food service establishments still open. Being a college town, we have a fair amount of BECKYs and CHADs. So let me recount to you a story that happened at work this weekend. 

So BECKY is standing in line waiting to pay for her overpriced soda and candies. BECKY is not stupid, she did her research on snapchat before going out into the scary infected world for some munchies on a Sunday night. She is fully prepared with her disposable gloves, standing 6 feet apart from other customers, and doing everything else she read that she is supposed to be doing. Queue boredom. BECKY has been standing in line for all of 30 seconds when she gets bored and decides that now is a good time to adjust her glasses, touch her face and rub her eyes. She does all of these things while wearing her disposable gloves that just touched every surface in the entire store. Good job BECKY. Good job.

Not to be outdone by BECKY, CHAD comes up to get his banana protein shake with ""immunity support"" supplement. CHAD sees myself and my coworkers, including the cashier, wearing gloves because, well we are a food establishment. CHAD starts yelling at the cashier mansplaining to her about how wearing gloves makes you ***more*** likely to catch beer virus. His reasoning for this, people do not know how to properly wear gloves. CHAD, I am autistic, food service is the only form of employment I can get.

You can skip to the tl;dr at the end. Or read if you want all the DD. I know I never read posts on here.


Either way, here's a quick recap + play based on some analysis.

# March 8th - The 2020 Russia-Saudi Arabia Oil Price War

On [March 8th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_oil_price_war),
due to the drop in demand due to reduced travel as well as OPEC and Russian price
disagreements, the price of oil dropped 34% in the US. Regardless of the reason,
the now much lower [spot price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_contract) for
oil is the main reason for this investigation and strategy.

# March 10th - Wells Fargo Congressional Hearing
Wells Fargo testified the day after the Bloody Monday.
I wrote way too much on this, so I cut it, but if you just watch these five
minutes, you'll get an idea https://youtu.be/tyxEcDvneZI?t=12251

My take away from this was:
- Wells Fargo has 23 billion of exposure to Oil energy sector
- Over 55% of that is in the form of second-lien debt which will default
- **All the large banks have been similarly leveraged against Oil**

# March 13th - USA Buys Oil
Trump declares a national state of emergency, and [buys **$2.4 billion** worth of
crude oil](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-To-Buy-77-Million-Barrels-Of-Crude-For-Strategic-Petroleum-Reserve.html) (77 million barrels at around $30/barrel).
What a solid purchase, with the price of Oil now just over $20 as of writing.
There's an art to deal making, that's for sure.

In all likelihood, the reason didn't matter, purchasing the Oil simply allows for
them to foot some of the corporate debt that they're afraid will default.

### March 17th - Fed Expands to buying up A1/P1 debt
The Fed announces it will establish the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF),
and that it will create a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to purchase [asset-backed commercial
paper rated A1/P1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200317a.htm).

The A1/P1 bonds include A to AAA, but not the BBB bonds.
Also the CPFF only goes in to effect [In the first half of April](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/commercial-paper-funding-facility/commercial-paper-funding-facility-faq).

This is important to note for the strategy, since you may fear that the bonds have
been purchased by the Fed themselves. But fear not.

### March 24th - Open-ended QE / All debt + ETFs
JPow announces that [he's just gonna print until we run out of ink](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm).
Not only that, but _everything is on the table_ for the CPFF. (keep in mind that
this has not yet started).

This is the bluff my fellow bears. JPow knows that we can't just print the market into
a V yet. We need whatever digital currency will replace the dollar before we get
there. But at this point, he's just tired of announcing so regularly that they will
be doing unprecedented actions. After all, he doesn't want the announcement to
negatively impact market sentiment.

### March 25th - Fidelity Rebalances
https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/markets-sectors/stock-market-drops-2020

This is just here because it's absolutely exploitative, so I need to call it out.
All these analysts know that it's getting worse. He even says it at the top. Then
goes on concluding that we're not at the lows yet, but that they're going to
rebalance the 51/49 stock/bond back to the 60/40 target and realize losses during
the biggest bull trap in history. Why not wait until next week if you think it's
going to get worse? I'll let you decide the answer to this on your own.

A few hundred billion will be rebalanced ""next week"". March 30th to April 4th.
We will see the affect that this amount of capital has on the markets.

This is why taking finances into your own hands is so critical.

However, this is just one example of what some pension funds are doing.
They plan to sell 9% of their bonds, and buy back into stocks.
Realize losses; buy high, sell low. You can't make this shit up.

### March 29th - 15 (+30) Days to Slow the Spread

Now that we got confirmation that Trump is ready to dump, now is the time to
capitalize. The market is going to drop soon. We might be green tomorrow, but
rest assured; we are still bound for a drop until a digital currency to replace
the dollar is made.

## Analysis / What do I play?

LQD and VCIT are the two most popular ""investment grade"" (BBB) corporate bond ETFs.

They both have a large exposure to US Financial company's at around 35%.
Which, as I stated before are heavily leveraged against Oil. Additionally, they
both have sizeable ""Industrial"" sectors at around 60%.

When comparing the two in order to determine profitability, we can look at the
Beta values and trade Volatility Arbitrage in order to profit on the ""return to mean"".
Now, I know that this isn't a real mean, and responsible trading would result in
a ""delta-neutral"" portfolio. But we all know what subreddit this is and where the
market is going. So listen up.

LQD has a [Beta of 1.87 by my math](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0jyLEYgzUY3DG8I86nU3KTYDVlv2etWAmEWgOVqXSQ/edit?usp=sharing) against VCIT,
when using the three month time frame from 9/1/19 until 3/1/20.
This holds even longer, but standard is last 3 months. So I used the time up until
before the crash.

This high correlation provides a great opportunity to take profit on the current
overbought nature of LQD.

Graph: https://i.imgur.com/PMa5S3f.png

Additionally, it appears quant funds have already bought up LQD in MASSIVE amounts.
(No, it's not the Fed, they can't do that on ETFs directly... yet.)
I believe that these funds or algorithms KNOW that LQD provides more room volatility,
and thus higher profitability. This is why there is the [unusual purchase activity](https://i.imgur.com/ms7icbZ.png). When compared to [VCIT](https://i.imgur.com/mKA43QR.png).
It could also be just the piece of shit pension managers like the Fidelity case
all flocking to that attractive yield and following others.

Personally, I think that with Oil at the current price, nearly 40% of these bonds
will be downgraded or lose their yield. This is nowhere near priced in. When this
falls it is going to fall HARD. The longer Oil is priced low, the longer this will
happen.

**$70 LQD Puts 6/19** - go big or go home. It has 40% exposure to bonds that will likely default.
Close position before mid-April. Compare with VCIT to determine when it is due for 
a volatility contraction (and your puts will lose value).

friwc9,HowGreatAreYourDanes,Mortgage Servicing Crisis Explained,"I'm a Loan Officer for one of the larger retail lenders. Here‚Äôs an overview of how the Fed gone and fucked over mortgage lenders. 

THE CORONAVIRUS MELTDOWN
The current coronavirus crisis is having a critical impact on the mortgage industry, which could potentially make the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. The pressing issue centers around capital that's required by Mortgage Lenders to be able to function and meet covenants that are required for them to continue to lend. 

HERES HOW THE MORTGAGE MARKET WORKS
Let's begin with the mortgage process. A borrower goes to a Mortgage Originator to obtain a mortgage. Once closed, the loan is handled by a Servicer, which may or may not be the same company that originated the loan. The borrower submits payments to the Servicer, however, the Servicer does not own the loan, they are simply maintaining the loan. This means collecting payments and forwarding them to the investor (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie), paying taxes and insurance, and answering questions, etc. While they maintain or ""service"" the loan, the asset itself is sold to an aggregator or directly to a government agency like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The loan then gets placed in a large bundle, which is put in the hands of an Investment Banker. The Investment Banker converts those loans into a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) that can be sold to the public. This shows up in different investments like Mutual Funds, Insurance Plans, and Retirement Accounts. 

The Servicer's role is very critical. In order to obtain the right to service loans, the Servicer will typically pay 1% of the loan amount up front. The Servicer then receives a monthly payment or ""strip"" equal to about 30 basis points (bps) per year. Because they paid about 1% to obtain the servicing rights and receive roughly 30 bps annual income, the breakeven period is approximately 3 years. The longer that loan remains on the books, the more money the Servicer makes. In many cases, the Servicer may want to use leverage to increase their level of income. Therefore, they may often finance half the cost of acquiring the loan and pay the rest in cash. 

SERVICER DILEMMA
As you can imagine, when interest rates drop dramatically, there is an increased incentive for many people to refinance their loans more rapidly. This causes the loans that a Servicer had on their books to pay off sooner‚Ä¶often before that 3-year breakeven period. This servicing runoff creates losses for that Mortgage Lender who is servicing the loan. The more loans in a Mortgage Lender‚Äôs portfolio, the greater the loss. Servicing runoff, or even the anticipation of it, can adversely impact the market valuation of a servicing portfolio. But at the same time, Lenders typically experience an increase in new loan activity because of the decline in interest rates. This gives them additional income to help overcome the losses in their servicing portfolio. 

But the Coronavirus has caused a virtual shutdown of the US economy, which has created an unprecedented amount of job losses. This adds a new risk to the servicer because borrowers may have difficulty paying their mortgage in a timely manner. And although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower. Under normal circumstances, the Servicer has plenty of cushion to account for this. But an extreme level of delinquency puts the Servicer in an unmanageable position.

I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP
In the Government‚Äôs effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it. Fortunately, there is a new facility set up to help Mortgage Servicers bridge the gap to the investor. However, it is unclear as to how long it will take for Servicers to access this facility.

But what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender‚Äôs ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.

MARK TO MARKET
This week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender‚Äôs servicing portfolio reduces the Lender‚Äôs overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
The Fed‚Äôs desire to bring mortgage rates down isn‚Äôt just damaging servicing portfolios because of prepayments, it‚Äôs also wreaking chaos in Lenders‚Äô ability to hedge their risk. Let‚Äôs look at what happens when a borrower locks in their mortgage rate with a Mortgage Lender. Mortgage rates are based on the trading of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). As Mortgage Backed Securities rise in price, interest rates improve and move lower. A locked rate on a loan is nothing more than a lender promising to hold an interest rate for a period of time, or until the transaction closes. The Lender is at risk for any MBS price changes in the marketplace between the time they agreed to grant the lock and the time that the loan closes.

If rates were to rise because MBS prices declined, the Lender would be obligated to buy down the borrower‚Äôs mortgage rate to the level they were promised. And since the Lender doesn‚Äôt want to be in a position of gambling, they hedge their locked loans by shorting Mortgage Backed Securities. Therefore, should MBS drop in price, causing rates to rise, the Lender‚Äôs cost to buy down the borrower‚Äôs rate is offset by the Lender‚Äôs gains of their short positions in MBS.

Now think about what happens when MBS prices rise or improve, causing mortgage rates to decline. On paper the Lender should be able to close the mortgage loan at a better price than promised to the borrower, giving the Lender additional profits. However, the Lender‚Äôs losses on their short position negate any additional profits from the improvement in MBS pricing. This hedging system works well to deliver the borrower what was promised, while removing market risk from the Lender.

But in an effort to reduce mortgage rates, the Fed has been purchasing an incredible amount of Mortgage Backed Securities, causing their price to rise dramatically and swiftly. This, in turn, causes the Lenders‚Äô hedged short positions of MBS to show huge losses. These losses appear to be offset on paper by the potential market gains on the loans that the lender hopes to close in the future. But the Broker Dealer will not wait on the possibility of future loans closing and demands an immediate margin call. The recent amount that these Lenders are paying in margin calls are staggering. They run in the tens of millions of Dollars. All this on top of the aforementioned stresses that Lenders are having to endure. So, while the Fed believes they are stimulating lending, their actions are resulting in the exact opposite. The market for Government Loans, Jumbo Loans, and loans that don‚Äôt fit ideal parameters, have all but dried up. And many Lenders have no choice but to slow their intake of transactions by throttling mortgage rates higher and by reducing the term that they are willing to guarantee a rate lock.

Furthering the Fed‚Äôs unintended consequences was the announcement to cut interest rates on the Fed Funds Rate by 1% to virtually zero. Because the Fed‚Äôs communication failed to educate the general public that the Fed Funds Rate is very different than mortgage rates, it prompted borrowers in process to break their locks and try to jump ship to a lower rate. This dramatically increased hedging losses from loans that didn‚Äôt end up closing.

EVEN STEPHEN KING COULD NOT HAVE SCRIPTED THIS
It‚Äôs been said that the Stock market will do the most damage, to the most people, at the worst time. And the current mortgage market is experiencing the most perfect storm. Just when volume levels were at the highest in history, servicing runoff at its peak, and pipelines hedged more than ever, the Coronavirus arrived.
Lenders need to clear their pipelines, but social distancing is making it more difficult for transactions to be processed. And those loans that are about to close require that employment be verified. As you can imagine, with millions of individuals losing their jobs, those mortgages are unable to fund, leaving lenders with more hedging losses and no income to offset it.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW
Fortunately, there are many smart people in the Mortgage Industry who are doing everything they can to navigate through these perilous times. But the Fed and our Government needs to stop making it more difficult. The Fed must temporarily slow MBS purchases to allow pipelines to clear. Lawmakers need to allow for first payment defaults, due to forbearance, to be saleable. And finally, the Fed must more clearly communicate that Mortgage Rates and the Fed Funds Rate are not the same. We have faith that the effects of the Coronavirus will subside and that things will become more normalized in the upcoming months.


So, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on - I‚Äôd love some input on the best way to use this info for trades. Personally I think that mid-sized loan servicers with minimal diversity are most at risk. Quicken isn't publicly traded, Wells Fargo is too big for their mortgage servicing alone to cripple them. 

So, what servicers are at risk? Cut and paste: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) today released its mid-year rankings of commercial and multifamily mortgage servicers' volumes as of June 30, 2019. At the top of the list of firms is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., with $681.8 billion in master and primary servicing, followed by PNC Real Estate/Midland Loan Services  ($655.2 billion), KeyBank National Association ($273.1 billion), Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC  ($268.4 billion), and CBRE Loan Services ($208.3 billion).

I like CBRE personally - they are exposed to residential MBS and to commercial MBS, retail property management, and just all around their revenue is from parts of the r.e. market that are likely to get fucked pretty hard.

So, I haven't taken this position yet but will this week - 9/18/2020 CBRE 35p.

TLDR: In the last 4 weeks the Fed has bought 189 billion worth of mortgage backed securities. 89 billion more than any 4 week period during the 2009 recession.

This has effectively blown up mortgage brokers hedges and are causing margin calls. The mortgage brokers association has reached out to FINRA and the SEC for reduced regulations in regards to margin calls in order to prevent further destabilization.

The Fed has another scheduled 40 billion purchase tomorrow.

In short the Fed is fucked if they do and fucked if they don't.

frh1h8,Aectto,"Gold mining futures will spike, the dollar will crash, and $JNUG literally cannot go down.","Hello fellow bears,

It has come to my attention that it‚Äôs no longer an ‚Äúif‚Äù but rather a ‚Äúwhen‚Äù that the U.S. Dollar will crash. We‚Äôre entering a period of stagflation, impulsively increasing our national debt by 10%, and we‚Äôre printing worthless cash as if there is no tomorrow.

So, let‚Äôs talk about something that is actually valuable: gold. Gold has barely gone up during our 12 year ~~bull run~~ bubble, and it‚Äôs ready to surge. Time to buy some gold coins, right? Wrong. Sure, using physical gold might get you to the front of the line for a little while once the trusty old benjamin starts to take a dive, but let‚Äôs be honest, the government is probably going to regulate physical gold like they‚Äôve done in past recessions anyway.

The solution? Gold futures. Actually, gold *mining* futures. $JNUG is a great way to bet on gold miners. Sure, mines are closing down all over the world, but that will only up demand for gold, and spikes in $XAUUSD hype up $GDXJ, a gold mining ETF. When $GDXJ, gets bought up, the gates are released for the $JNUG bulls to drive prices to numbers that won‚Äôt even fit on your screen.

It has been super oversold because of all the bagholders buying up $JDST, the inverse of $JNUG, in hopes that the market has reached its bottom (wrong) and news of mines shutting down (which is actually good news, because gold demand will skyrocket further). In fact, $JNUG was just recently comfortably trading at $70 to $80 or so a share, and has now dropped below $5. Will it continue to drop? No. And that‚Äôs because my research has confirmed that $JDST, its inverse, will continue to drop instead, especially as last week‚Äôs hype will sell off this coming Monday PM and people‚Äôs attention will once again be on $JNUG. When people see that the market is red, there is even more incentive for them to get in on the bargain. Inflation in the dollar will keep the surge strong. It will be like a blast of cold air, once we feel the economic effects of the stimulus bill, because I think we can all agree that blowing the bubble bigger is not a viable solution.

That‚Äôs all for today kids, be bear or be square. You heard it here first!

TL;DR: Gold good, fiat currency bad, dollar crash soon, gold mining make gold, decrease in dollar buying power and gold production means increase in gold value, play gold mining futures for easy tendies",67,1585529317,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frh1h8/gold_mining_futures_will_spike_the_dollar_will/,wallstreetbets,0

frgtsc,KidEatsSoaps,SPY TA Price Action Possibilities,"TA: https://imgur.com/a/6YM3kri

Based off what I‚Äôm seeing SPY broke out of its upward channel and hit $245 during futures. With current price action it‚Äôs forming a Elliot Wave pattern sequence. Currently we are in wave four based off the wave pattern. If price holds there it can bounce upward towards 255+ given wave 5 is usually the shortest compared to 1 &amp; 3. Also wave 3 can never be the smallest for the pattern to be valid. After all five waves are complete, it is followed by a ABC retracement. If the Elliot wave pattern fails we can see a drop towards 230 or less. 

TL;DR wait for an entries and don‚Äôt be retarded.

Thought I would provide an update for everyone on what has been happening with my play below.

After the nice profit i flipped to vix puts (as my posts indicated), then sold them all March 24th for about 300%. Didn't post cause i thought i would compile it with what happens on this next part of my play. I sold them all on that morning but i also loaded up on VIX calls again. Premium went sky high minutes later so the timing couldnt have been better. Have basically been holding 150% profit throughout the whole rally so im not complaining lol. I am expecting somewhere around 100 for VIX when we peak. (and yes we haven't peaked yet as i indicated to numerous people on various posts).

So i was going to have this really nice explanation with all my thoughts posted and some nice humor and beautiful crayon TA charts (even bought a new crayola set just for this moment) etc. But this other analyst bastard keeps posting ahead of me. SO I'm just gonna reference him here and his post and basically say he has my blessing. Just close your eyes and pretend im saying the same shit.

Price action right not looks like a gap fill. Oil looks weak. Equities will follow commodities as he discussed. Price action looks like a gap fill right now and Oil is holding support. After the gap is filled tho...... not promising. 

Here is a gap fill look. I would be surprised if we wake up to see it went above 2520.

frgmoj,Maxw3llD3m0n,CCP has launched war and this sub wants funny or BAN.,"Lurker, Short term Gay bear and Permabull.

If China wins Gay bears win allow me to explain my thesis. The world is going going to sharply polarize over the role of China in the Coronavirus. We know which side the freedom loving people of the world want to be on. We know which side the Dictatorial nations would support.

"" As of 2018, there are currently a total of fifty nations that have a  dictator or authoritarian regime ruling the nation to this day "" - World population review \[1\]

Which is a surprisingly large chunk of the world and then we have ISIS. China is many steps ahead and is already on overdrive with its propaganda machinery.

With Boris Johnson coming out and saying that China has been lying about its corona virus case numbers many other countries will follow suit and gather the Cahoonas to openly criticize China. People of the free and democratic world will force the leaders will not allow their leaders to join China, which has always be happening Hush Hush. Coronavirus is just the cost of doing business with China and people have started to realize that.

It's no coincidence that Saudi and Russia Launched their attack on the overly indebted Shale Oil Industry. It looks like they are picking their side. Why exactly would Russia and Saudi suddenly decide to launch a price war in the middle of a damn crisis? They know if China wins they have enough money to cover up their loses.

How will this end ? It's hard to say, It's possible that people will continue to drown themselves into video games and whatever else and not care as China slowly and methodically dismantles the free world. Otherwise the Free world and the Permabulls will stand together and Rise up against China. In which case the Chinese society will likely either implode  from the inside and become a democratic society or become like North Korea and completely isolated from the world. It's hard to speculate beyond this point.

If China wins they will be confiscating the tendies you printed buying puts for being critical of the Chinese regime. The Gay bears truly win once and for all spy will go to zero as it all belongs to China now.

However, I'm feeling generous tonight and want to share this with you morons. Take it however you fucking want to, I don't care one bit.

*Disclaimer: I am not your fucking financial advisor.*

**Thoughts:**

Leading up to this past week, it appeared the VIX was in a corrective wave 4 down to the low 50s (which was hit on 3/24) and it appears it will make its final wave 5 over a period of time. Nobody fucking knows how fast or slow this happens, and that remains to be seen. However, from the voraciousness of buying and selling in the market, combined with how many of your wives have boyfriends, it should happen sooner than later.

VIX likely fucking bottomed near-term on 3/24 and I suspect this corrective wait should find major support around the 50 level. I am looking for the VIX to butcher its way to new ATHs, just like Carole Baskin butchered her husband and fed him to tigers. Not necessarily in a straight line, but the next leg down in equities is likely next week as cases in the US start to ramp up and ravage the domestic economy. Get fucking horny bears, it's cumming.

Based on additional bull/bear profiles and sentiment, this is **UN-FUCKING-LIKELY** to be the bottom in the markets and I recommend people only scalp and swing-trade. If you do enter longs (retards), be prepared to lose an additional 10-15%. It is likely the SPX finds overall support (i.e. support where rallies aren't sold to new lows) somewhere around 1800 in my opinion. Yes, my fucking opinion.

It is important to recognize at this time that tomorrow, Monday, is going to be VERY green. 
I think it is important for us to acknowledge very clearly in our posts about how GREEN, the stock market will be tomorrow. 
We have simply reached the bottom, and I think it is time to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô stocks right now. 

It is more important than ever that the rest of the world understands we will be buying very many stocks at the first chance we get.

frg3ch,catsmeow492,$SPY Technical Analysis ‚ÄìSlightly Bullish $257c 4/17," YouTube Walkthrough on TA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4po98mWFQzA

For the Retards: Markets aren‚Äôt rational, get over it. The bull-trap is running out of steam and it looks like it‚Äôs got another 3 days to 1.5 weeks of steam left in it. I‚Äôm picking up a short term call that I hope to sell of buy Wednesday then looking for a call credit spread entry over 265.

Ticker: $SPY

Intervals: 1W, 1D, 1H

Indicators: Aroon, MACD, RSI, MA(200 &amp; 50), ATR, NetVolume, VPVR

Signals: 

1W: Aroon Bearish, MACD Bearish Increasing Divergence, Net Volume (1.3G) Bullish, KDJ Oversold Converging 

1D: Aroon Bearish, MACD Slightly bullish, Net Volume (-220M) Bearish, KDJ Slightly Overbought Divergent

1H: Aroon Bearish, MACD Bearish but Converging, Net Volume (-17k) Neutral, KDJ Neutral

Position: Short Term $257c 4/17, tight stop. Long-term call bear spread sell 275c buy 280c.

Targets: Take profit on 257c 262 or above and look for entry for call credit spread.

News: \[‚ÄúThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use for a portable, fast, swab test for the coronavirus Friday which can provide results in less than 15 minutes.‚Äù\] ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-first-covid-19-pointofcare-test-from-abbott-234449283.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-greenlights-first-covid-19-pointofcare-test-from-abbott-234449283.html))

‚ÄúPresident Donald Trump extended social distancing guidelines to April 30 and said the coronavirus outbreak in the US is likely to peak in two weeks.‚Äù(https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-presser-extends-social-distancing-guidelines-until-april-30-2020-3)

Analysis: Weekly interval indicators are still signaling bearish however daily interval indicators are still signaling bullish indicating some residual steam left in the bull-run. Long/Call position face significant risk as resistances become increasingly significant after 260. 274 and 289 VPVR predict as the most significant resistance price level in SPY‚Äôs history (if it ever reaches those levels). Typical retracement for these types of sudden bounces put targets around 275 making 265 a much safer target. Long term bearish trend along with increasing Coronavirus shut downs make a long-term bearish movement almost inevitable. This increases the need for diligent position management on short-term trades.

Multiple indicators that sales are up big time.

* March 24: [Hiring 400 workers](https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/chewy-hiring-400-amid-increased-demand-1.2610778)
* March 29: [Hiring 6000 workers](https://foxsanantonio.com/features/coronavirus/americans-are-panic-buying-pet-food)
* Homepage: *A message about current events: Dear Pet Parents, Chewy is always here for you. Due to high demand, current delivery times are running considerably longer than usual on food and supplies. Stay well and thanks for choosing us.*
* An increasing number of reports across the country that animal shelters are completely empty, all dogs and cats adopted. These new owners obviously have to order pet food and since everybody now shops online, this means increased volume at Chewy, Amazon and Walmart

Even if they miss the earnings due to cost increase, their future guidance will pump the price even further.

frfhlt,Cagethepanda,A brief explanation of options for stoolies.,"With the influx of new traders we're going to see I figured I'd explain some of the basics for you.

Positions:

420 Spy C 4/17. This is a call. A call means you call bullshit on a stock and think it will crash. Use this if you think A stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 4/17 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.

420 Spy P 4/17. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to. The easiest way to remember this is P= Profits. Buy them when stocks are going to go up. The same expiration date information applies to puts.

DD= Don't Do it. This where users argue against what they believe is going to happen to strengthen their arguments. Anything you read in a dd should be taken as false it is strictly a thought experiment.

Finally, let's talk about IV this is Instant Value. The higher the IV the more likely your position is to make money. The higher the IV the cheaper options are. This is when you want to buy them.",878,1585523644,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/,wallstreetbets,1267

I said on Thursday that since almost every stock touched their 20 day moving average that we would now be headed down from there, which we are. Oil futures dropped big at open tonight, down over 6%, and is now hovering right at $20 and will likely be in the teens by tonight or early this week. 

With the explosion of cases now occurring in the United States...this week will be hell. Trump extended social distancing until the end of April. As more cases explode we will see even more of a disruption than we already have in global supply chains which are in absolute dismay right now. We‚Äôre now on the second leg down to print a new bottom. 

FYI: 15 days to slow the spread was announced on March 16th. We had 4,132 cases that day. 14 days later and we have 137,459 cases and growing. Let that sink in.

My price targets are SPY $163 and TSLA $150-$200 by May 15th. Laugh all you want, I‚Äôm sure you would of laughed at me if I told you TSLA was going to be trading in the $350‚Äôs only 34 days after it hit $968. So fuck you bulls.

I have a lot of other technicals that I‚Äôm using and I‚Äôll be updating throughout the week.

 Her research has shown:

&gt;Peak exhalation speeds can reach up to 33 to 100 feet per second (10-30 m/s), creating a cloud that can span approximately 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m). Protective and source control masks, as well as other protective equipment, should have the ability to repeatedly withstand the kind of high-momentum multiphase turbulent gas cloud that may be ejected during a sneeze or a cough and the exposure from them. Currently used surgical and N95 masks are not tested for these potential characteristics of respiratory emissions.

Research is showing that social distancing at 6 feet is likely to be ineffective and should be 27 feet, thus making most efforts and current mask efforts a questionable means of control.

fre3w6,plotusdotcom,24% drop in earnings / 1.58 Months of Shutdown Priced In. Not Nearly Enough. Slow but deeper drawdowns coming,"**TLDR:**

**-Market is pricing 1.58 Months of Shutdown**

**-We cannot stay at these Covid19 active case growth rates for more than 2 months before a vaccine is developed. Since a vaccine will unlikely be developed in the next 4 months, shutdown must be longer and more restrictive.**

**-S&amp;P 500 Pre-Crisis CAPE Ratio of 33, Currently 25.5 without dropping earnings. Long Term Average 17.03. Extremely overvalued.**

&amp;#x200B;

For markets, it‚Äôs not so much about the absolute number of infections or deaths in the first order, but how long policies will be in place that disrupt earnings. Currently, 1.58 months of disrupted earnings are priced in. From a preservation of human lives standpoint, this is not enough and a longer shutdown with possibly more restrictive orders will be required.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is it implied that 1.58 months of shutdown is expected?**

As of Feb 21. SP&amp;500 P/E Ratio was about 25, currently it is 19, assuming no change in what the market deems it should pay for earnings is, this implies a 24% drop in earnings.

What is the effect on monthly earnings of the shutdown? Blended profit margin for S&amp;P 500 is 11%, variable costs that can at best save 80% of costs. Assuming only 10% of revenue generated, if shutdown last a year, that‚Äôs a loss of $107 vs an earnings of $132 from 2019.

This loss per month is about $9. How many months of $9 dollar losses and a miraculous jump back to $11 a month of earnings to reach our implied 24% drop in earnings?

(-9\*m + (12-m)\*11)/132 -1 = -24%

76% \*132 = (-9m-11m+12\*11)

100.32 = -20m + 132

\-31.68 = - 20m

M = 1.58

*Market is pricing 1.58 months of shutdown.*

**Is this feasible?**

Let‚Äôs assume a vaccine can get widespread adoption in 200 hundred days, a miracle in of itself, even in this scenario, only 1.58 months of shutdown would be devastating.

New covid-19 cases are currently occurring at a rate of about 23% of the previous days active cases. At this rate, the current inconvenience felt doesn‚Äôt make a dent in the spread of covid-19. In 2 months, we‚Äôd almost be at 200 million infected. Even assuming that the previously infected cannot get re-infected, a majority of the US population gets infected before any vaccine can even have an effect.

If we get to South Korea‚Äôs rate of 2% through even more extreme practices in lockdown, then things look good where we can actually reduce the total active infected. However, as soon as we stop that 1.58 months of trying and go back to our 23%, we‚Äôll shoot back up to 200 million infected in 3 months. (It took as longer this time because we were starting from a lower number).

In short, there cannot be more than 2 ‚Äì 3 months where we have an active infection growth rate of 23% before we get the vaccine.

As gung-ho as the President is to get the economy working again, I don‚Äôt know if other parties would allow him to given consequences.

This was a very rough estimate with many gross assumptions, but it seems that as things seem to be, there is no reasonable way things can get back to how they were without significantly more sacrifice. The market has underpriced the negative effects of the shutdown. Even in the event of a recovery, valuations relative to earnings were already substantially high relative to long run averages and it is unlikely that they would return to such levels of exuberance in inflation adjusted terms.

While all this is bearish, the time horizon is unclear. Impact on earnings might only most noticeably be seen in Q2 which will be reported much later in the year.

**The Trade:**

Straight puts are ill-advised with IV as high as it is. Bear Put spreads could be preferable in picking expiries further out past July. (In hindsight in writing this, I too realised that mine were expiring too soon)

While it may feel late, long positions could be sold and tax-losses harvested. Alternatively, covered calls could be sold on your existing longs.

In addition, I've personally sold ES=F short.

frdv0u,-LiveFreeOrDie,Monday Crash and Tuesday Rally,"This is purely speculation and 100% autistic.

Lots of ideas about bull trap and market liquidity issues, I agree with. I think Monday will bleed and Tuesday will be a green dildo, then back to the scheduled downfall of the stonk market.

1. [On Tuesday Korea will be injecting 12 Billion in to the US](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/bank-korea-offer-12-bln-030000433.html). 
2. [The end of Q1 and the re-balancing of management portfolios.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-does-end-quarter-mean-portfolio-management.asp)

[Reading up on the Wyckoff Price Cycle](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method) and [Elliot Wave Theory.](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:introduction_to_elliott_wave_theory) (Thanks Variation-Separate).

The stonk market is oblivious to all shit news, last weeks gainz were a clear example. This leads me to believe that the market was oversold so an ""automatic rally"" was bound to occur, but what if Friday (3/29) was a bear trap, a bear trap that continued into a Black Monday bear trap? 

Combining the Wyckoff method with Elliot's wave theory suggests that Monday will be a continuation wave of Fridays loss followed by a wave up on Tuesday. Tuesday's wave up is in large part due to the Korean cash injection via currency swap (fancy word for a loan) and the re-balancing of portfolios at the end of Q1.

This is a good time to take advantage of short term SPY options expiring on 3/31 &amp; 4/1 as well as IWM options expiring on 3/31.

Monday: Sell Puts for profit then.... SPY $265c 3/31 &amp; 4/1; IWM $115c 3/31.

frcuzr,Variation-Separate,Order 66: The Revenge of the Bears,"**I. Is the Rally Over?**

The bear market rally is gaining exhaustion. During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, markets fell from 116.79 on SPY to 80.63, representing a decline of \~31%. This year, we reached ATH on SPY at 338.34 and bounced, closing at 222.95, representing a retrace of \~34%. Curiously enough, if you look at the first major decline in 1929, the first drop was also \~34%.

There's a few things to note: the time it took from ATH to our temporary bottom was 23 days. During the reflexive or relief rally, we closed at 261.2 on Thursday, which is a rebound of 17% based on the close.

The time it took to rally was 3 days. What do these numbers mean? In just 13% of the time it took for our decline, we rebounded almost 20%. What about Friday? We had a significant decline, most likely as firms and funds did not want to hold positions over the weekend resulting in selling.

[SPY 1 Yr\/1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/inzw8a5mwnp41.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04cc9dbeda986d4be850fb84930e1197b66696b)

What about the volume? Selling volume rapidly increased, peaking near a volume of 400 million shares which corresponded to a temporary bounce. Selling volume decreased before peaking once more at 400 million shares until it eventually subsided at 218.26. What happened to the buying volume during the rally? We peaked on Wednesday. Buying volume has declined rapidly from Thursday and Friday as shown in the blue circle.

**II. The Case for Climbing Higher**

After passing the senate vote for the stimulus bill, the market rallied through the afternoon on Thursday before hitting a wall at 259. It stayed almost completely flat, where at this point, a large battle was playing out to contest the direction of the market. Was the stimulus bill enough to push the rally higher and break past 265 to eventually open 269 and even 300? We had an eye popping push to 263 in nearly the last minute of trading.

[SPY 10 D\/30 min](https://preview.redd.it/ylt9ob273op41.png?width=1968&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23fc07869de1b949c43582dc11c987d9e4be0c96)

Friday, the stimulus bill passed and we began retracing to the highs of yesterday. Ultimately, we never got there and most buyers sold off into the weekend. But WSB cries out, ""it's a bullish engulfing candle""! Let's take a look at some other evidence.

**III. Dark Pools and Gamma Exposure**

While the actions of market participants may be obscured, the actions of MM will follow a certain predictable pattern. In the case of an institution purchasing a collar, short OTM puts are offset with the sale of a long OTM call. On the other hand of this transaction is a MM who sells the short OTM put and purchases the long OTM call.

[GEX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/xy1r4d474op41.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=119dc2b06002ab6862e73893d23969808b80cd83)

When people are scrambling to purchase options to hedge, this is reflected in two areas. One is in volatility, which is more of a reflection for the *expected* demand of options 1 month out (this is a great simplification). The other is in gamma exposure, or GEX as given by Squeezemetrics. In this case, net gamma exposure will dramatically decrease as the selling of put options results in negative gamma for MM. These positions need to be delta hedged due to an imbalance of the gamma. This is a little counterintuitive, but during negative gamma exposure, MM actually contribute towards selling (delta hedging) since gamma becomes lower once an OTM put becomes ITM and simultaneously increasing expected volatility.

What happens when the gamma flips, and MM are instead long gamma? In other words, what happens when there is less demand for hedging and instead firms are purchasing short OTM calls and selling long OTM puts? MM on the other side of the trade now purchase more long calls and have increased, positive gamma. To counteract this positive gamma, MM actively start buying shares (delta hedging) to reduce this gamma exposure, especially if the stock price starts declining, limiting more downside.

[DIX in orange, SPX in blue](https://preview.redd.it/zt0zgzv54op41.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513ebd20beac85d1ec3c1dd51d80001d0fd6a167)

This can be reflected in the amount of trading within dark pools. For example, prior to the gamma flip, net gamma exposure was highly positive. During the first wave of selling, net gamma exposure was positive. After the gamma flip, dark pool activity significantly increased as MM subsequently needed to delta hedge their positions by increasing selling into the market as well. As selling leveled off at the bottom, gamma again flipped to positive, corresponding to huge increases in dark pool activity increased. From Squeezemetrics,

&gt;Very high relative percentages (‚â•45%) of dollar-weighted short volume (DIX) are associated with mean 60-market-day returns of 5.3%.

GEX has flipped to negative once more, and DIX appears to be losing momentum. The next few days will be interesting to see what the trends really are.

**IV. Summary**

What about commodities such as gold and oil? What about volatility? What about options flows? I've talked at length in my previous posts at what to look at and what I have observed. I leave it to you guys to take a look and figure them out.

**tl;dr Possibility of climbing higher to retest 265 as money flows back in, along with final EOM rebalancing. Drop imminent.**

**tl;dr of tl;dr bears have smaller DIX.**",8636,1585514361,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frcuzr/order_66_the_revenge_of_the_bears/,wallstreetbets,506
frctlg,Redice_was_taken,Bank missing liquidity?,Everybody know that bank have a lot of companies as clients and they have to pay interest on their loan. Recently due to covid-19 we have seen a lot of companies requesting moratorium. So they basically are going to pay nothing or the interest but if they dont get paid the bank will not have liquidity and they wont be able to pay for customer investments like in their savings account or investment in the bank. I can see the banks falling soon. Maybe not but at the moment i think banks are trying to avoid this and are trying to hide this.,50,1585514226,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frctlg/bank_missing_liquidity/,wallstreetbets,0

frcp5o,ThislsMyAccount22,I had a dream!,"Had an incredibly vivid dream and I intend on acting on it. 

1. WWE drops to $26
I know this is a decent drop from the current position. WWE has the Network which is a constant monthly revenue stream. Although, they aren‚Äôt running house shows or other arena shows (are Wrestlemania) and this is a big chunk of their projected revenue. Their top drAw just removed himself from Mania because of health factors. Other wrestlers (Mike Mizanin and Dana Brooke) were sent home because they were ill. All Vince McMahon needs is one of his employees to really fall ill and weekly tv may come to halt. Also Vince just sold a ton of stock to help cover costs while WWE is essentially closed to the public. I rode WWE down from the $40 range to $30 then took tendies. 
Chances of this coming to fruition: 79%

2. Apple drops nearly 50% in stock price. 
I‚Äôm currently holding 1/2021 $250c and maybe I was just paranoid about the potential double circuit breaker tomorrow, who knows. Maybe I‚Äôll look into AAPL $150p over the next few months. Most of Apple‚Äôs products (if not all, do the DD yourself. This is a shitpost) are made in China. There could be a big hit coming along with the rest of the market? I‚Äôd imagine AAPL next earnings call won‚Äôt be overly positive. Either way, I don‚Äôt think it will drop that low, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money off it.

3. $30,000
I kept seeing this number. $30,000, over and over again in my dream. My personal investing account is around 14k so I‚Äôm not sure what 30k is alluding to. Maybe that‚Äôs the amount I‚Äôll make off those potential 5/15 AAPL $150p that I‚Äôll look into tomorrow. Whatever. 

TL/DR it‚Äôs not worth reading. Joe Exotic is a fucking nut.

frcoco,Dalton_Evans,"First Up, Second Down","As the title implies we‚Äôve just finished our first upswing during this bear market and are about to head into our second downward swing, which should last through April. Expect a lot of volatility with some bear/bull traps sprinkled in. 2008 had something like 6 different swings of 8-20% before we hit bottom. (I know 2020 isn‚Äôt 2008, I‚Äôm just trying to make a point. If anything this mirrors 1973s bear market pretty damn closely.)

What to look for: If the SPX daily close is below ~2,495 this week, look to test the ~2,365 level followed by ~2,200. It may seem like forever but a week ago we were at those levels.

Friday closed at ~2,540 as we approached the ~2,600 support level into the close. That was everyone collecting their profits from the 18% move during the week.

There is a chance we gap up to ~2,650 and even ~2,800 in the next 1-2 weeks before we bottom. I won‚Äôt be making any moves until late Tuesday/early Wednesday as I expect a lot to become clear following EOM/EOQ.

TL;DR - SPY puts / VIX calls. 1-2 week expiry and hedge your fucking bets with 3-4 week plays, idiots. 

Tonight the futures limit down. Ban me if I‚Äôm wrong. Now that I have to sort through dozens of bullshit posts to find anything worthwhile and we‚Äôre about to be hit with a wave of Barstool douche bags, I‚Äôd be OK with it.

TL;DR

Most countries are severely under-reporting the amount of cases/deaths for various reasons. Some are manipulating the cause of death to pneumonia and other false causes. Some are intentionally hiding the key facts.  

Once the true key factors are released, their already depressed indexes will plummet even further. Find the appropriate instruments and go short.

All I need from you autists is a strike price and a sell to close price between 200 and 300 in forms of X/Y. Since no one has a fucking clue how we open Monday, tonight as good as it gets to test this theory on SPY.

If we get fair amount of posts, I will then calculate the numbers (2am Eastern last count), post the results and buy a contract worth minimum of $3K and maximum of $5K expiring May 1st when market opens. Obviously, I will buy a call option if the number is above Friday‚Äôs close and put option if it‚Äôs below. When or if the sell to close price hits, I‚Äôll sell the contract and donate half the earnings to a charity, updating the post with screen shots along the way.

fras4l,Global-Quiet,Don't be left holding the bag,"I've noticed a trend of posts which can basically be reduced to be ""it's bad, so let's short"".  I'd suggest that we should go beyond this type of analysis to not get caught holding the bag.  In short, the outright level of ""how bad it is"" isn't what drives markets in the long run - it's the *trend* of the data which matters most.

For example, here's the 2008-2009 crash and recovery.

[https://imgur.com/XEDb7hn](https://imgur.com/XEDb7hn)

Those who were short simply because unemployment was rising had the market go upwards of 40% against their trades at the end of the trend.

But if you had instead used the *rate of change* of unemployment, you would have been long several months earlier.  You may have had a losing trade or two along the way, but would have captured the ultimate turn in the market very near the bottom.

[https://imgur.com/0A9WE12](https://imgur.com/0A9WE12)

The point is this: think beyond the headline figures.  Ask if the trend is accelerating or decelerating and use that as your baseline market bias. You'll be miles ahead of the average trader.

TLDR - The market generally doesn't care of it's bad or not, it cares what direction the data is moving.",133,1585507189,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fras4l/dont_be_left_holding_the_bag/,wallstreetbets,53

fradqs,SpliffMaster489,Banks are trading well below book value,"As you all know the market has been acting strange lately.  In fact, things haven't been this volatile since my wife's boyfriend got mad at me for not cleaning my dishes.  It seems like the market is no longer willing to put debt out of their minds and are now starting to price it in.  How can we tell?   
 Well, we can look at the book value of certain banks with a lot of exposure to the debt market and compare it with what the market thinks these shares are worth.  Book value is the total equity (assets minus liabilities) of a company divided by the total number of shares of that company.  So, in a sense, the book value is exactly what your stake in the company should be worth.  If the market is trading above book value it means most have faith that the company will grow or they believe in its brand.  On the other hand, especially for banks, if the market is trading  below book value then investors think assets are understated or liabilities are overstated.  With that in mind lets look at market value divided by book value (based on December 2019 earnings) of Citigroup and Wells Fargo:

&amp;#x200B;

Citigroup: 0.49

Wells Fargo: 0.76

&amp;#x200B;

Now SPX is only down about 25% since December and both of these banks have small stakes in equities so I don't think that alone solves the balance sheet mystery.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since citigroup is trading 50% below book value, investors really aren't buying Citigroup's balance sheet.  Here is their earnings report from December

 [https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer419s.pdf?ieNocache=264](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/investor/data/qer419s.pdf?ieNocache=264) 

on page 3 we see that they have a total of 400 billion in corporate loans and 300 billion in consumer loans out of 2 trillion in total assets.  Since they are trading at 50% book value, the market is basically pricing these loans at much less than half their value.  Now compare this with Wells Fargo:

 [https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2019-earnings.pdf](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/earnings/fourth-quarter-2019-earnings.pdf) 

on page 28 we can see that about half of their assets (1 trillion) are in loans and yet their book value is at 0.76.  

All this, I believe, supports my claim that corporate and consumer debt isn't as valuable as before and that there is some price discovery out there.  

Here is the debt/equity ratio of some big companies (negative means more liabilities than assets)

McDonalds: -6.54

Boeing: -2.4

Goldman Sachs: 1.9

GE: 2.36

Disney: 0.5

  Boeing has already been hammered into the ground so I'm not sure if there is much of a short opportunity left, however, note that McDonalds has much more of a debt burden and is only down 13% from last year.  Thus it's very possible this debt hasn't been priced in.  Some might argue that the markets are all knowing and efficient.  To that I will give the following joke,

&amp;#x200B;

two economists walk down the road.  One says, ""look!  There's a $20 bill on the ground.""  The other says, ""that can't be a real $20 bill because if it was then someone would have already picked it up.""  

&amp;#x200B;

  Right now all my money is tied up selling Disney vertical call spreads but I'll be adding some short delta to $MCD soon.  My suggestion is call credit spreads with a month till expiration.  I the stock gets within 50 cents of your short strike roll it out a week or two to collect extra premium and then wait it out.  The width should be about 2 strikes wide so you can collect more if it drops significantly.  I don't want to buy puts because this whole thing is a long shot and I want to be able to recover my money if McDonalds suddenly pulls through.  I hope to hear some counter arguments below.",126,1585505758,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fradqs/banks_are_trading_well_below_book_value/,wallstreetbets,30

fra6vo,smacksaw,"Could Netflix come out of this smelling like a rose? With no ability to produce new shows through borrowing money, do they run out of content long-term or get closer to breaking even?","I wanted to get some opinions and maybe some data on this from y'all.

I think the theory works out like this:

Netflix is $16bn in the hole and has been borrowing heavily to make as much content as possible. They are trying to bet on their library. They think that if they build a library that is huge, the money they spend now becomes profit later because you are buying the library. 

Some validation for this theory is the appeal of HBO Now, which has an extensive back catalogue that makes it very worthwhile in the eyes of the consumer and the pundit. The main selling point is the strength of the catalogue. 

Netflix seemed to realise this as they began to understand their access to non-Netflix content could be limited. 

The danger, of course, was that they borrowed heavily against their future to do this.

The downside for them is that with nothing new coming in the pipeline, they are looking at a gap in new shows. 3 months? 6 months? 18 months? They won't have any self-generated content and things that are ""almost finished"" could never be finished if people die, move on, things change, etc. Shows they've invested in may never pan out. They could have only completed 80% of each of 10 episodes, leaving all 10 unusable.

People could get tired of Netflix because there's nothing new. 

Could this burn them? Are we more interested in foreign content now? Do they keep spending, but buying/licencing foreign media? Is there a bidding war for foreign content? Does it come on the cheap as companies try to licence their shows for anything as they face a crunch? Do we all migrate to YouTube and Twitch?

The reason I'm interested in some data is that this seems unprecedented, but I'm not sophisticated or educated enough to know if there are any parallels in the market from the past.

So, are you betting for or against Netflix?",60,1585505098,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fra6vo/could_netflix_come_out_of_this_smelling_like_a/,wallstreetbets,13

fr9fd6,hungryakl,"The maturity wall, again","Judging by the quality of your posts, most of you retards hit a personal maturity wall somewhere around 9 years old. Well, guess what, some of the world's biggest businesses are about to hit their own maturity walls and they might not get past it either.

In 2020 (and continuing to 2023) the market will see record levels of spec-grade (ie. junk) bonds expiring.

What happens when bonds expire? The company must pay them back in full.

What if they don't have the cash? They raise more cash by taking out new debt.

What if they can't take out any new debt because homie bit the bat in China and now all their stores are closed and their staff are laid off? Well, then they're fucked.

Big brain investors have been worrying about this for years, before the economy had even thought about shitting the bed.

From 2016: ‚ÄúIssuers with low speculative-grade ratings of ‚ÄòB-‚Äò or lower could find current market conditions difficult. By sector, we believe the commodity-exposed sectors of oil and gas and metals, mining, and steel likely will face continued challenges as volatile commodity prices contribute to elevated negative biases ‚Ä¶‚Äù  That was when oil was $43 a barrel.

From 2019: ""As a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the event of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality deteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were sufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for greater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that could, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy.""

From 2019: ""In the next downturn, many bonds in the BBB-category will transition to junk, and many junk bonds but also some investment-grade bonds ‚Äì if the past is any guide ‚Äì will transition to default. Two-notch downgrades are not uncommon: one day you wake up, and your ‚ÄúBBB‚Äù investment-grade bond is a ‚ÄúBB+‚Äù junk bond.""

From 20 Jan 2020: ""Moody‚Äôs is concerned, however, that declining credit quality in speculative-grade debt ‚Äúpoints to potentially higher defaults during the next downturn.‚Äù The $750 billion, five-year maturity window for leveraged loans and revolving credit facilities grew 27% from last year's five-year outlook, and is at its highest level since Moody‚Äôs began tracking those number""

&amp;#x200B;

[Fig 2. Note how many issuers were sitting on the edge of junk territory with a BBB rating](https://preview.redd.it/gt7koxxs2np41.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbc02347160fb2f8978016b317c8eddaa4b49605)

So, a lot of shitty debt is coming due soon, and a lot of ""not shit"" debt may actually be shit too. This might not be a problem if business was booming; we've seen maturity walls come and go before. But we're seeing the house of junk start to crumble. Ford, previously at BBB- was [downgraded to junk last week](https://www.ft.com/content/95035b47-f4ab-479e-a79c-2d0d981e658f). How do you think that will impact their ability to take out debt? How would that effect their share price? Their last resort is to issue new shares, further lowering the share price, or pray for another bailout. It's not looking good.

At this point you should be thinking ""how do I find other shitters like Ford?"" and this is how: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/finder](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/finder)

You want to look for bonds expiring in the next year or two, with low ratings / high yield.

I found examples like Gamestop, Tupperware, Hertz. I considered how their business might be faring at present. I wondered if their rating would go up or down. I thought ""puts"".

fr9cnr,LAXtoHNL,Can Hawai‚Äôi Survive?,"After a couple of weeks of trying to determine who will be hit hardest by the beer flu, I now feel that Hawai‚Äôi is beyond fucked.

Having been to Hawai‚Äôi numerous times, I cannot imagine how Hawai‚Äôi recovers.  There are virtually no flights going to Hawaii, Hawaiian Airlines is all but grounded, 80-90% of their economy is tourism related, hotels are &lt;10% occupancy, the overwhelming majority of their restaurants cater to tourists, their stadium parking lots are is a graveyard for rental cars that nobody is renting, and estimate the number of ‚Äúessential businesses‚Äù on the islands to be in the single digits.  

I believe this, in many ways, is welcoming to the locals.  Tourists for years have continued to desecrate the islands, and with the ongoing battle regarding Mauna Kea, for many, less people coming to Hawai‚Äôi, the better.  Unfortunately, I estimate people in Hawai‚Äôi live paycheck to paycheck more than anywhere else in America.  With tourism at a standstill for the foreseeable future, and an economy that will take years for them to recover, the number of pregnancies, addictions, and homeless will skyrocket. Also set to skyrocket will be the number of defaults on credit cards, loans, and mortgages.

TL:DR- Hawai‚Äôi is shut down and in all likelihood fucked beyond repair.

fr78dp,InvesticenterBlowie,"Goldilocks and the 5 bulls: a ""just right"" explanation of Implied Volatility","No, this isn't about that Piper Perri scene you watched last night.

I've seen a lot of explanations of implied volatility (IV) recently, but they were all either too long, too short, or not enough detail. This is going to be just right for your smooth brains to understand. 

**TL;DR** Why is it called implied volatility? Because it is the expected future volatility *implied by* the current option price. This TL;DR is fake. Read the example:

Imagine a world where SPCE stock currently trades at $100 (stop drooling) and 1 year from now, there are only two outcomes in the world: SPCE changes by 10% up or down (**the expected volatility**). Goes to $90 or $110. It's a coin flip. Given interest rates are zero and SPCE doesn't pay a dividend, $100 is a fair price given these expected values `(50% * $90 + 50% * $110 = $100)`. What should the price of a $100 SPCE call option expiring 1 year from now be?

* SPCE goes to $90 in a year: call option is worth $0 at expiration
* SPCE goes to $110 in a year: call option is worth $10 at expiration

It's a coin flip, right? So the expected (average) value is: `$0 * 50% + $10 * 50% = $5`. If you don't know why the call options are worth $0 and $10 at expiration, fuck off.

What if you or the market expected the future prices of SPCE to be higher and lower than the previous example (**more volatile**)? What if expected volatility was 20% and the future states were $80 or $120? Same price today of $100.

* SPCE goes to $80 in a year: call option is still worth $0 at expiration
* SPCE goes to $120 in a year: call option is now worth $20 at expiration

Same coin flip: `$0 * 50% + $20 * 50% = $10`. And just like that (I'm sure the Bulls said that to Piper a few times), the increase in expected level of future volatility made the option worth more, even though the underlying stock price did not change.

*But InvesticenterBlowie, you said this was about implied volatility and you blabbered on about expected volatility and this is too long already.*

OK zoomer, let's wrap it up (like I wish your dad did): we know everything about the option when we view it in the broker platform: strike, expiration, put or call, underlying price, and option price (**the only thing changing here**). We can look up the dividend and the risk free rate. If we have an option valuation model at our disposal (which we do, Black Scholes Merton or otherwise), we can work backwards from all the given information and compute the expected volatility. That's why it's called *implied* volatility. IV is embedded and linked to the price of the option; it is the future expected volatility *implied by* the current option price.

Positions: [https://imgur.com/a/IfEAlDA](https://imgur.com/a/IfEAlDA) a mess of puts entered over time (averaged into IWM) when IV was high, expecting it to go higher. Trying to hedge with some bull put spreads recently thinking that IV will stay medium-to-high and the puts will pan out over time (""alles in Ordnung"" point for your Downfall memes).",52,1585494319,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr78dp/goldilocks_and_the_5_bulls_a_just_right/,wallstreetbets,1

WFT does this even mean?

18854 is a not a large number but ~9000 are a LOT of positives.

Have they given up on the South Korea model already? Because they already know the situation(SNAFU?) well so there's no need for proactive testing? So they are only doing case-by-case diagnostic testing from now on?

Also WFT is this 50%? So if you live in NYC area and have flu-lick symptoms then your chance of COVID-19 is 50-50? Are we at this point already?

Plus Trump and Cuomo already rejected the Wuhan model, then that basically leaves NYC on the trajectory of a runaway?

fr5q76,oskarege,"Keep an eye on Sweden‚Äôs Corona response, they might be into something.","So Sweden has chosen not to close the country down. Schools up to high schools are still open, all the stores are open and people are going about their lives. There are restrictions on how many can gather (50 currently) and other things in place. People are asked to work from home, any symptoms and you are forced by colleagues to go home and not return until you are symptom free + 2 days. But overall we have been extremely relaxed about forceful measures. We are essentially relying on norms changing. 

And there is a stated goal that we are not trying to stop the spread, just slow it down enough.

Our case numbers are rising fairly slow but that is due to a really restrictive testing regimen. 

Hospitalizations and deaths on the other hand.. I have been skeptical about this plan for obvious reasons but apparently the number of new hospitalizations are slowing and we had no new deaths yesterday compared to the exponential growth in the days before. This decline seem to coincide well with our stricter measures.

**This is obviously waaay to early to call victory but I would keep a very close eye out for what happens in Sweden.**

For now most people take it somewhat seriously in smaller towns; cafes are open, bars half full (only sitting by tables), distancing in stores are enacted. But overall life goes on. The bigger- harder hit - cities are more careful. 

I really don‚Äôt know. It sounds overly optimistic but if it works it would quickly become a road map for other countries.  


On the flip side there are tons of issues here; we are not ramping up production of PPE nearly enough. I‚Äôd love to see wide access to masks. We are also horribly slow at expanding testing capacity, I would at least want to know if I‚Äôve had it and could start going about my life normally again. Voices from opposition parties are being raised to address this.

fr5mhz,GildedCodpiece,Why there's loads more downside,"Up until now there have been absolutely wild swings in the market as participants try to re-price publicly-traded assets with little more to go on than fear and guesstimates. 

Next month, the fundamentals start to come in. So what should we expect? Microsoft has said they are expecting a 2%-3% decline in revenue. I think that‚Äôs bullshit personally. Morgan Stanley and Goldman estimate we will see more like a 20-30% decline in GDP by mid-year. 

I'm too retarded and lazy to figure out what that means for corporate earnings exactly, but it‚Äôs a lot. Def. more than 2-3%. 

Right now the Shiller P/E ratio is about 24. That‚Äôs still nine points above the historical median (where stocks are more or less fairly priced) of 15. In fact, there are only two periods in our history that the Shiller P/E was meaningfully higher than it is EVEN NOW: the 1929 crash and the dot com bubble-GFC. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](tm25dnki0mp41)

So let‚Äôs go conservative and say the denominator in that ratio turns out to be 5% overvalued after Q1 earnings and will continue to decline as long as the crisis continues. Well perhaps the P/E is even a few points higher. In a crash, it always drops once the bubble pops and sentiment turns to panic. And almost always ends up below that 15-point median. It certainly never *recovers* in a recession until the worst has passed. But it might LOOK like it's climbing if lower earnings doesn't translate into a SIGNIFICANT drop in stock prices after Q1 earnings come out. 

And none of us autists are retarded enough to think we'll be seeing a slue of outperforms. Thus, sell, sell, sell.

All that translates into stocks being overvalued even now. And *bigly overvalued* in an *obvious* and measurable way once earnings start coming in. 

So stonks go down. Really how much they go down depends on Washington's response. Damage will be limited if they bring all the Governors and health agencies together in an intelligent (lol), coordinated (lol), and effective (lol) containment strategy. But, seeing as the administration avoided expanding testing for the first two months of the budding crisis for the sake of some numbers, I'm not holding my breath (except when I leave home. Which I don't because I'm in NJ and it's a goddamn nightmare here). And thus, corporate earnings suffer all the more.

And when we're talking about fundamentals, my fellow retards, we're talking about price and we're talking about earnings. And it also looks like Orange Man's planning to just, you know, [take that $500b](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/trump-signing-statement-coronavirus.html) that was supposed to prop up the economy anyway.

in depth discussion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast)

The U.S. business cycles that ended in the last three recessions involved progressively greater and more troubling risk-taking behavior. Each ended with worse financial fallout and a longer period of recession and weak recovery. Much has been written about the bubbles leading up to the commercial real estate deflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the crash of the tech stocks and the ensuing bear market of 2000-2002, and the deflation of home real estate and the debacle in mortgage-backed derivatives in 2006 through 2011. Yet analyses of the bubbles‚Äô causes invariably omit a critical point.

*The evolution of the economy‚Äôs aggregate financial structure has, over decades, altered the playing field for financial decision makers throughout the economy, increasingly skewing their available options toward higher risks, lower returns, or both.*

This paper presents two facts that help explain economic and financial performance in recent decades and offers insights into the current business cycle, the 2020s, and beyond.

1. Private sector balance sheets grew faster than income over many decades; thus, aggregate debt grew faster than aggregate income, and aggregate assets grew faster than aggregate income.
2. This disproportionate balance sheet expansion changed financial parameters in the economy, mathematically making financial activity increasingly hazardous and compelling riskier behavior.

The first of these statements is an empirical observation, easily documented. The second is the result of direct logical deduction. Together, they have several consequences:

* From the mid-1980s on‚Äî*the era of the Big Balance Sheet Economy*‚Äîfinancial decision makers have had to choose between progressively lower returns and higher risk.
* Too much private sector debt relative to income has adverse consequences, of course, but so does an excessive total value of private sector assets relative to income. An extreme value of aggregate assets relative to income means meager yields and operating returns on assets, distorted financial decisions, and an economy vulnerable to asset price deflation.
* Each successive business cycle in the Big Balance Sheet Economy era has started with proportionately larger balance sheets and has involved more reckless balance sheet expansion leading to even bigger balance sheets and a worse financial crisis.
* Each successive crisis, with more bloated balance sheets to stabilize, was more difficult to resolve and therefore required the government to engineer dramatic new lows in interest rates, heavy fiscal stimulus, and other measures to stabilize economic conditions. The measures eventually overcame recession and chronic weakness, but in doing so they necessarily caused further expansion of balance sheets relative to income.
* During the 2000s, either the housing bubble or some other set of highly speculative, excessively risky, and destabilizing activities was virtually inevitable.
* Increasingly unsound risk taking has been occurring again in the 2010s.
* The present cycle is almost certain to end badly. Although there are signs that balance sheet ratios are undergoing an extended, secular topping process, they remain extreme and will produce serious financial instability during the next recession.
* There is no nice, neat solution to the Big Balance Sheet Economy dilemma, no blueprint for a politically acceptable resolution. The task of preserving prosperity while shrinking assets-to-income and debt-to-income ratios is, if not outright paradoxical, at least plagued by conflicting forces.
* Government policy cannot prevent serious consequences when the Big Balance Sheet Economy corrects, but it can moderate them and help households, businesses, and the financial system cope with them. However, these tasks would be difficult, politically tricky, and prone to cause some backtracking on balance sheet correction even if policymakers fully understood the economic problem.
* Although the outlook is fraught with uncertainties, individuals and organizations can benefit by taking steps to prepare for, endure, and in some cases capitalize on some of the developments ahead.

The U.S. economy continues to face a bubble-or-nothing outlook. Participants in the economy and markets will keep increasing their financial risk until the expansion breaks down, and the bigger the balance sheets are relative to income, the more severe the breakdown is likely to be.",85,1585484169,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr50y8/the_economic_cause_and_consequences_of_the/,wallstreetbets,1

Despite the business model, ma y of these firms have been dropping alongside the downward market pressure. I‚Äôm making a bet that these firms over perform come earnings season with one of their most profitable quarters ever.

The beer flu is the best thing that could have ever happened to UBER and LYFT. Why? They lose money with every ride! So, how are they even a thing then? They are trying to control market share while automated cars get developed and approved. Their valuation is 100% brand and market share. Everything else, like driving people around burns investment money. 

The self drive car tech is still going forward despite the beer flu. However UBER and LYFT get to pause the bleeding. Uncle Sam is paying the drivers extra to sit on their ass! The market share is not going anywhere, as who is going to try and take it while beer flu is going on? Also will states keep going after them for labor laws? Nope, they will love it if they hire people at all...

They all seem to have enough cash to wait this out (over a year) so long term I think they will be fine. Yes they will follow the market but if it goes low enough I might even buy a few stocks. So don't expect them to go to 0.

fr3jk0,daddydickie,Owens and Minors (Medical PPE) working with the US government.,"&amp;#x200B;

**Interview with Cramer** 

It happened on Friday evening, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAqPQKBXkWc).

**Summary** \- taken from the video and a bit of other sources (their website..etc)

There are many corona virus stocks out there but I think this one stands out. 

1. The CEO revealed that they are working with the US government. At the moment only large cap companies like MMM are known to be doing so. Being a small cap company the revenue from PPE (personal protective equipment) is going to increase OMI's value substantially.
2. The market showed interest immediately after the Cramer show. Stock price went up 23.6% in AH immediately after interview.
3. This company has distribution centers in the US and Europe for exporting medical supplies. 
4. Manufacturing done in America! No supply chain issues. Other competitors who manufacture in China saw their production shut down due to the Lunar New Year and beyond due to the virus. 

**The Company**

Owens and Minor ($OMI) is a global manufacturing and distributing medical supply company with offices in the US and Europe. They make masks and gloves and other crap that helps in the beer flu crisis. Their CEO, Ed Pesicka, originally an executive from Thermal Fisher (TMO), joined Owens and Minor about a year ago. He's been fixing the customer service which bled the company for years. He's been restructuring the company for the past 9-10 months back to industry standard. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Ed Pesicka is getting results.

**Meeting Demand**

Ed sees mask demand in NYC raise from 20k to 200k-300k per week in just one hospital. The company is ramped up production to meet demands in medical protective gear. From January to end of February there was an increase of 50 million masks per month. They are **working closely with the FEMA, the white house team, and HHS**.

There will be a substantial increase in demand. CDC guidance on masks expected to [change](https://twitter.com/DrMattMcCarthy/status/1243891663162019841) in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.

**Exporting**

They seem to be in a position to sell masks to Europe as well as they have distribution centers there. Trump keeps saying we can sell ventilators to Europe. Why not sell other flu gear as well?

60+ of their distribution centers are located in the US, with 11 in [Europe](https://www.owens-minor.com/our-solutions/distribution-and-warehousing/). Logistics already in place for exporting.

**Comparing with other corona virus stocks**

The advantage of OMI over other similar stocks like APT is that we know they're working with the US government. Like MMM, but with a much smaller market cap. The revenue from the increased demand will make this stock undervalued. 

**Possible Future Catalysts**

1.  Change in CDC guidance. Americans wearing masks everyday.
2. Name called by Mike Pence just like MMM! There will be a much more significant effect due to the market cap size.
3. Earnings in two months. Expect it to beat EPS by a large margin due to the January to February ramp up with a very good guidance.

**Magical Technical**

1. This stock has not gone parabolic like the others like APT, CODX have. Still cheap!
2. Blew away several resistance levels in AH after interview with Cramer - $6, $6.5, $7. Bounced off at $7.8
3. Break out above resistance at $7.8, HUGE gap up to about $17. Now at 6.81.
4. Comparing how much other small cap virus stocks have performed, this will jump to $15-$20 and falls back to about $10 (like the others). The size of the gap also suggests a jump of that size. 

TL:DR - $10 calls.",80,1585475815,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr3jk0/owens_and_minors_medical_ppe_working_with_the_us/,wallstreetbets,1

fr31jv,Rabbitloki,The Obvious put? - Someone's gotta be the target,"With the market once more heading into retreat one should ask yourself... who is the next OBVIOUS but not EASILY picked biggest loser.

Having completed this exercise with a merry band of cutthroat investing pirates we quickly removed the first (raw goods) and secondary sectors (manufacturing) and moved to the tertiary business sector (Services).

Now many of these service industries already have been punished especially the obvious customer facing companies such as Hotels, Travel, Transportation, etc.  In discussions it became obvious that while there where many smaller companies to consider it was more interesting looking for a darling company.  One that had sufficient cash flows, likely to survive, but was being propped up by an overly enthusiastic marketplace unwilling to easily jump on and start beating the company for being overvalued.

This led to Microsoft... Why this tech giant?  

1) Predictable client behavior

2) Predictable Business behavior

3) Predictable market reaction

We are heading into a recession, and you'd have to be an alleged ostrich lover not to concur with this viewpoint.  Hence the following MS Client truths - 

1) People will be making technology work longer than normal as job losses deter people from purchasing new windows and office based products the continued lifeblood of MS business

2) Businesses will be reducing their licensing where possible and their cloud spend as quickly as they can to reduce overall expenditures

Microsoft of course will react as they have in past recessions which is buckle down, look for companies to purchase on the cheap, and negotiate with the clients to ensure longer agreements in exchange for immediate reductions.  This however will be a longer term play and unlikely to hit the 4/22 earnings report.  A report that coincides nicely with the exponential impact of Covid-19 fatalities and infections and demands an outlook adjustment for 2020.  Very predictable and very certain.

Lastly, Microsoft's position as a component of the major indices ensures that they will go down with the remainder of the ship... but how far, how will the market react?

That's the convenient part of this analysis that we saw... was that Microsoft has had a nice predictable floor of around $135 for the last two drops...  and if we're coming into another drop then falling past this $135 floor is a certainty if the rest of the market goes down.

So we have logical client behavior, logical business behavior, and likely market behavior... In short... this is likely to be just to obvious to work.  \*Note already bought these positions on Friday mid day... so would I buy more on Monday - Yes, if we go green for even a moment.

There's your play... all hypothetical logic based on consumer sentiments... In other words... this is probably a horrible plan.

Many of you on this sub are like

**""So much bad news, but market go up! More coronavirus cases and unemployment but puts no printo wahhh wahhh! Surely will print""**

Remember that the market is forward looking. For the same reason that TSLA can skyrocket to $1000 while barely posting a profit in a quarter and Uber can be worth fucking anything at all despite never have made a profit in their lives, the market could go green right now and we could've bottomed.

Quarantined cities?  **PRICED IN**

1 million cases? **PRICED IN** 

Dysfunctional hospitals? **PRICED IN**

20% unemployment? **PRICED IN**

30% GDP reduction? **PRICED IN**

Given how america is trending everyone and their mom can figure out where we're going. Many people expect a swift recovery to this situation. That's what the market is pricing in. If you have 4/17 SPY PUTS but are also waiting to buy SPY CALLS like 6-12 months out after, you're exactly the autist the market is pricing in for. You think the market is just going to go down on you and give it to you exactly how you like it?

Now it's about what's unexpected. Is Russia going to bomb NY to try to cure coronavirus? Will all flights globally be banned indefinitely? This is the news that will change the market.

Literally WSB made a thread trying to count unemployment from every state a day before the report released. Are fucking kidding me? Is that our idea of DD? You don't think every MM can add up some fucking numbers in an excel sheet? They probably knew these numbers a month ago; a year ago; before you were born.

TLDR Fact of the matter is this:

If you think that the economy is going to suffer damage lasting 3-5 years **AND** you think that these next 1-2 months will give us enough information to make that judgement call, then fuck yeah YOLO PUTS.

![video](1sybey8vxjp41)

Long time lurker here... wasn't going to post but due to how salty a recent autist got about needing more ""proof"" when seeing other people have huge gains while seeing his gf get buttfucked by me has led me to do this

**Story:** Started investing with 9k about 6 months ago, was a permabull and able to build it up to 50k before getting fucked by the beer virus. Immediately switched to being a gay bear which led me to get massive gains that is almost the same size as my pp. 

**TL;DR:** Converted about $20k into $2M in about 3 weeks, and then proceeded to lose about $1.5M in about a week lol (I withdrew $150k so add that to all my positions)

**Positions:** ALL IN SPY PUTS 4/20 $240p

Why these positions? Well 4/20 for obvious reasons and 240 cause RIP kobe

**TL;DR;DR:** In true WSB fashion, I yolo myself to massive gains, and then continued to yolo myself into losing almost all of it... mod me now",0,1585462798,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr198r/9k_2m_650k_in_the_most_autistic_way_possible/,wallstreetbets,1

But I'm not sold on the idea that everything that could ever possibly happen is already priced in, and here's why.

The outbreak in China [blew up in late January](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/). Italy [started going to hell around early March](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/). Considering that the year is 2020 and airplanes and boats exist, we **knew** this was coming to the USA. In fact, [we knew it on January 21](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html).

Why didn't Wall Street react sooner? Shouldn't they have seen the writing on the wall? Is the market's magic crystal ball only able predict two weeks into the future? Is it unable to browse r/coronavirus like the rest of us? Did JP's quants suddenly forget how exponential growth works?

I get that the market will price in predictable events like massive unemployment numbers, a $2T stimulus package, and even taint-scorching QE. Any chimp with an RH account could have seen that shit coming.

But you have to remember that the market is made up of people, and many of these people are old, stupid, and don't spend 14 hours a day on the internet like we do. They are used to a world in which each week is roughly the same as the week before. They haven't been reading the horror stories from Italian nurses that we've all seen. They don't beat off to the rising numbers on www.infection2020.com like you sick fucks. Sure, they know it's bad, but they don't know it's **bad**. 

Some of you doorknob-sucking retards will say that even though the virus wasn't priced in before, **NOW IT'S REALLY PRICED IN**. How many more times can you kick that can down the road? When are you going to realize that the market is just thrashing around trying to make sense of this meth-fueled donkey show like everybody else in the world?

Hindsight has shown us the market didn't anticipate the spread of coronavirus in the US, so why are you so confident that the market has somehow accounted for a future that is far less predictable?

We are at 1m subs now. At least 500k of which are pants on head retarded, 400k are normie/investor parrot types, leaving us with only around 90k true autists and 10k savants. The ratio of autist to normie is dwindling and not priced in. And yeah I know I should probably have made a pie chart of this for those unable to read.

The problem:
Every single day it‚Äôs just hundreds of posts of people circle jerking over common predictions and spy puts. Not only is this boring as hell it has caused the confidence in my positions to drop exponentially.

When someone makes a truly autistic play WHY do they get downvoted now??is that not the main entertainment of this sub? instead of the praise these posts deserve, they are filled with retards just repeating shit like ‚Äòiv crush bro..go further out‚Äô ‚Äòthis is why I‚Äôm cash gang.

Like, ‚ÄúI have x opinion, but no evidence; I‚Äôm just gonna YOLO anyway.‚Äù Like who does that except a gambler in Vegas?!? You would probably have more fun in Vegas.

Serious question? Do any of you use the 1 hour chart and buy if the 13 (SMA) crosses the 30 (SMA) going up and sell if the 13 (SMA) crosses the 30 (SMA) going down?

Sometimes after they cross price may go up or down a little but that allows you to buy/sell cheaper but price almost always continues in the direction of SMA cross once they cross. Don‚Äôt allow it to fake you out. Only cut ties if the fake out breaks the previous high before the SMA crossover. 

So why not use this one technical? It seriously is that simple. Buy near term calls/puts whenever these SMAs cross, like a week or two out. This SMA cross doesn‚Äôt happen that often.

This is a pretty common thing that works, this is what all of the pros on Wall Street do.

If I sell a stock/option from one account on one brokerage and then buy it with another account, am I breaking any particular rules by doing so?

I want to be able to move money from a regular trading account into a Roth IRA with another brokerage. I am not eligible to contribute due to income limits, but if I can find a way to sell a stock/option from within the IRA and then buy it from another account, I could theoretically move money into the IRA without making a transfer or contribution. This would then allow me to claim a loss on my main account, as well as move money into the IRA where it could appreciate tax-free.

fqy52o,johpick,Can I call on DAX:Dow Jones ratio?,"Yes I don't know what products are on the market. What I do know is

a) the DJ was overpriced way more than DAX. From Jan 2016 to Feb 2020, DJ made +75%. DAX only made 36%. Since the crisis started, they went pretty parallel.

b) Coronavirus is gonna hit the US economy way harder than any other country in the western world. No social security. Corrupt healthcare system. Housing crisis upcoming. Trump may be willing to sacrifice a quarter of elderly people thinking they are a burden; totally ignoring that people are not willing to do that and also ignoring the collaps that comes with it. Think of all the consumers vanishing.

c) When shit is over, German economy will return at maximum capacity.

I made dripping tendies on corona but now volatility is so high it would be jackshit to go on after next week. I'm looking for the next product to make real tendies on. I need a product that is at low volatility and will fucking explode when terrible tuesday hits.

Is there a financial product that I can buy or better call that represents inflation-adjusted ratio of DAX and Dow Jones?

Is there a financial product that I can buy or better call that compares German economic growth/decline to US economic decline?

Truth is, in this volatile market, the kinds of gains people are posting are definitely possible. Unlikely, but given how many autistic fucks throw their entire measly accounts into FDs, some of them are going to be timed perfectly. It‚Äôs just math. 

And if the posts are real, who gives a shit anyway? You want to gamble away all your money on the tiny chance that you‚Äôll follow in someone else‚Äôs footsteps then you to right ahead. I‚Äôm making my plays and I don‚Äôt need approval from a bunch of internet strangers.

There is a huge population of elderly in Florida and most are unprotected and just using their hands when they sneeze in public. Traffic wasn‚Äôt even affected. Truck drivers are pretty common over here and most are just getting by with some gloves. I can‚Äôt speak for the whole state because I only drove for about 10 miles, but most people don‚Äôt really give a fuck and the government isn‚Äôt really doing much except telling people to stay inside, but no one cares. I also think it‚Äôs fair to say that with the ‚ÄúFlorida man‚Äù memes coming from the news, our state is pretty much fucked.",208,1585443616,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqwozt/florida_dd_no_one_cares_about_beer_virus/,wallstreetbets,15

Hear me out

When I think typically about making tendies, I tend to think about making it so I can spend money on stuff ‚Äì a new car for my girlfriend's boyfriend, lube for me to use while JPow go Brrrrr, the latest sound-canceling headphones so I can read Reddit while my girlfriend has sex.

Buying things is pointless so I can keep upgrading things in my life. For example: That ‚Äúnew‚Äù DILDO? At some point, you get used to the larger size, the high-quality vibration, the excellent texture quality, and it‚Äôs just a Dildo now, even though is the top quality of its line

&amp;#x200B;

**When I use money to buy tendies, I adapt.**

Psychologists call this the ‚ÄúCuck-Autistic Order Chronic  Kawasaki syndrome ‚Äù (COCKS for short) ‚Äì I get used to being fucked in life, and the fucking becomes ‚Äúold things‚Äù and I decide that I need even newer things to fuck me.

Another reason that buying puts while JPow is running Unlimited QE was a reasonable decision on my mind. The puts won‚Äôt make me happy, but I did because I tend to compare myself to my girlfriend. I want to get fucked as her boyfriend  fucks her while I write this post

However, as retards with complex brains, I also adapt to new things in our environment remarkably well over time, like having an account decorated with Red.

I am in my safe place, Red is where I belong

fqw7lr,Jburd6523,A Bull &amp; Bear Argument by a Medical Professional Options Trader.,"My background: I'm Respiratory Care Practitioner that is certified as an Adult Critical Care Specialist. Although for the past year I have not been practicing in medicine and I make my living trading options. 

**Bull Argument**

It's already priced in. All of it. 

You know what causes dramatic sell offs? *UNEXPECTED* bad news. And in our current situation we're facing a fuckton of bad news that we already know is coming. Here's what we already know.

* Infection rates &amp; death rates will continue to skyrocket
* Unemployment numbers will continue to go up
* Earnings and guidance will be god awful
* Possible lowest PMI ever. 

If a retard like yourself already knows all of the above information, what makes you think the markets haven't already priced it in? This is why we all got fucked by a green dildo last Thursday. As the bad news we're already expecting becomes quantified, we will finally have certainty about the future and stonks will go up, or sideways. But probably not down, this isn't to say we won't briefly revisit the lows but I'm no longer a strong believer in Great Depression 2.0. Not to mention JPow has unlimited money. (By the way, do you think JPow fucks his wife as hard as he likes fuck WSB?)

TL/DR - Your April &amp; May puts r fuk

**Bear Argument**

Just recently I've started noticing reports of teenagers dying from Covid 19

And the first infant death was recently reported

On medical groups I browse on social media I've seen a few posts about young adults with no previous existing medical conditions having to be put on life support in hospitals around the country.

There also seems to be groups of people who became severely ill who initially tested negative repeatedly for the Corona virus before finally testing positive.  

Corona virus has been around for months and had no reported youth/infant deaths until now, and people who had no preexisting conditions we're not being severely affected. So why is it happening now? I hope with my entire being that I am incorrect in my assumption, but this could be the emergence of a mutated deadlier strain that is more difficult to detect working its way into our community. If this is true the world would have go into a global quarantine that would extend well beyond May or June. $SPY mooning or drilling will be the least of your worries because it'll be your parents, siblings, and classmates dying instead of old boomers. There would be nothing JPow or Trump would be able to do, that would offset that economic and societal devastation that this would bring to the world. 

TLDR - Please for the sake of your love ones, social distance and stay inside.

1. Coronavirus peaks in early summer with responsible measures taken like lockdowns. It is fairly well contained. Numbers are low when September comes.

2. People go back to work late April, infections explode, hospital beds are no where to be found. US suffers the most as a country, internationally.

3. Virus creates a crisis, people turn violent towards others/government. Lots of deaths (plus virus going around). 


Extra questions:

4. Would other countries follow US' tracks on monetary/fiscal policies? If so, would the USD come strong, ahead of the other currencies?

5. If coronavirus hits US harder than other countries, is it bullish for USD?

6. If global stock market goes lower than the previous low, is it bullish for the dollar? 

7. In what environment would the USD gain in value?


Please don't feel the need to answer all those questions. Just pick some.

I'm not sure this is a direct consequence of FED action, but there is some evidence in the stock market of price manipulation.

Notice the volume here, in this intraday chart?  
Since at least March 23, there is very low buying volume and greater selling volume, with moving averages pointing down. However, how the market rallied anyway?

This is only possible if someone is trying to manipulate the market. Since the market is so big, not even a single institutional investor can do it on its own. This suggests there's a bigger player messing with prices.

fquxcw,g3tafix,Trading Options on Interactive Brokers,"I know everyone here is a big fan of RobinHood. I've been using Interactive Brokers for quite a while to trade futures but only just started getting interested in learning how to trade options (thanks to WSB!) I was just messing around with the platform today and thought I'd show a snapshot of what Options trading looks like on the IB platform just in case anyone's interested.

The profile tool is quite handy as it shows you potential profit/loss at various percentage moves. In the example I chose buying a SPY JUN 19 PUT. There are a lot of additional tools for building advanced strategies etc but are a little too advanced for my current knowledge. I found this profile tool useful  for a newbie like me as I can easily see potential returns with various options. Now I've just gotta get acquainted with the greeks!

Having worked with these machines, they are fast, easy to use and really good.

If we can actually start testing in great numbers this could change the game.  Great news to ride into Monday.

edit: 

The  way South Korea went after the beer virus was aggressive testing then  aggressive quarantine for those who were positive and they family they  lived with. This could help flatten the curve way better then what we  are doing as my boomer neighbor have a social distancing party. Weeks  away from getting the test to all major cities but an actual weapon  against it and hopefully something NYC and San Fran can use next week to  help identify.

Yes,  the title and some BS to give attention to this post but really just  click bait  to share good news as we gamble on the fall of the world  economy.

fqsdzj,Send_Lawyers,The turning point from bear to bull in America.,"Hello,

3 weeks ago I proposed the inverse ghost buster bet that was SPY 105 5/15. That at its peak so far was a 10 bagger. Go me. 

Now after a doink on the bottom and rocket ride up this week people may be asking themselves how do I chose weather to be a gay bear or ghey bull. I think I‚Äôve found the answer. Do both. 

Currently week to week the spread is almost 10% on spy. So bracketing calls and puts around the mean on Monday and selling anything in the money or up üíØ 200% or higher is free cash. I did this all week. It wasn‚Äôt a 10 bagger but it was still free tendies. I imagine this will continue to work for a few more weeks. I‚Äôm 60/40 puts to calls. But I‚Äôm not holding 80% of it past 200% profit. Taking 5 2bags feels just as good as 1 10 bag. 

Next 
When does the market say ok enough of this shit and moon? Or have the volatility go back to not retard? And we go from hedges back to the real play of riding the recovery. I have a guess for that too.  I think it‚Äôs when anyone that wants a covid-19 test in America can get one. + two weeks. Right now you want that test. You fucked. You not at the hospital with your lungs hanging out your mouth no test. Not a famous athlete no test. Hell even if you‚Äôre in the icu maybe no test if you‚Äôre someplace heavily populated. 

So maybe Memorial Day 

TLDR Spy 100 5/15. 
Spy + 30% of the Whatever spy is on 5/15. With a strike date of 6/17. 

I am a professional retard who didn‚Äôt know what an option was in January and made 30k from $400 in 3 weeks. Curious to see where I‚Äôm at in another 3 weeks.",58,1585429023,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqsdzj/the_turning_point_from_bear_to_bull_in_america/,wallstreetbets,14

Don't let that SPY rally fool you. The plumbing of the economy (credit) is still clogged (transmission issues). It's like the septic tank is full of new shit BRRRRRRR'd by the fed, but the pipes are still 2"" because no bank is willing to lend while credit risk is elevated. You can see it with massive credit spreads like these:

 https://imgur.com/heGw8CI 

 https://imgur.com/j43WmhQ 

(You also hear stories of non-qualified/non-agency mortgages having problems, including Angel Oak laying off 70% of their staff)

Additionally because corporate paper is way too expensive to issue, these companies (\~100% which have a revolver) are drawing down on the revolvers. This creates additional shocks to the finance industry. Companies are doing this because

1. The CP markets are still locked up, and even blue chips have no access to short-term funding
2. Increasingly more companies are concerned their banks may not survive so why not just draw down the facility and hold the cash instead of being subject to the whims of some fickle bank Treasurer who may not have a job tomorrow
3. Banks can cancel revolvers at any time if they feel the risk is too high

You think this hasn't started? The FRA-OIS spread is a measure of interbank borrowing prices. Even though the [discount window is at 0.25%](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/), banks still refuse to lend to each other because of each other's credit risk (and the credit risk of each bank's borrowers). 

 https://imgur.com/S7WQtM2 

\------

So what can the Fed do right now? 

1. The more shit method: pump the septic tank with even more cash and hope the problem unclogs itself
2. The Drano method: force the banks to lend more (JPOW giving Dimon a handy and persuading him to lend to these troubled companies)
3. The extra pipe method: Fed directly lends to these businesses, as we've seen with the CP purchase program. Although ambitious, that still hasn't brought spreads down
4. The guarantee method: essentially the fed monetizing everyone's debt, including CCL's recent $7 billion issuance. They can promise buyers the bonds won't lose money, because they will buy the debt at the original price (similar to the TALF program)

In any case, the Fed will be pushed to move earlier than later. The Fed has opened Pandora's box of BRRRRRR in unlimited amounts and as soon as possible. They will be forced to move again to prevent large credit crunches sooner than later.

fqrw6a,Sportsguy02431,It hasn't been priced in,"So we've all heard about how there have been issues with getting testing done, the long waits, people waiting for a tests and never receiving them. This leads to a chronic under reporting of cases - because there are literally not enough tests to go around.

But we all know, and epidemiologists know, that there have been unreported cases going on underneath the surface, but there has been no way to track the true magnitude of this unreported population, due to testing issues. And since there is no sense of the magnitude of this unreported population, the market has been pseudo pricing in what could be a middle case scenario.

BUT - given reporting that we've been reading, I think that the current sense regarding the size of this unreported population is underestimating mildly at least, but I honestly think underestimating catastrophically at its worse. The core issue is that there has been no way to test this population... yet.

I think that given the soon wide availability of testing - see the link - we will soon see the number of cases explode beyond even the worst level of projections.  And then the market will tank further - If you're looking for the real goods - go far OTM. I think 5/1 150p is a honestly reasonable place where this market could land in the worst case scenario.

**TL;DR**: Buy moar puts because the market hasn't priced in the worse (and likely true) number of infected in the US.

**EDIT:** Also something else I've been thinking of is why wouldn't we have seen more cases out of China if this were the case - testing became widely available at the end and they were doing pretty rigorous contact tracing. While I think that they were doing a good job of tracking, there was still chronic under reporting upwards - while on the direct report numbers I have nothing more than speculation, the below article at the VERY least indicates that the death toll was widely under reported, with thousands more crematory urns being dispensed to Covid victims families than the number dead reported. I think that due to the wider press freedoms we have in the US, and more decentralized government, it won't be possible to keep this number of infected and dead nearly as quiet as they did in China.

fqrlak,randomcluster,Repeating volume patterns on SPY on open and close,"I noticed an interesting pattern over the last week of volume/price data for SPY. I know that volume in general is going to be higher at open/close compared to mid-day, but I didn't realize it was almost 100% higher than the intraday volume average (excluding the open and close volume spikes).

Is this due to stat arb and HFT funds closing out and opening positions right at open? What I don't understand is, wouldn't it make more sense to see what's happening after open and close, and then send in some orders, rather than not knowing what's going to happen after market open (I'm assuming the higher volume is due to execution of orders already on the orderbook, but this could be wrong), and having uncertainty as to whether your orders will fill or not?

fqrayc,holdmahdick,Please donate all of your tendies: A plea from a concerned citizen,"Dear /r/wallstreetbets,

The year is 2035. The üåàüêª gang came to power by loading up on puts before the market went tits up in the Great Fuckening of 2020. As the only people with capital remaining when the Fed ran out of money printer ink, they came to control the corporations, resources, and collective tendies of the world.  This represented the greatest wealth redistribution in history. The world became ruled by the impulsive dipshits who were the most leveraged during The Fuckening. Now billions starve while these autists gamble away their subjects' crucial resources.

I beg of you, when you make trillions of dollars in the Great Fuckening, please donate them all to your local food bank so that the world can be run by food bank administrators instead of your retarded asses.

Thank you,

fqqzl3,thesaddestcuck,Autistic Option Plays/Lottos for May/June,"Ok guys, in anticipation of a further market decline, we need to get our collective brains together. I am looking for some autistic YOLO plays (cheapish puts only for my üåàüêª status)  for the next few months or so. Saw someone mention in the weekend thread that BA 5/15 $50p were going for 1.76 - which started this (ty sir)

And before you retards say ‚Äúaint no way it‚Äôs going to drop that low‚Äù - no shit. I‚Äôm not in it to hold until the contract expires. Just looking to sell for a higher premium. 

I‚Äôve been looking at 5/15 and 6/19 LULU $100p (who is going to buy high priced clothes, esp with their stores closed down, when everyone is losing their jobs and cant afford shit). Also, im thinking their shit might be hard to size on, so ppl would be more inclined to try their clothes on first, thus limiting online purchases. Contracts are only ~2.00 at this time. 

Any and all replies/thoughts are appreciated.

Or maybe i just made this bc im so bored on the weekend and need something to do.

fqq0k2,ambermage,Bury me with my Stonks.,"MATW is going to moon soon.  
Price target \~$50 9/18  
Currently \~$22 / share

They make burial urns for the deceased. As we are all expecting a very high death toll it is very important to recognize that their stock is severely under priced currently. I have worked in the funeral business in the past and I can assure you profit margins are high.   
Anyone here who has lost a loved one knows what it's like to be price gouged during such an emotional time. That practice will continue and more importantly, the capability to hold full services will be greatly reduced.  
Why are cemeteries surrounded by fences? Because everyone is dying to get in.   


Now the part of solid DD.  
A cheap basic urn will cost you \~$150 not including the additional mark-ups $2k - $4k total per death.  
Their cost to produce is \~$15.  


Cremation is the service package most suggested for poor families.  
With the massive unemployment it's a gaurantee families can't summon Tens of thousands of dollars in 10 days to have a, ""proper funeral.""  
We will be burning poors in groups of thousands before the summer heats up.   
Families will be BBQing grandma and grandpa instead of sending $10k+ for a full funeral.  
Thus urn sales are going to moon.

fqp63i,blind_guy,Numbers (in NY but probably everywhere) are immensely higher than we know due to health dept advisories (document inside),"I work in healthcare in NYC.

On March 20 the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene sent out a COVID-19 in Advisory #8. Here are the first few lines:

* Outpatient testing must not be encouraged, promoted or advertised.
* Persons with COVID-like illness not requiring hospitalization should be instructed to stay home. It is safer for the patients and health care workers and testing does not currently change clinical management or recommendations about staying home.
* Hospital systems may create alternate testing venues to offload their emergency
departments.
* This minimizes risk of transmission to others, especially healthcare workers (HCWs)
* There is a national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), collection swabs,
and viral transport media supplies and it is critical that laboratory testing be prioritized
for hospitalized patients
* There is no reason to test asymptomatic persons or mild-to-moderately ill persons who
are not hospitalized, including HCW or first responders
* Testing may play a more significant role after the pandemic has peaked

Later in the document:

&gt; To preserve PPE for HCW providing medically necessary care for hospitalized patients, the NYC Health Department is directing healthcare facilities to IMMEDIATELY STOP TESTING NON-HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS FOR COVID-19 unless test results will impact the clinical management of the patient. In addition, do not test asymptomatic people, including HCWs or first responders. COVID-19 testing is only indicated for HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.

You can find the whole document here: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2020/covid-19-03202020.pdf

fqotgk,TheWorstTroll,The role of HFT in setting Market Open/Close and User Order Flow Data,"u/Variation-Separate has added a lot to the discussion about the way the market behaves due to the action of large firms and market makers. I'm not an economist but I have done some research and in general just a whole lot of pondering on this matter and I think I've come to a logical conclusion. 

What V-S has said is that his strategy lies in finding what he believes large firms use to be consistently successful. What I am going to suggest is that while he may be correct that the strategies reflect the actions of these firms, the firms are not passive actors in this. It is much more helpful to look at these firms, not as investors like you or I, but as bookies. 

**Market Makers are Bookies**

A bookie determines the odds of a given event by calculating the probability of every outcome, then subtracting their margin. What I am going to suggest shouldn't even be controversial, that MM's are essentially doing the exact same thing, and their margin is reflected in the Bid-Ask spread.  

**Order Flow**

Anyone who has done any research on trading platform's TOS knows that every trading platform for retail investors sells user order flow data to HFT firms. I'm not going to bother copy pasting sources here, a google search will turn this up for you immediately. This means that HFT know exactly where all the retail money is at any given time. From now on, I'm going to call this retail money, ""The cream""

**Financial Institutions and Derivatives**
Financial institutions hire market makers to trade their assets at the prices they want to see on them. From now on, I'm going to call this institutional money ""The milk"" The market maker needs these assets to literally make the market, these are massive sums of assets that form the backbone of everything. The market maker is beholden to these institutions because they make up the majority of their business. If the market maker spills the milk, heads are going to roll. 

**How Market Makers Ensure Success**

A good market maker will make returns for their clients and themselves no matter what the conditions are. How can this even be possible when it is so easy to lose money on a bet? The answer, is they steal the cream.

It is no coincidence that massive drops in the market are preceded by every idiot getting a trading account and trying to get a piece of the market. This is the best indicator that the market is fat. When the market is fat, there is plenty of cream to take. They need retail to buy their milk for the price of cream. So how do they take it? Simple, by causing euphoria and panic. 

Ever notice how most of the market movement occurs in AH trading, at times where the volume is the lowest? At low volume times it becomes easy to move the open up to 5% in either direction. This is a massive advantage for MM's. And yes, there are competing interests in this matter. Think of it like an auction.  What the real futures traders aren't bidding on isn't this or that stock or ETF, what they are bidding on is the price at open.

**Then comes the Volume**

The first 10 minutes of open are a massive percentage of the overall volume of the market relative to time. After setting the open (Literally ""Making the Market"") HFT firms call out their bets when the derivatives markets open. Various funds and retail buys in at their prices more or less the rest of the day. Occasionally, some big event will cause high volume movement mid day, but that is really pretty rare. The open price really sets the first datapoint of two that are the most important to our bookies, the second of which, is the close.

**The Closing Bell**

The last 10 minutes has become insane lately. Sometimes the last two candles of the day are more volume than the past couple of hours total. We saw this in a big way Friday. All the gains for the day were wiped out in 10 minutes. This was theft of the cream. Often, those last 10 minutes will push the market to Max Pain like clockwork also. Every day that doesn't end at max pain is spilled milk. 

Max Pain on 3/31 is nearly 285. Max Pain on 4/1 is 255. Use that information as you will. 


**What this all means to retail investors**

There's two kind of cream in this market now, your standard r/investing passive ETF people, and your highly leveraged /r/wallstreetbets people. In terms of hard cash, there is a lot more money in retail ETFs than there is in retail options (I haven't done any research on this but it is just common sense IMO, if anyone knows how to find this data I would love to see it). So the goal of any MM right now is to take as much cream as possible from this, and in order to do that they need to suck Passive people dry without losing their ass on options contracts. They have all the order flow plugged in already, their algos can just use that to figure out exactly where the market needs to be for this to happen. They will pass out the maximum amount of $ROPE possible. 


So what do I think is going to happen? There are a ton of people following V-S. There are probably a literal fuckton of people following his rough strikes, all the way out til June. If I am a MM right now, and I'm doing market research, I'm looking at all these people and wondering how I fuck them over. V-S has already said that a move above 270 could mean we make it to 300. I already said Max Pain on 3-31 is ~285. If you wanted to squeeze as many options contracts as possible, who you know are using this DD, and ROPE as many as possible on 3-31, what do you think you would make sure we close at on Tuesday?

Then surprise, Wednesday Max Pain is ~255! Holy fuck! Why is there such a difference there? Because these motherfuckers KNOW that you will sell your puts on Tuesday, and by Wednesday they can safely tip this cow and scare the fuck out of a shitload of passive investors. Now those fuckers can pull their 401k's TAX FREE for fucks' sake. They will have stolen all your money by then anyway, so the retail options market will be a whole lot weaker, then we can proceed as planned with the next leg down.

fqol7h,RainMKR,From Liquidity to Solvency Crisis: Why WSB is getting screwed even when it‚Äôs right,"Hey. Let me tell you about how WSB is getting screwed even when it‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs a novel so go make some tea.

The past week has been crazy. 3m unemployed and stocks only went up. Makes no sense, right? Wrong. What you guys need to realize is that the market is not an omnipotent being that prices in every move and plays 4d chess. It‚Äôs more like a caveman, driven by greed and fear. Especially during this time.

Three weeks ago, everything was fucked. Not because the virus was spreading, which it always was, but because people started to realize how bad it was and began panic selling. And the trigger was the oil crisis over the weekend that led to bloody Monday. Leveraged funds exploded. Investors were getting margin called or panic sold. Treasuries were basically unobtainable. Corporate bond issuances completely froze. Credit default swaps skyrocketed. Commercial REITS were fucked because they needed to sell illiquid assets to meet fund outflows. Every company was maxing out its credit lines with the banks‚Ä¶you get the idea.

It was like a run on the banks, but for corporations and investors. That‚Äôs what drove the markets down. Plain and simple. It was FEAR of a LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

Then Powell stepped in with his alphabet soup of liquidity mechanisms. ZIRP, PDCF, MMLF, CPFF, FX Swap, TALF, PTIF, ESF, SMCCF, PMCCF. I made up one in there and it doesn‚Äôt even matter.

What mattered was that, suddenly, the liquidity crisis vanished. The fund backstopped everything with its QE infinity. Yield spreads fell back. People didn‚Äôt need to margin sell anymore. Foreign dollar denominated debt wasn‚Äôt about to fuck up an emerging world country economy. THAT‚Äôs what rallied the market. Immediate FEAR was taken out. And that‚Äôs why all the ‚Äúbut worldometer virus count doubles every three days so markets go down‚Äù geniuses got screwed.

For better or worse, with the Fed promising QE forever, the liquidity crisis is now no longer a thing. What comes next will be more ominous: a solvency crisis.

Liquidity is basically any company‚Äôs ability to pay very short-term liabilities, like payroll, interest, rent, etc. in the VERY IMMEDIATE TERM. It's about access to cash. For financial markets, it‚Äôs also how easily investors can get in and out of positions. Powell lubed the shit out of liquidity.

Solvency, on the other hand, is about the company‚Äôs ability to meet LONG TERM debt obligations with its operations. When you talk about unemployment, no consumer spending, high corporate debt load,etc, what you‚Äôre really talking about is a solvency issue. Companies can‚Äôt produce the revenue to service their debts.

Corporate debt levels are astronomical today. Higher than any level in history. At same time, the virus is not slowing. Consumers and companies are not going to spend. Unemployment is through the roof. The fundamentals are really, really bad.

BUT here‚Äôs the kicker, now we‚Äôre talking about fundamentals, and NOT fear. The market will trade down because the fundamentals are bad, not because its panicking for lack of liquidity, and that will take time.

What I‚Äôm saying is yes, the outlook is atrocious and the market deserve to be much lower. BUT it will take much longer to play out because people are no longer panic selling. The Great Depression took 3 years to get from its high to bottom after Bloody Thursday/Tuesday.

Yes, maybe the SPY will hit 180 or even lower. BUT it may take 6 months to get there. Meanwhile your OTM 4/17 puts will bleed on theta and never get ITM.

We‚Äôre still at a time of VIX backwardation, meaning expected volatility in the more distant future is LESS than in the near future. I think this is bullshit and an opportunity. With a solvency crisis, it‚Äôs a slow burn all the way down.

Or I‚Äôm just full of shit.

TL;DR: look for long-dated puts. July, September, or even later. Buckle up and pay the premium. Be careful with very short term, very OTM options. Volatility will likely go down even as stocks go down.",568,1585416958,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqol7h/from_liquidity_to_solvency_crisis_why_wsb_is/,wallstreetbets,39

fqnrhf,gzameth1,Economy vs stock prices,"Listen we have all had our fun riding puts off the corona pandemic, heres some reasoning that it might be short lived.

So the sudden drop in stock prices we just experienced is unlike any other in history to my knowledge.  The selloff wasnt based on any underlying fundamental flaw in our economy.  

In 08 the housing market was built on a deck of cards.  

In 29 the banks didnt have cash on hand to back their deposits.  

In 2020 the stock market crashed over uncertainty involving the supply chain disruption coming from virus stricken china, it dropped more over uncertainty of productivity in the US during our own lockdowns, it dropped more cuz FUCKING OIL.  Now its kinda sideways.  Theres not much more uncertainty left for it to drop much more.  

Sure we will hit a breaker on monday, but thats a correction to the past week maybe.  

But the stock market is not the economy.  The stock market is generally a month or two ahead of the economy.  If investors see things happening next month they react now.  Investors are watching the global numbers and see that certain countries are NOT burning down.  They are looking at May 2020 and seeing businesses starting operations again and a tapering off of the COVID numbers.  What could possibly happen before May that would cause more uncertainty than the EVERYTHING SHUTTING DOWN that we are currently doing?? I really cant see anything, thats why the timing of the oil plummet was so devastating.  

Sorry for the wall of text.  

TLDR:  dont YOLO anything, maybe SPY 280c 6/19/2020 with a 4/17 220p to hedge.

The fed brrrrr printing machine is rubber stamping loans through PMCCF and SMCCF.

&gt;U.S. industrial conglomerate, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, released a disappointing sales forecast in January before the Covid-19 virus hit as an industrial slowdown crimped revenue growth.   
&gt;  
&gt;Honeywell‚Äôs aerospace unit sales had already been hurt by the production halt of Boeing Co.‚Äôs grounded 737 Max.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúAs the coronavirus halts global growth, Honeywell faces pressure in aerospace after-market sales, which represent 41% of its largest and most profitable segment,‚Äù Ubelhart said.

Considering a majority of US-based airlines have already cut their international flights, grounding their planes, and probably canceling their future airplane orders considering the decreased demand, I think there is potential long-term trouble for Honeywell.

Other factors to think about:

&lt;Potential downsides&gt;

* Decreased demand from the energy sector due to falling oil/natural gas prices
* Decreased consumer product demands (HVAC, air purifiers, etc.)
* Decreased number of construction

&lt;Potential upsides&gt;

* Currently in discussion with a major bank for additional loans
* High bond ratings
* Decent amount of cash ($50 billion)
* Quantum computing (lul)

Options volume very low, bid/ask difference high. Perhaps something like 4/17 or 4/24 125p? Will be a significant gamble since their earnings report will come in right around that time.",27,1585409798,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqme64/honeywell_hon_buy_puts/,wallstreetbets,1

fqlu1t,Thebrofessor_x,Bad news kills bear markets,"You dont understand why the markets go up when 3,283,000 Americans were in the queue of newly registered unemployed on Thursday.? 

The paths of global stock markets may seem irrational, which became evident in the past week when both price declines and negative sentiment in a split second turned to notable increases.

The unemployment figure not only exceeds everything we've ever seen, but it also puts so much distance from the previous record of 695,000 in 1982 that you can hardly grasp it.

There are, of course, good reasons for the remarkable fluctuation. Because with the corona virus we all know all too well that shutting down societies and calling for social distance puts everything on pause. You don't have to be an economics professor to understand that it can have huge consequences, cause massive unemployment and put global economics under serious pressure. Even the fucking autists on here, and their wifes boyfriend know to buy puts.

**In other words, Thursday's US unemployment rate was decidedly bad news. But how on earth did bad news turn into good news in the global stock markets?**

**They did this by creating clarity.**

Security beats poor key figures. Investors are concerned about companies' future earnings and opportunities. Therefore, they are often something similar to six months ahead when assessing whether an investment is interesting or not.

Six months of great uncertainty due to the corona virus is a lot, and any element that can eliminate uncertainty is met with a kissing hand. Likewise, huge state aid packages and central banks want to do whatever it takes, of course.

When the sellers in the market have got everything that is lousy prospects on the table and do not have more scare and doomsday scenarios, they also get ready to flip the cart and buy up

When the unemployment figure was published on Thursday, it was probably a tummy tuck to many, but a tummy tuck you can feel, so to speak. There are facts on the table and real information that you can relate to. It is uncertainty that is converted to security. And it is fear of even worse data being put to shame.

**No doubt the uncertainty remains high in the global financial markets, but with the initial sensations of how bad the current crisis is (and will be), investors can incorporate it into the current stock prices.And that is exactly why bad news often kills a bear market. When investors get real data, they can take into account the ills and difficult times ahead, eliminate the uncertainty and recognize the facts.**

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think, unfortunately, the coming weeks and maybe even months will offer much more uncertainty and great volatility - but my guess is as good as yours.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Bad news are good because it reduces uncertainty**

fqlt2w,Captndawg,Parallels Between This Weeks Corrective Price Action And The Crash Of 1973 Using Crayon Art,"IMO the SPY drop to 150-180 projections being thrown around are a little too aggressive for me to commit positions to so I really wanted to do some analysis that would fit my narrative. After listening to u/Variation-Separate and others on the Twitch stream yesterday, I was inspired to break out my crayon box and see if I could summon the powers of Ms Cleo by drawing some straight lines on a chart.  

As a basis for my artwork I thumbed through my dusty old copy of ‚ÄòElliott Wave Principal‚Äô by Frost and Prechter (2005 version) to see if there was any insights on pull backs (ups?) during a bear run. I came across this graph of a correction during the crash of ‚Äô73 and thought it looked vaguely familiar to the correction occurring now. 

![img](s6bpdhuwefp41)

I decided to cross reference the percent moves against what‚Äôs happening now to see if I could draw any parallels and I was actually a bit surprised at the results. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](es865891ffp41)

This matrix compares the corrective movement in the DJIA to the corrective movement occurring now in SPY. While 1973 didn‚Äôt have as deep of an initial drop, I‚Äôm only interested in the corrective movement ratios which so far has been aligning pretty fuckin close (yellow text is projected as it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet). 

If we are expecting similar price action to the 1973 corrective movement, I‚Äôd say we are in the zone right before the peak labeled ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the 1973 chart with sideways movement before a pop and drop. I‚Äôd say another test of 264 is possible on Monday or Tuesday, otherwise this bitch takes a dump over some days/weeks to 202. 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](nero7dy8ffp41)

  

Now don‚Äôt take this as gospel, I‚Äôm just some idiot with access to a box of crayons and knowledge of the percent change formula. Its just another thing you might consider when refining your positions for the next leg down that so many have predicted.

If you are unfamiliar with Elliott Wave theory, in a nutshell, it‚Äôs a principal developed by a partnership between Nostradamus, Ms Cleo, and some dude named Elliot in the 1930s that says the stock market moves in repeatable and identifiable patterns that align with Fibonacci ratios and some hocus pocus counting shit. People have been using it in TA ever since, but problem is 5 different people could come up with 5 different counts as its easy to get lost in the noise. This seems like a bit more obvious of a setup tho, but then again I‚Äôm just an idiot with a crayon.   Yeah were not in 1973, yeah the market dynamics and time frame are different, but Elliott wave is about the ratios and movements being repeatable and identifiable, not fundamentals so dont @ me with that shit.

fqlsst,arpatel530,Free Money Idea,"I was talking to some other degenerates the other day. They were too busy trying to turn $50k into $5 in a matter of days. I told them I have a win win situation backed by your boi J Pow.

Take out a SBA loan for $1m. Just create a fake hedge fund and show some expenses. I think this sub would be able to do that given all the fake screenshot YOLOs that are posted. 

Next put that $1m into some boring as fuck company like WFC, etc. Something that will pay 7%+ in dividends so like 70k a year.  

Now here is the beauty of the situation. The SBA loan is interest free for the first year aka first one is free for options yolo. After that it is a paltry 3.75% per year. 

You could either pay the loan back after first year and collect a free 7% dividend. Alternatingly you could just hold the stock and collect the difference every year. 

Granted WFC could go lower but who gives a fuck. Just reinvest those dividends at a cheaper price until it gets back to a profit. 

The kicker. Your boi J Pow would never let the banks collapse.

I call this the free money to making free money approach. Aka trickle down economics.

# **What could be ‚Äòshocker‚Äô economic reports may test stocks in week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/what-could-be-shocker-economic-reports-may-test-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
&gt; As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,‚Äù said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ‚Äù$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # Sharp recession
&gt; In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
&gt; Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we‚Äôre going to get a clearer picture,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he‚Äôs watching the PMI data. ‚ÄúThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it‚Äôs sell first, ask questions later.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI expect that we‚Äôll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to see that in the next few weeks at least,‚Äù said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
&gt; # More Fed Artillery
&gt; Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
&gt; The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar‚Äôs run on Friday.
*****
&gt; As the world‚Äôs reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there‚Äôs some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we‚Äôre not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,‚Äù said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching what‚Äôs going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.‚Äù
*****
&gt; # ‚ÄòLiquidity infinity‚Äô
&gt; Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
&gt; John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed‚Äôs actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. ‚ÄúThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can‚Äôt take it anymore,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I‚Äôm calling it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What‚Äôs the good news over the weekend? That they‚Äôre going to pass this bill? That‚Äôs already in the price.‚Äù

# Will the Fed‚Äôs Bold Moves Keep Yields from Rising?

&gt; With the major stock market indexes all entering a bear market this month, it‚Äôs no surprise that stocks have stolen most of the spotlight. However, actions taken by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to support what may be considered the safest part of the bond market, US Treasuries, may actually have more lasting implications for investors‚Äô portfolios.

&gt; From February 19 through midday March 9, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell an incredible 125 basis points (1.25%), briefly reaching an all-time low of just 0.31%. In fact, the 14-day relative strength index RSI on the 10-year yield, a technical measure of momentum, was more oversold than at any point since 1971. Since then yields came roaring back, trading as high as 1.27%, before fading back to near 0.8% currently.

&gt; It is logical to think that the incredibly bold moves from the Fed, including unlimited Treasuries purchases, will help keep yields down. But could yields actually rise from here after the Fed writes the bond market a blank check? History says yes, which seems counter-intuitive. For investors, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the combination of low starting yields and rising interest rates may lead to meager future fixed income returns.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, following prior announcements of quantitative easing (Fed securities purchases), yields have actually risen. Part of that story is the market pricing in higher inflation expectations as a result of the ‚Äúmoney printing.‚Äù Another piece is the market becoming more confident in economic recovery. ‚ÄúThe massive injection of liquidity into the bond market by the Federal Reserve‚Äîin concert with fiscal stimulus‚Äîsurely helps shore up the economy and credit marekts for an eventual recovery,‚Äù noted LPL Financial Sr. Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; LPL Research forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield will end 2020 in the range of 1.25-1.75%. Outcomes outside of that range are certainly possible depending on how long it takes to get the pandemic under control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Yields-after-QE.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; If the roughly $2 trillion in fiscal stimulus is added to the Fed‚Äôs securities purchases, and additional lending capacity that the Fed‚Äôs new programs create, the economy will get a $5-6 trillion jolt in the next several months to help us get through this crisis to the other side. In a $22 trillion US economy, that is significant and far exceeds the stimulus that dug the economy out of a ditch after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This human crisis is not over unfortunately, but the bold moves from policymakers should help lessen the blow. The size of hit became evident in Thursday‚Äôs massive spike in jobless claims. The economic data will get worse before it gets better, but visibility into the peak of this crisis is starting to come into view and markets‚Äîboth stocks and bonds‚Äîmay be beginning to sniff that out.

*****

# Making Sense of Skyrocketing Jobless Claims

&gt; Weekly new jobless claims were reported this morning, and to no one‚Äôs surprise they rose to levels thought unimaginable just a few weeks ago. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 3.3 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in the week ending March 21, almost 5 times the previous high of 695,000 set in 1982.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe personal and economic disruptions represented by the latest new claims number are staggering,‚Äù said LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. ‚ÄúThis is a genuine human crisis, and a robust response from the Federal Reserve and Congress seems appropriate. Unfortunately, we do expect more numbers like this in the coming months. At the same time, markets are forward looking and will be more focused on how quickly we might be able to get to the other side.‚Äù Per LPL‚Äôs Chart of the Day:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-Chart-20-03-26-New-Claims.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While the number of new claims is extraordinary, it‚Äôs not entirely unexpected. The United States and countries across the globe have shut down entire segments of their economies in an effort to delay or disrupt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the jobs most impacted by social-distancing measures, such as cashiers, restaurant workers, and hotel staff, are in the services sector, which now makes up about 80% of the jobs in the United States.

&gt; There is no silver lining in a number like this, but there is reason for hope. The US economy was not in a recession prior to the global spread of COVID-19. Workers are not being let go because of some structural fault in the economy or a financial crisis. As a result, when the slowdown ends, we may not see the extended hiring delay that has typically followed recessions. In fact, a surge in demand may require extra hiring, although it may not take place until people are fully confident that social distancing is no longer necessary.

&gt; Markets may not be responding to the dramatic numbers seen this morning, but they have been absorbing the rapidly changing economic expectations it represents over the last few weeks. We‚Äôll see a lot of this over the next couple of months: historic numbers with markets seemingly unmoved. But it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre indifferent. Economic data is slow moving and backward looking, while our economic reality has been changing at an unprecedented pace. Even new unemployment claims, which are released weekly, seem somewhat stale. Markets will still be reacting to shifting expectations of the depth and duration of the slowdown, as well as the effectiveness of policies to help businesses and workers get to the other side.

# Market Volatility Stresses Liquidity

&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in recent weeks that has investors and traders scrambling to assess the economic and market impact of the aggressive containment measures.

&gt; This past week the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied 30-day volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index based on options contracts, measured its highest reading since its inception at over 82‚Äîbesting the prior high set during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, shown in the chart below. That is saying something.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Blog-volatility.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As market participants have sought shelter from the storm in traditional safe havens such as US Treasuries, gold, or cash, we have seen signs that liquidity has dried up. All that means is buyers have become more tentative, demanding lower prices to get trades done due to the historic volatility and heightened uncertainty. That in turn can lead to wider bid-ask spreads for market participants‚Äîboth retail investors and institutions‚Äîand we sometimes see a dollar of value selling for 95 cents, if not less.

&gt; We have seen some of this in the corporate bond markets in recent days. Even short-maturity, high-quality investment grade corporate bond strategies have seen market prices disconnect with their fair value, as measured by net asset value (NAV). That metric essentially adds up the value of individual bonds in a portfolio such as an exchange-traded fund, which should in theory match the market price of the security that we all see on our screens.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn volatile markets, quality items go on sale to clear the racks because there aren‚Äôt a lot of shoppers walking through the malls,‚Äù noted Ryan Detrick, LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist. ‚ÄúImproving liquidity in all markets can help restore investor confidence after being shaken the past few weeks.‚Äù

&gt; At their worst, these conditions can translate into serious dislocations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis when banks didn‚Äôt trust each other enough to make overnight loans and credit froze up. Short-term lending is a necessary lubricant for economic activity.

&gt; Investors can get hurt selling into these dislocated markets. This is where the Federal Reserve (Fed) comes in. The programs the Fed launched on Monday, March 23‚Äîincluding buying large amounts of corporate bonds‚Äîare aimed at restoring health to credit markets. The central bank‚Äôs aggressive bond purchases (as much as needed) should help restore orderly trading in corporate bonds and narrow spreads, a measure of risk, which have widened significantly in recent weeks. As shown in the chart below, spreads are still well short of 2008-2009 highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Credit-spreads-blog-chart-for-3-24-20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; There is some other good news here. These dislocations can present opportunities for buyers to get discounts they may not otherwise see in normally functioning market environments. We aren‚Äôt suggesting running out and buying securities trading at the biggest discounts to their intrinsic value. Instead, we are highlighting that attractive opportunities are emerging in the corporate bond market, particularly in strategies focused on strong companies that may emerge on the other side of this crisis as leaders of the economic rebound.

# Time In The Market Versus Timing The Market

&gt; The incredible volatility continues, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now in one of its worst bear markets ever, along the way making the quickest move from an all-time high to down 30% at only 22 days. What is a long-term investor to do?

&gt; ‚ÄúAlthough market timing is very alluring to investors, especially after the past few weeks, the reality is timing things incorrectly can set you back significantly,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúIn fact, if you started in 1990 and missed the best day of the year each year for the S&amp;P 500, your annual return was nearly cut in half.‚Äù

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the annualized return for the S&amp;P 500 from 1990 to 2019 was 7.7%. Yet, if all you missed was the best day of the year, that return dropped to only 3.9%. Miss the best two days of each year, and you were up less than 1% a year. Taking it to the extreme, if you missed the best 20 days of each year, you‚Äôd be down 27% per year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-3.24.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; No one can consistently pick the best or worst days of the year, so this is why it can be so dangerous for investors to miss time in the market by trying to time the market. If you miss one or two big days, compounded over time, this can greatly impact your portfolio.

*****

# Boeing (BA) Sends the Dow Flying

&gt; Turnaround Tuesday has carried into hump day with the Dow up well over 5% again today as of this writing. As we mentioned in an earlier post, that means the Dow is on track for its first back-to-back up days for the first time since early February. Remarkably, even with only two consecutive up days, the index is closing in on exiting a bear market. For that to happen, the Dow would need to close above the 22,310.32 level which is 20% off of the bear market closing low (Monday's close at 18,591.93). At today's high, the Dow was less than 300 points or 1.32% from that level.

&gt; As for the individual stocks contributing to the rally, Boeing (BA) deserves a lot of thanks. The stock has been hit very hard during the sell-off. Whereas the stock has traded in the mid-$300 for much of the past two years and up to mid-February, as of late last week BA had fallen below $100. That massive drop in price means that day to day movements in the stock would have a lesser impact on the level of the price-weighted Dow. In spite of this, BA has contributed over 400 points to the Dow's rally in the past two days alone! That is much more than any other stock in the index with the next biggest contributor being UnitedHealth (UNH) who's 335.44 point contribution comes as its share price is currently around $100 more than BA. BA's contribution is also almost 200 points more than those of McDonald's (MCD), Visa (V), and Apple (AAPL). Of all 30 Dow stocks, there is only one that is down over the past couple of days, subtracting from the index's rally: Walmart (WMT). Given WMT has held up fairly well recently, its performance is yet another example of investors' focus on the more beaten down names that we have noted earlier today and in last night's Closer.

Computers run off of complex MATH algorithms. 

These take the calculations of what‚Äôs going on from the outside and edits them to create performance indicators. 

Adding, ‚Äòinfinity‚Äô, to any algorithm will throw the whole thing off from anything reasonable and out the hands of the big guys directly into the heart of the system. 

The inflation of cash injected into these companies is also throwing the averages thru the roof. In a time where we should be sinking, the Mega Diamond Hands are shoved right into the heart of the machines to control the triggered sell-off‚Äôs and buy-in‚Äôs. 

There‚Äôs more at play here than a real market. When people say things like, ‚Äòpriced in‚Äô - it‚Äôs all priced in because the algorithms are looking into infinite.

fql6po,AloneForever,"Longer term bets on the decline of brick and mortar retail, commercial real estate","Hey autists,

I've been thinking about what types of longer term plays to make from this üç∫ü¶†. When I say long term, I mean businesses that will be drastically affected by the economic decline within 1 year's time, but may be currently weathering the storm.

Examples of companies that are getting wrecked right now are travel, entertainment, etc. Those businesses, however, will probably bounce back pretty quickly once things pick up again. Maybe not to 100% of their previous levels, but easily to 80% or 90%.

However, I think there's going to be a bunch of business that bleed slowly and won't show the affects of the recession for a while. Some examples of this are the real estate market, specifically commercial real estate (which is something other people have talked about), potentially banks and lenders. Cruises might be completely wrecked long term, but that's probably already priced in.

For commercial real estate, you could try shorting CMBS. I don't have a position on this yet, but I am considering buying puts 1 year out. CMBS is made up of mortgage backed securities from the commercial RE market. This is likely to take a huge pounding if lots of businesses shut down (plus I think there's an RE bubble).

Another option is traditional retail: the shutdown is going to cause a spike in online shopping, and anyone who's been holding out and NOT shopping online will discover that going into retail stores sucks massive donkey pp. I think the decline of traditional retail will accelerate very quickly after this event. I don't think it's priced in as there are still a lot of crappy retail chains which seem to be operating.

ProShares has 2 ETFs to bet on the decline of retail:

* CLIX: [https://www.proshares.com/funds/clix.html](https://www.proshares.com/funds/clix.html)
* EMTY: [https://www.proshares.com/funds/emty.html](https://www.proshares.com/funds/emty.html)

I prefer CLIX because it's a long/short position. You can benefit doubly from the boost in online shopping and the big decline in retail. I think the way to play this is to buy LEAP calls on the underlying indexes and hold for a few months.

Positions: I don't have any positions on either of these funds (yet), but I'll probably place my bets this week.

tl;dr: Buy slightly OTM calls on CLIX, 1 year out, be very patient. Buy slightly OTM puts on CMBS, 1 year out, be very patient.",17,1585405767,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fql6po/longer_term_bets_on_the_decline_of_brick_and/,wallstreetbets,1
fql5is,BudnamedSpud,"VIX, Recession Patterns, Donnie Pump, and You","So VIX, an ETF that tracks volatility within the S&amp;P500, has been declining lately and has made me question alot of things.

This epidemic literally JUST started in the US a little more than around a week ago, now seems like a really odd time for peoples fears with the market to decline. Right?

At the same time, the markets going up for seemingly no reason. THE ONLY GOOD NEWS IS THE SOFTENING OF THE BAD NEWS. The feds pumping money like no tomorrow and the administration seems to be making alot of promises they cannot keep such as

1. the 15 days to end the spread campaign
2. EVERYONE gets a bailout
3. coronavirus cure/treatment/vaccine
4. Back to work by the end of easter

If the pandemic in the US is going to mirror other countries, this has JUST GOTTEN STARTED. There are so many unknowns here. What will the infected rate do? Will companies be able to open back up soon? What will unemployment numbers look like? Will we have a national lockdown? Will trump deploy martial law? There is literally so many reasons I can think of for things to hit the fan and send people in a mass panic. Meanwhile, what good news is going to come about? The stimulus package has been passed and congress is on recess until April 20th. Every way the US could have acted they have. There's nothing more to do. Until an end to the pandemic is in sight, the US economy will only feel pain and many companies are planning on being closed until the end of April.

So it seems like

1. markets are rising on false hopes
2. things can only get worse

But nevermind my opinions, WSBers are wrong ALL the time. Let's look at some previous recessions VIX data then let's look at ours so far

Now: ([macrotrends.net](https://macrotrends.net/))

VIX 2020 high - 82

VIX 2008 high - 82

VIX 1987 high - 172

so far, we've just matched levels from 2008 meanwhile unemployment is estimated to hit over 20%, WAY WORSE than 2008 fear levels. At the same time, we haven't even come close to 1987 fear levels. Along with this, the markets only declines \~25% meanwhile 2008 declined by 54%. If this really is going to be comparable to the great depression, we can expect to drop ALOT more.

At the same time, look at the bounces in volatility in 2008 and 1987. Both see bounces starting 50-60 before again skyrocketing. 2008 much more so since it was more of a prolonged recession compared to 1987's flash crash.

I believe we have yet to see peak volatility and I believe the current VIX is about to bottom out, making now a VERY opportunistic time to purchase options. Buy calls and puts, I think we are about to see old highs and new lows very soon. Ride the IV to tendy city while you can.

Tldr; VXX 90c 5/1 SPY 180p 5/1

Back to work by the end of Easter dated for 2021, cant go tits up. Also look into ETFs like SPXL if you want to play incoming spy rallies but not risk IV crush with calls.

Wanted to make this call before VXX moons.

fqkvbo,ORCoast19,Why Monday will be RED,"1. Beer Flu should be up to ~150k infections and 3k deaths in the US by monday‚Äôs open. Dead people + fear = downward market pressure. 

2. The stimulus bill allows up to 100k withdraws on retirement accounts. Selling to cash out, boomers will tank the market. 

3. The stimulus bill doesn‚Äôt save businesses with high fixed costs such as chain resturants or car dealerships. Their high cost to carry will kill them. Bankrupcies will send some stocks to 0 and spook investors. 

4. Trump is trying to keep the market green, and when has he ever succeeded at his goals? (less the whole becoming president thing, and impeachment cock block)

5. The lending market is still screwed up, hence why mortgage rates are jumping up and down like the mexican peso. Turbulence in the market means lack of liquidity for businesses and individuals. I even tried to get a 100k loan for puts and they wouldn‚Äôt do it, the fuck. 

6. Oil continues to crater, and is under $1/gal in some parts of the US right now. The oil &amp; gas companies, and all businesses that cater to them, will follow suit if a reversal doesnt come fast.

7. Right now only half the people see Trump as incompetent. The other half see him as doing God‚Äôs work. As tom hanks virus kills off people more and more will see his incompetency, and if you can‚Äôt trust your president how can you trust the market?

8. Thats all I got at the moment but I‚Äôm sure you guys have more, comment what else will crash us!

Like the title says, this shit is biblical proportions and that means one thing... only god knows what's up. I poured over countless pages and there it was as plain as day.  Probably will get a visit from the SEC for this kind of inside info:

&gt;On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.¬†They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.¬†While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.¬†In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, ‚ÄúWhy do you look for the living among the dead?¬†¬†He is not here; he has risen!

First day of the week was Monday last week and early morning was market open
The women and the spices are us autists with our puts
Jesus is the market
The two men are JPow and Munchman

The prophecy is foretold and everyone knows the story.

TLDR: The market was resurrected for a 3 day rally, but will be dead again next week.  Source: god.

Then immediately set sell orders for 50% above what you paid for them and go back to sleep. The market will spike in the opposite direction at some point and you'll make some tendies. In the meantime, average down on Leaps and shares (ban?) in the companies that you feel have been unjustifiably impacted by beervirus so you stand to make even more tendies when the market recovers.

fqg6xz,Perceptionisprojecti,"Reality check, this isn't a virus problem..... We can fix this in a month or two","&amp;#x200B;

The US is in panic mode. But once we get enough ventilators and experience fighting this,¬† that will stop 90% of deaths. Now that might take another month or two. But once that happens people will be free to wander out their house and cough on you. Why? Because our hospitals won't be flooded to the point of not being able to treat this.¬†

We are having an ill prepared medical system problem this isn't a terrible virus problem.(yea oil..... but...) There will be some fall out from shitty ran small businesses.¬† Some big boys might go under to. The way to inflate the economy and run a business is just pull out more debt to pay off your more near term debt payment. Fuck if landlords that rent to small businesses cannot pay their mortgage¬† that can be serious trouble for the commercial mortgage industry(which has been showing signs of fuck-age coming)........... But this wsb so we need those folks for our puts.

Anyway......

We are not going to eliminate the virus or stop our service people(who've by now encountered the virus and either are spreaders or developed anti bodies by now).  We are simply waiting for enough ventilators and our hospitals to adapt.

Lets get real: I am not a autist.¬† I am a real retard with real self esteem issues that tendies will never fix(but will help me forget said flaws for as long as I can get a hooker to spend time with me).

There are a few theories out right now.

1)Either this will lead to a depression. Our service workers get fucked. Too much defaulting on debt payments and maybe hyper inflation.

2)Or America is great yet again, and our businesses find a way to overcome by producing ventilators, Trump kicks people out of their homes to get back to work and offers BS news to simulate the economy enough to get reelected..... Which means we will have another drop with a another big bull rally to follow up in the next month/two, and it will happen really fast.(Remember Biden==bear life) 

3)most likely to happen: some where in between.

Bull gang buying puts and calls is the only solution.

fqfaek,HelloFromTheSexySide,Powell doesn't need to save the economy to stop your puts from printing,"To all the bears out there who think that we are going into recession. You're right, the fed can't save the economy from going tits up. Printing money obviously doesn't cure the beer sicky, but you know what it does do? Artificially inflate asset prices.  
**YOUR PUTS ARE NOT FUCKING SAFE:** Puts are bets that the **NOMINAL** price of stocks will go down, but the **REAL** value of stocks going down doesn't necessarily mean that their nominal price will go down.

JP has already started flooding the economy with trillions of dollars. Do you REALLY think Trump is just gonna let him stop, especially in an election year? **NO, we are going to have stagflation**.

**That doesn't mean you can't make some money on puts in the short run, but it DOES mean that you need to be careful to not overestimate how far you think the market will fall, because inflation will be working against you.**

To the autists out here who still don't get it, here's a picture with pretty lines to show you what I'm talking about. After Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971 we went through a period of heavy inflation. Over the next decade, the real value of the DJIA (pretty red line) lost over 60% of its value before it bottomed out in 1982. Meanwhile, the nominal price of the DJIA (pretty blue line) bottomed out in 1974 and quickly recouped its losses.

fqeqnz,Timelapze,Note on the dislocation in the Mortgage Backed Securities segment of fixed income,"Note, this is a message I received from my lender. I work in asset management but this is a good note on what‚Äôs been happening in MBS.

*Been in the mortgage industry since 1985. Today will end the craziest week I‚Äôve ever experienced.
 
Here‚Äôs a recap of what‚Äôs occurred:
 
Mortgage investors are so spooked out by cities and businesses shutting and the thought of 20% unemployment that they completely abandoned the mortgage market. Mortgage rates went skyrocketing from an all-time low into the mid 4‚Äôs in just a few days.

The Fed said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶ we will buy all the mortgages like we did in 2008.‚Äù Rates then came crashing back down into the low to mid 3‚Äôs‚Ä¶.in one incredible day.

Fannie and Freddie announced they would allow borrowers to reduce or defer up to 12 mortgage payments with no credit hit. They obviously don‚Äôt want a foreclosure or short sale crisis like 2008. Call your mortgage company for details.
Fannie and Freddie acknowledged that appraisers may be freaked out going into stranger‚Äôs homes so they made it so they don‚Äôt necessarily have to physically inspect the property. They now allow for desktop and drive-by appraisals on some transactions. Mostly owner occupied purchases but some second homes and investment homes too.

The IRS extended the tax deadline to July 15 but then shut down their offices making tax transcripts very challenging to obtain. Lenders must now use alternatives.

Title companies tried to slip in a waiver to give themselves an out for virus issues. Lenders said ‚Äúuh, no,‚Äù but provided other ways to protect the collateral.

Fannie and Freddie told lenders to start being way more cautious. Confirm employment on, or very near, the day of funding, don‚Äôt trust dated documents, make 100% sure the borrower has the ability to repay the loan for the next few years and make sure again at closing. Do not fund loans where you have any doubt even if that means denying loans on closing day.

Congress gave Americans $2 trillion in relief to help get us through the coming weeks or months. 

The jumbo loan market completely melted down. Those loans will be very hard to get going forward and will take way longer to close. Those loans are not backed by the government. Talk to your lender about alternatives.

The non QM market (bank statement loans and alternative doc loans) completely melted down and those loans have nearly all disappeared going forward. Those loans are not backed by the government.
Nearly every down payment assistance program in the nation was suspended. CalHFA in California was just suspended.

Lots of lenders had to make very difficult decline calls to crying borrowers this week‚Ä¶some who were at the closing table ready to sign. Just awful.

FHA and VA loans are struggling for survival. They will make it but with massive changes. Some lenders shut them down. Some Lenders raised credit scores and raised interest rates to limit risk. Congress may need to step in and rumor is they will. 

Most lenders raised they credit rating requirement to 640+.

Not all lenders will make it through this. Some may not make it through next week. Quicken, the nation‚Äôs biggest lender, is rumored to have alerted the government that they may need help to survive.
 
Let‚Äôs hope next week is way less eventful, and less stressful, than this one.

Hang in there. Be patient. Make take a few months but there‚Äôs light at the end of this tunnel.*",89,1585376278,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqeqnz/note_on_the_dislocation_in_the_mortgage_backed/,wallstreetbets,1

fqds6r,dylansavillan,Corona stimulus bill key detail,"As I'm sure you know by now, the Senate passed a 2 trillion dollar Corona relief bill this week. If you're at all curious where that money goes, here's the basic breakdown of it:
1) 560 billion to individuals via cash payment or unemployment benefits 
2) 500 billion in big corporate loans*(we'll get back to this)
3) 377 billion to small businesses loans
4) 340 billion to state and local governments
5) 153 billion for public health

For the most part, this is pretty straightforward. The catch comes when you start looking at the fine text of the big corporate loans. Of the 500 billion, 75 billion will go straight to airlines. The other 425 billion helps capitalize a $4.25 trillion, with a T, leveraged lending facility at the Federal Reserve. The taxpayer dollars would soak up any losses from that lending program.¬†You read that correctly. The Federal Reserve will leverage that freshly printed cash at a 10:1 ratio. It gets worse. So much worse. The only legislated restrictions on companies that take these loans is a temporary ban on stock buybacks. Besides that, they can pretty much do what they want. They're not even held to the same standards small businesses will be of retaining employees on payroll. The government will get no equity in these companies. The money can be used for increased executive compensation, mergers, wholesale purchases of smaller businesses, etc. This bill blows the 2008 700 billion dollar corporate bailout out of the water. So yeah, I guess my DD from reading this is to invest heavily in big time blue chipper once you see us start to recover. The playing field has shifted even more dramatically in their favor. 

TLDR: 500 billion in big buisness loans is actually $4 trillion. Gonna be a feast for the big boys

fqdckc,SpecialtyHamSandwich,The Real Fatality Rate?,"Can‚Äôt trust China. Throw their numbers out. What do you get?

Well - out of total closed cases outside of China (I.e. either the people who have been declared ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù or the people who have died), the fatality rate is approximately 29%.

You read that correctly. Do the math yourself if you don‚Äôt believe me. 

https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

For example, as of 3/27, Italy (where shit has been hitting the fan for a few weeks) had roughly 9100 deaths and 11,000 recoveries (around 45% death). Not great, Bob.

A few potential explanations and things to consider before panicking:

We know a lot of people who are infected haven‚Äôt even been tested and counted as ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases.

Also, the rest of the world is in the earlier stages of the pandemic, and this virus reportedly takes roughly a week to kill someone, but even longer for someone to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù and be not contagious and well enough to be declared a ‚Äúrecovery.‚Äù 

My only point is looking at the overall fatality rate is dumb. This is the number we should be focusing on. How many people are recovering versus how many are dying?

Hopefully this percentage is drastically reduced in the coming weeks. But something to keep an eye on when you‚Äôre deciding on puts or calls.

fqd8m0,LazyMeal,$SPY and why you‚Äôre retarded.,"$SPY is an ETF. This is well known. If you want to invest in $SPY, you‚Äôre actually investing in the top Fortune 500 companies that the world sees fit. This does not include their balance sheets, this does not include the details. What this does include, is the manipulation. Since /r/all joined, you retards are all dead-set on $SPY poots and calls. This is a fallacy, as the index (ETF) has a much higher chance of being manipulated by J-Pow and his giant dick; as compared to individual stocks. 


My advice to you; make calls and poots on stocks rather than $SPY. That way, you aren‚Äôt completed fucked by the manipulation and simple-mindedness of how the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù is moving. Fuck that. I‚Äôm here to make 50x not 1.5x. 


TLDR: Focus on stocks for gains. $SPY and J-Pow will fuck you harder in the long run (if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing)

fqcwdb,rhabdogotmegood,California is so incredibly fucked right now. Massively Under-reported Corona Cases.,"If you thought the reported cases were bad now, just wait until you hear what's happening in Southern California. One of the more popular testing sites and methods (the swab for the sinuses) is currently taking more than 2 weeks to come back from the testing facility. That's right. If you start showing symptoms, you wont' get your results back until AFTER YOUR SYMPTOMS FADE AND AFTER YOU MIGHT HAVE NEEDED HOSPITALIZATION. This whole thing is a massive shitshow for people who can't afford to go to high end testing sites or who lack good health insurance.   


In other words, everything you see in the US is being massively under-reported. The entire west coast is probably 10x-100x more infected than we realize. For example, I was flat out told by the doctor that I most likely have the virus given my symptoms and pre-existing conditions. (deviated septum which means upper respiratory tract crap makes me congested like a motherfucker), which lack of sniffles or sinus issues indicated my current chest pains and cough (which is only getting worse) is not a cold or the flu. Dude sent me to a testing facility last Wednesday and after calling them every day after the ""5 business days"" they still don't have the results of my test. 

If it wasn't for the fact I'm a retard with no friends, I could have been out and about spreading this shit to 100's of other people already. If mods want, I can send them a photo of my ass getting tested along with the emails they have sent me regarding how long the testing is taking.

fqbzgk,Hitlerism,6000 Urns shipped by truck in Bat Soup Land,"(Bloomberg) ‚Äî The long lines and stacks of ash urns greeting family members of the dead at funeral homes in Wuhan are spurring questions about the true scale of coronavirus casualties at the epicenter of the outbreak, renewing pressure on a Chinese government struggling to control its containment narrative.

The families of those who succumbed to the virus in the central Chinese city, where the disease first emerged in December, were allowed to pick up their cremated ashes at eight local funeral homes starting this week. As they did, photos circulated on Chinese social media of thousands of urns being ferried in.

Outside one funeral home, trucks shipped in about 2,500 urns on both Wednesday and Thursday, according to Chinese media outlet Caixin. Another picture published by Caixin showed 3,500 urns stacked on the ground inside. It‚Äôs unclear how many of the urns had been filled.

People who answered the phone at six of the eight funeral homes in Wuhan said they either did not have data on how many urns were waiting to be collected, or were not authorized to disclose the numbers. Calls were not answered at the other two.

""I feel really angry."" Two residents of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, discuss their frustration and the death of whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang.

Some families said they had been forced to wait for several hours to pick up the ashes. The photos circulated as mass deaths from the virus spiked in cities across the west, including Milan, Madrid and New York, where hospitals were erecting tents to handle the overflow as global infections soar past 500,000, with 24,000 dead.


According to Chinese government figures, 2,535 people in Wuhan have died of the virus. The announcement that a lockdown in place since January would be lifted came after China said its tally of new cases had hit zero and stepped up diplomatic outreach to other countries hard hit by the virus, sending some of them medical supplies.",8,1585364274,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqbzgk/6000_urns_shipped_by_truck_in_bat_soup_land/,wallstreetbets,1

fqbphs,robo_jojo_77,"[DD] UW Med Center projects April 6 to be peak resource use in NYC, April 14 for nation","Disclaimer: I'm not an epidemiologist, just a normie engineer who likes math. However I've been paying a lot of attention to the PhD epidemiologists and MDs here in Seattle, and I thought I'd share a few things they've linked.

So UW Medical Center has been on top of this shit since the very beginning.  They have a highly-esteemed epidemiology program, and most of their predictions have come true so far.  I trust them; the only reason Seattle isn't an absolute catastrophe like NYC is because of UW Med Center and Fred Hutch sounding the alarm early, and everyone here listening to them (unlike the rest of the country...).

They released a new tool using epidemiology models, attempting to predict peak resource use:

https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

This tool is really useul and morbidly fascinating, it provides a ton of information.

Note that this isn't predicting # of infections, it's focusing on hospitalizations and deaths.  Why? Well as everyone in this sub knows, the data we have on # of infections is both noisy and likely inaccurate due to lack of testing.  Building models on inaccurate data generally doesn't end well.  But hospitalizations and deaths are a pretty good indicator of how bad things are going to get, and they aren't affected by test shortages as much. And the lack of hospital beds and ventilators is why we shut down the economy in the first place (thus most useful for trading IMO). 

Some takeaways after playing with this tool:
* They predict we'll need 231k beds, 35k ICU beds, and 19k ventilators nationwide
* They predict a shortage of ~50k beds, ~15k ICU beds, and ~19k ventilators nationwide
* They predict 80k people will die nationwide (yikes)
* This is a *model*, and like all models, there is still a lot of uncertainty as to what will actually happen IRL.  The real world is more complex.  Thus, the model includes *confidence intervals*. For those too dumb to know what that means, it means the numbers I wrote above are expected values, but it could be a lot better or a lot worse based on the data we have right now.  Just like weather models, as time moves on, these confidence intervals should start to get smaller and smaller, reflecting increasing certainty.
  * The number of beds needed could range between 118k to 465k.  If it's on the higher end, then we'll have a MUCH higher hospital bed shortage. If it's on the lower end, we might get out of this without a ton of people dying.
   * Do NOT bitch at scientists in three weeks if the expected value is not precise.  Only bitch at them if it's outside of these confidence intervals.  (Even then, they're doing the best they can, so maybe just be nice?)
* Peak resource usage (based on predicted # of hospitalizations) **will be on April 14 for the country**.  If the true values end up in the middle or upper end of the confidence interval, we can expect people to start dying in the ER lobby or at home a few days before this. Maybe base your trading decisions around this date. 
  * You can also drill into this data by state, which shows that NY is absolutely fucked, and the South isn't looking great either. **NY's peak resource date is also projected to come earlier than the rest of the country (April 6)**, so keep that in mind. 
* The model is based on the current orders from state governments (school's being closed, non-essential-businesses being closed, and stay-at-home orders).  If state governments add more restrictions (like travel bans) or lift restrictions, this model's predictions will change.
  * THE CURVE ONLY STAYS FLAT IF THESE ORDERS ARE KEPT IN PLACE. Even after April, if these orders are lifted you can expect the curve to go back up again.  Maybe heat will slow it down, but that's unclear, and the summer won't last forever anyway.

The big question I have is, how much of this priced in?  Who the fuck knows.  News out of NYC is already bleak, so maybe that part is priced in.  I don't think the market realizes how bad it's gonna hit the rest of the country though.  I'm also sure boomers are not paying attention to this UW Med Center tool, considering they've ignored everything UW Med has said so far.  

Here are my positions.  I'm still holding puts from last week, which have fucked me, and doubled down this week. I'm a bit worried about my 4/24 puts cause of theta and the IV crush, but I'm thinking the others will be fine. 

DIS $80p 4/24

fqb9sr,tslGUH,ETFs are Derivatives,"Alright. That other dude had that long rant about ETFs and he's not wrong.  I think going batshit over $SPY falling to shit might be a little bit of alarmism, but for less liquid underlying products definitely a real concern (the bond ETFs got real outta whack recently).  So here's how ETFs actually work, why they're derivatives, and why you might be left holding the bag.

ETFs are not shares of any actual stonk.  And they aren't even backed by shares of actual stonks.  ETFs are little pieces of paper that the big motherfucker market makers can consolidate and cash in for actual stonks.

&amp;#x200B;

How does it work?  Well let me tell you

(1) A big motherfucker buys up a shitton of the stonks that make up the S&amp;P index that $SPY tracks

(2) Big motherfucker goes up to the etf machine and says: yo, here's stonk

(3) The etf machine takes those stocks and gives the big motherfucker market maker 50,000 little pieces of paper that are the $SPY

(4) The big motherfucker then sells those little etf pieces of paper to you retards

&amp;#x200B;

This can also be done in reverse.  The big motherfucker can buy up 50,000 pieces of the etf shares from you retards and take them to the etf machine to get the underlying stocks.  How do the big motherfuckers make money off this?  Arbitrage.  Let's say $SPY is going for $200/share because bloody monday ripped you gay bulls a new one.  That would mean 50,000 etf pieces of paper would cost retail traders a cool $10 million.  But if the big motherfucker can buy the all the underlying stocks for $9.9 million, get the etf papers, and sell them to you autists, then they just made $100k doing diddly.  And what if $SPY is trading for $200 and it costs $10.1 million for the underlying?  Retail traders can get fucked again because the big motherfucker is going to buy up all your etf papers for $10 million and get $10.1 million of stonks.  Again, they make a cool $100k doing diddly.

&amp;#x200B;

Why does this matter for you?  Because you can't do jack shit with your etf piece of paper besides sell it to a bigger idiot than you.  And since you're on wallstreetbets, you're probably the biggest retard in the room.  Your little etf paper is fucking worthless unless some market maker is doing the arbitrage necessary to support the etf market.  For something where the underlying securities are wicked liquid like the S&amp;P 500 this isn't as big a concern because market makers know they'll be able to unload their shares for more than they bought your etf papers for.  But when you go to illiquid markets and shit is hitting the fan, the market makers aren't going to be sure that they'll be able to unload their $10 million in shit tier corporate bonds for a higher price so they won't enter the market.  If nobody is converting those etf papers into bonds and bonds into etf papers, then your etf papers are as good as the green toilet paper the Fed is currently printing.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr ETFs are derivatives and if they track an illiquid market a big ass drop might fuck you.",75,1585361494,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqb9sr/etfs_are_derivatives/,wallstreetbets,1

Ominous names right?! With good reason. I‚Äôm sure many of you are already aware of these signals but for those who are not these are MAJOR reversal signals.

The photo is of the 1 Day $SPY chart

Within the yellow circle is what is known as the ‚ÄúGravestone Doji,‚Äù a Doji is when a given candlestick has an almost equal open and close. When combined with long ‚Äúwicks,‚Äù the Inter day swings, it forms the Doji. Essentially what this signals is that buyers and sellers are equally matched. A Gravestone Doji is when the body of the candle is to the bottom half. This signifies what direction the momentum is headed, in this case downward. You can also notice that this is on a day that we had broke down through the uptrend of the week.

Within the red circle you will see a green line (50 Day Simple Moving Average) and a yellow line (200 Day Simple Moving Average) These track the average share price across an applied time frame, in this case 50 and 200 days. These averages are used to track short and long term support. When the 50 day SMA crosses the 200 SMA it forms what is called a ‚ÄúDeath Cross‚Äù it means that short term support has crossed long term support. In other words we will have lost any long term support keeping the underlying propped up. This signal has predicted mass sell off very relatable in most of the major recessions of the last century 1929, 1938, 1974 and 2008.

Let me tell you now, fuck no. Monday is going to be green as fuck. Dildos launching to fucking Mars. Always inverse WSB retards for tendies. 

Here's why:

* Fed's going to print unlimited tendies
* Boomers holding cash on the sidelines will enter knowing the power of the fed has their backs
* Bill got signed and checks and bailouts will be reinvested into local business and stonks
* Trump's bitch is the market and JPow too
* NY has enough vents now (their asses forgot about the delivery from the feds which was stuck in a warehouse)
* The wuflu is just a fucking flu
* China has 0 new cases

Monday is going to be a fucking blood bath for you bear fuckers. Get your assholes ready.

Many of us are new on this specific sub. Taking a moment to think, I cannot figure one sub on all of Reddit like it. This sub is so unique and so powerful. It brings together the very poor and the very wealthy. The risk takers and the risk adverse. Nuclear physicists and cocaine dealers. Old and young, of all races, shapes, and sizes. 
Wall Street Bets and the market have zero biases. The intelligent can lose everything, the autists can make extraordinary gains.

We see it week after week. 

10k to 100k
50k to 800k
I just saw a post where a guy said $60 took him to 90k in 2 months and one where a guy took $900 to 18k in 15 minutes. 

We are living in a time where a near infinite amount of money is changing hands at an unfathomable pace. 

We can make life-changing gains in what feels like a few revolution of the Earth on its axis. 

With that being said...

Where there are huge gains, there are going to be huge losses. Most of you on this thread are losing money. By most, I would estimate 75%-85%. Some of you are new here, some of you have been here a while and can‚Äôt figure it out.

I want to say, from my own great and tragic experience... it‚Äôs okay. Some of life‚Äôs most peaceful moments don‚Äôt require anything but a desire. It does not require money to go sit down by the creek and listen to the water pour through the rock bed. You don‚Äôt need money to go out into the woods and listen to nature speak specifically to you. 

You have the choice from this very moment forward to due your diligence and learn why some people are making thousands of dollars each trade, over and over again, 60%+ of the time.

Some of you coming from a sports betting background, a poker background, a bartering background. You wouldn‚Äôt go into a game or a trade without knowing who‚Äôs playing, or what the value of each item was worth would you? Use your ability to scan a valuable situation to your advantage.

Some of you come from a mathematical, engineering, or physics background. You wouldn‚Äôt try to solve a problem with no tools, history basis, or outside sources would you? Use your ability to problem solve and reverse engineer to figure out where we are, how we got here, and how it appears we are going to move forward.

We have artists, and dancers, and musicians, and tradesmen. Use your precision for the technical aspects in your everyday trading.

Most importantly, be as patient as a tiger stalking its prey. Some people will get super lucky. Most will not. This is not free and you will most likely, not get a free pass.

I share this in an attempt to grab the focus of a group of people who see this as a possibility to leave a life of financial troubles behind, and those who want to build on a profitable future. 

I am not providing you with any financial advice, or technical analysis. I will see the respect in those of you who call me a fellow autist or ask for me to get banned. At first I didn‚Äôt understand the humor here, but I have found myself laughing profusely at this forum and I love it. But with the humor, you have to find the moments to be serious and that is when your hard earned money and your priceless time is involved.

If anyone is looking for a mentee, I‚Äôm looking for a mentor or group of like minded people who want to discuss both financials, and overcoming challenges on a daily basis. Drop me a line.

For the rest of you, happy trading, stay safe, and figure good fortunes for yourself.",215,1585357904,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqaaow/lets_take_a_minute_and_think_logically_here/,wallstreetbets,1

fqa3sf,fudgemin,ZM- Zoom Video Communications DD,"\-March 4 2020 Zoom announced previous quarter earnings, which are highlighted [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/04/1995406/0/en/Zoom-Video-Communications-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Financial-Results.html).

\- ‚ÄúZoom has added 3.5x more MAUs YTD \[year to date\] than the same period of 2019 (2.22 vs. 0.64 million), so even with half the normal paid user conversion rate, this would still yield 74% y/y growth in paid user adds YTD,‚Äù they wrote. '

\- The company added 2.22 million monthly active users so far in 2020, while in 2019 it added 1.99 million.

\-Is no big news that corona is causing a huge spike in Zoom user base. However this report was from March 4, quite early compared to the relative widespread chaos we see now. March 10-15 was when North America started going on lockdown.

\-One religious group, The Jehovah Witnesses(my parents sadly) have stopped there church gatherings. The are going to be holding the church meetings(3 times a week) from video application, you guess it, Zoom. 

\-That is 1.2 million JW in USA, another 250k in Canada, all connecting with the Zoom app, 3 times a week starting like last week or this week. I don't even count other countries, who are also advised to follow the same procedure. 

\-April Is the Memorial of Jesus, the JW most attended ceremony. Last year 2.5 million attended alone in the USA. This year it's the first year ever to be held from individuals homes, all tied together using the Zoom application. On Wed April 8, Zoom app will have 2.5+ JW's alone,  just after sundown. 

\-They will be using the app till this shitstorm is over

\-March 4 Stock ticks at $116, goes to $125 the next day or earnings report. Consensus was -0.01, actual was 0.05 EPS. Again, this report ends fiscal JAN 2020.

\-March 6 onward stock heads south with rest of market, towards $110

\-Then Papa announces free money for the world, fire up the printers, and the ticker booms to $160, drops down to $135 the next day.

Well what does all that mean? i dont have the slightest fucking clue. I just watch the lines go up and down and tune in for the first class stories, Yolo retards and the gay babies but i thought maybe someone else on here could make sense of tis all?

If i was i betting man and didnt think the world was going to collapse in a few months, I would go hard long on this fucker. If this bitch can rally to $160 from fake money, Just imagine what actual real money will do? 

Zacks has it at #3. Most condenses are flat EPS, which is straight bipolar. They beat last report by 0.06 a share. This report in June will be up until like april-may. Will hit .10 a share. Send that ticker into the 2 hundos.

Estimated next report dates is June 4, 2020. Going time for expiration. I mean that is if the whole fucking market does explode.

It's been about 1-2 weeks for most people in the US and longer for other parts of the world to be on somewhat of a lockdown.....people will handle this differently. Call your mom, call your wife's boyfriend's ex husband, that friend from college, someone. You'll feel better, you'll make them feel better, but also find out what's happening in their area and do your own research. Find out what companies are doing, who's getting laid off, who's still working etc. 

I originally was going write this as a DD post, but we all know this.....hospitals are fucked. I just called my cousin, who I haven't spoken to in a while, as he works at Long Beach Memorial Hospital (that's Los Angeles for our fuzzy foreigners). But, he obviously said, ""Shits getting fucking crazy as hell."" They are running out of everything, vents, gloves, nurses are putting on old N95s then putting an old hospital mask over it. An entire floor converted to Covid-19 and it's already full. LA is about 1-2 weeks away from NY and most hospitals in LA are already stuggling. Then he drives around and beaches and parks are full to the max; some people are taking is seriously, but most people aren't giving a shit. But we all know this.....we aren't flatting the curve enough, hospitals are fucked, people will die, puts will print...so I thought I'd bring up something else here.   

Maybe don't check futures till Sunday, close pornhub for 30 min and give someone a call this weekend.... check in with them, make sure they are alright, and see what's happening in their area.

Here is the USO chart.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/PknRcKi2/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PknRcKi2/)

Fundamentals - Some fucking deal is going to be made with the Russians and Saudis possibly by next presidential term.

Price points: 

Sub $5.00 seems like a good starting entry point. 

Looks like it can hit $2.00ish before rebounding - another good entry point.

Expected rise $6 -$9

Depending on how you want to play this, I'd think selling &lt;30 day expiration 3.50 Put + buy half the amount of shares , would be a good  first entry point.

Or just load up $6.00 calls if the price hits the target buy area within that time frame.",28,1585356684,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq9ykw/lets_see_how_this_plays_out_part_2_uso_chart/,wallstreetbets,1

fq9lnz,fuk_normies,Federal Reserve - Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility Terms - Beer Flu/Corporate Bond Crisis and SPY ETF collapse - A Bears Wet Dream,"The Fed has partnered with BlackRock to buy individual corporate bonds and corporate bond ETF‚Äôs‚Äîthink $VCSH And $LQD

However, the Fed cheat code isn‚Äôt as easy as unlimited buying of corporate bond ETF‚Äôs outright on the market, it comes with terms and conditions 

[Terms ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200323b2.pdf)

*Important points:*

- Fed will not buy more than 20% of qualified ETF‚Äôs

- Fed will only buy fair market value and not buy when the price exceeds the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying portfolio 

- Fed will stop buying unless program is extended on September 30th, 2020 

*What this means:*

Fed is providing liquidity when certain corporate bond ETF‚Äôs drop below a certain threshold, money printer goes BRRR when market price is below NAV 

Printer is turned off when market price is above NAV 

This helps slow down large falls or ignite massive green dildos 

The Fed is capping themselves to 20% ownership of assets 

This means IF and ONCE they reach 20% threshold, the money printer goes OFF

I don‚Äôt think they think this is possible before September 30th, 2020, to be 20% committed by then, otherwise money printer would turn off and they‚Äôd stop adding liquidity and be useless 

*How to play with the Fed short term:*

Buy corporate bond ETF‚Äôs that qualify under its terms when their market price is below NAV, that‚Äôs when money printer goes BRRRRR

VCSH, LQD are likely 

*Interesting Points:* 

The Fed at this point has taken unprecedented and extreme measures against the beer flu in records time. Remember how slow the Fed normally acts it‚Äôs policies. 

This time they‚Äôre scared... Market crashes are annoying yes, but they‚Äôre part of the economic cycle. The Fed is shitting their pants about this market crash. But why? 

Trump and Fed keep reiterating this is NOT A financial crisis but a medical crisis. I call bull shit. The Fed has had to run repo operations to maintain liquidity in the repo markets these last couple years with intense programs recently. Something is not right in the financial system

Think of a house plumbing system, water flows smoothly‚Äî ‚ÄúA‚Äù OK‚Äîwater gets blocked somewhere‚ÄîKABOOM 

Money flow is being blocked somewhere in the financial system

JPM was the likely cause this time just a few months ago when repo rates jumped 10%

JPM declared it was because of reserve ratio laws enacted since 2008 and tax payments withholding that they had to stop loaning money in the repo market where the Fed had to step in and unplug the block 

Remember the Fed has now lowered reserve ratios to 0. Interest rates 0. They‚Äôre now buying fucking ETF‚Äôs 

This shows the Fed is extremely worried about something in the market 

There is a pile of dog shit somewhere in the financial system, similar to CDO‚Äôs of 2008

Might be the corporate bonds that banks don‚Äôt want as collateral in the repo market causing a freeze, in which case the Fed steps into buy them. But I think corporate bonds are just a spark to the real gasoline lying in the financial markets‚ÄîETF‚Äôs 

WSB God Michael Burry compared ETF‚Äôs to CDO‚Äôs 

[Michael Burry compares ETF‚Äôs to CDO‚Äôs](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos)


[Research paper‚ÄîETF‚Äôs account for 10% of Market but 20% of short interest](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)

And a very controversial article by Andrew Bogan pHD. 

[Can ETF‚Äôs collapse](http://boganassociates.com/whitepapers.html)

This shit is over my autistic head but some loophole of ETF shorting involved with stock creation and redemption can cause them to collapse quickly under intense selling pressure. Which means they can‚Äôt handle an aggressive bear market. 

So...

Why is the Fed all of the sudden stepping in to buy corporate bond ETF‚Äôs and throwing the kitchen sink at the problem? They are literally shaking in their boots. JPow, Fed Chair, doing an interview on the Today show FFS to reassure the American people 

I think it‚Äôs because ETF‚Äôs have produced the capability for a MASSIVE stock market crash, likes of which we‚Äôve never seen 

All it takes is a spark: Let‚Äôs call it Beer flu 

Beer flu hits‚Äîeconomy halts, corporate bonds become a hot potato, nobody wants to hold. Repo market freezes at points where corporate bonds are collateral. Liquidity crisis ensues. 

Fed needs to fix this and contain this quickly 

Or else this hits the broader market and causes ETF‚Äôs to collapse 

Now why would the Fed care so much about ETF‚Äôs? They‚Äôre just another ol‚Äô financial product out of thousands on the market, and all they do is track the real market 

I think it has something to do with the ETF custodians

If they fail, for example if SPY fails, their custodian, in this case State Street Corp and a bank considered ‚Äútoo big to fail,‚Äù could fall. BlackRock, Vanguard, are custodians to iShares and Vanguard index‚Äôs. 

‚ÄúMy wild card gamble:*

Call me crazy... BUT 

State Street Bank had its stress test, the Fed passed them, but told them they‚Äôd be at risk of bankruptcy if under market stress their largest trading partner or counterparty defaulted‚ÄîFed doesn‚Äôt say who this is, and they know sensitive information about all these players 

Current market conditions under beer flu are WORSE then the Feds stress test‚Äîmeaning State Streets counterparty could be in big trouble of defaulting as Fed has pointed out 

Scenario: 

Coronavirus causes corporate bonds to go to shit, repo market freezes, liquidity dries up, volatility takes off

Intense shorting of SPY ETF could cause a counterparty Authorized Participant (AP) of State Street to collapse‚Äîthis could be a market maker or other financial institution that‚Äôs working with State Street in the creation and redemption process which maintains SPY.

State Street is considered too big to fail. Meaning if they fall, it would cause global shock to the financial systems 

My hunch says, SPY ETF is at risk and so is State Street if market volatility picks up beyond a certain threshold which causes the ETF to collapse 

The Fed is buying individual corporate bonds and corporate bond ETF‚Äôs as a way to prop the markets collectively but doing so in a way that doesn‚Äôt point to the true problem they have‚ÄîETF collapses in a bear market‚Äîcausing ‚ÄúToo big to fail‚Äù banks to collapse

Tl;dr: The very nature of ETF creation and redemption mechanism makes it susceptible to easily collapse under extreme selling. Michael Burry compares ETF‚Äôs to CDO‚Äôs of 2008. SPY ETF and it‚Äôs custodian State Street could be at risk. Probably why the Fed is acting wildly to protect ETF liquidity.

It has been a wild ride with some serious dips and I certainly never expected to see &gt;150,000% (Is this a record of some sort?) returns since I bought my first MSFT call back in the first week of February. I made the majority of my money on SPY puts over the past few weeks including 40k worth that I purchased yesterday and sold this morning at open. Best of luck to you all and I'll continue to lurk here. No current positions so don't come at me with that.

fq972q,LeeSinIsMyDaddy,This is how I see the start to this week playing out. DD inside.,"Futures are going to limit down on Sunday night all the way through Monday morning. All of WSB holding puts will be cumming uncontrollably in their pants at 9:13 am. At 9:14, you‚Äôll hear a very light hum coming from outside. You‚Äôll try to ignore it, thinking it‚Äôs just a utility worker fixing something. It slowly picks up in volume until all of a sudden, you hear an impossibly loud BRRRRRT! Disoriented by the sheer loudness of the noise, you‚Äôll run outside and try to make sense of what‚Äôs making that horrible, deafening sound. Upon seeing nothing that could be making such a noise, you‚Äôll look back to your phone and see that SPY starts to make the most abrupt V you‚Äôve ever seen while it was at -8.13%. Before you can even compose yourself and figure out what the fuck is going on, an amber alert goes off on your iPhone. A video starts auto-playing of Jeremy Powell dressed in joker makeup, cackling like he‚Äôs a regular in Arkham Asylum. He‚Äôs laughing and howling like a lunatic while he mimics the sound of an A-10 warthog. ‚ÄúBRRRRRT HAHAHAHA! BRRRRRRRT ü§°‚Äù.




Everything fades to black. You fainted from the sheer stress of the situation. When you finally wake up, you‚Äôre dazed and confused.

fq94w3,MortalDionysus,What WSB is missing...,"I'm reposting a longish post I wrote in response to a thread called ""What are we missing?"" It's a weird quirk of human nature that people ask things like ""what are we missing,"" and when someone steps up and tells them things they could be missing, they say ""no ur wrong, I'm right.""

First let me take this opportunity to post a pic I've been trying to post a week now but never gets approved. This is a warning against hivemind thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

[WSB Then vs. WSB Now...](https://preview.redd.it/qpwm00gl0bp41.png?width=1797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37382dc57fc6767a8313b6a9d0b7bd14cd00504d)

So, what are we missing? Why isn't the market tanking? Here are some points to consider...

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the market is already down 30%+. It's not like NOTHING has changed. The market tanked faster than it has ever tanked in history. Keep that in mind.

Corona virus created hysteria. And yes, that's what it is, hysteria. It has killed a whopping 27,000 world wide.

Just imagine you woke up from a coma, and the whole world was panicking over a virus, and you asked how many were dead, and they told you 27,000 (SO FAR!!!). You would think the world had gone insane.

All you have are models and predictions and estimates of what COULD happen. But most likely those models and predictions you are buying are all wrong. It's not as serious as you WANT IT TO BE.

Unemployment has skyrocketed, yes. But that is TEMPORARY unemployment due to a TEMPORARY lockdown. Once businesses open up the unemployment stats will tank overnight. Of course some businesses will close permanently. I'm not saying it's all sunshine and roses here. The point is it's not as bad as everyone WANTS it to be.

And yes, printing money just fucking works. The Fed can print and print and print and nothing is stopping them except hyperinflation, which we are nowhere near yet. You can prop up any company, any market, with trillions in QE and bailouts.

**TL;DR- You are not being objective here. You think you are, but you aren't. You want the economy to tank, you want corona to be worse than it is, you want your puts to print. Wanting it to be true doesn't make it true.**

We are gonna be fine, everything will be back to normal in a couple months.

And all the people who were wrong about MILLIONS OF DEATHS will find their excuses. ""Being hysterical was the RIGHT thing to do. It was the SMART assessment given our (wrong) data at the time. Don't blame ME for the data being wrong!"" etc.",73,1585353826,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq94w3/what_wsb_is_missing/,wallstreetbets,1

Japan for a week or so believed itself almost immune to COVID-19 - there were multiple things on twitter blowing up about how people were saying that because the Japanese were hygenic and washed their hands/wore masks regularly the Virus hadn't spread rapidly. However, a lot of other people believed that they were actually artificially keeping the numbers low because they wanted the Olympics to go ahead (there were reports of a lot of people being turned away for testing).  
&gt;

It was just a single contract, because I can only bench 10 pounds right now. I studied the trade in depth, did a ton of research, put the trade on, and now am second guessing the trade. I found a bearish divergence on the RSI on the 2 and 4 hour chart. Should I just sell the contract and cut my losses?

fq7qt4,Global-Quiet,Don't get caught in the crowd,"In 2015 I put on a trade in the Euro / Swiss Franc exchange rate.  The reason for this trade was obvious to everyone at the time - the Swiss National Bank pledged to defend the level of 1.20 with unlimited buying power.  In other words, they would not let it fall below 1.20 - so buying it was a ""can't lose"" trade.

https://imgur.com/4EjduYK 

But here's the catch - everyone had on the same trade.  Market sentiment indicated that up to 97% of all traders had on the exact same trade.  In other words, the market was very one-sided in how it was feeling and trading.

In early 2015, the SNB decided not to defend the 1.20 exchange rate and the unthinkable happened.  Within the space of seconds, the EUR/CHF collapsed by around 30% in one of the biggest currency moves in the history of foreign exchange.

https://imgur.com/N8qIvd1 

This wiped out thousands of traders and brought down brokerages and funds.   The reason for this sharp move was that lots of traders had stops under 1.20 and the stop selling resulted in more stops being hit.  I was fortunate enough to have closed out of the trade the week prior because I didn't feel comfortable in the position, but the small size I had on would have completely wiped out my account.

The lesson is this: if you find yourself agreeing with the crowd that something is absolutely going to happen, be warned.  Think through what could go wrong and how fast the market can move against you as the crowd runs for the exits.

TLDR - If you find yourself trading with the crowd, be very cautious",77,1585349324,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq7qt4/dont_get_caught_in_the_crowd/,wallstreetbets,1

fq7f3m,jartek,FAQ about the WSB Championship,"I put together a list of frequently asked questions regarding the event that have been floating around in various comment threads, and also give some more details into how it will work.

#**What‚Äôs the WSB Championship?**

Here‚Äôs the [promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpj2632C1SY)

It‚Äôs a live tournament that will be held at the [Esports Stadium Arlington](https://esportsstadium.gg) in October 28-30 -- where 12 contestants will compete using stock options, real money and live trading.  The event will sell tickets to host a live audience of approximately 2,500 people, and will also be live streamed, available online through pay-per-view.

You can learn more about it by visiting **[wallstreetbets.net](https://wallstreetbets.net)**

#**Why will it be in Texas?**

ESA is the newest and biggest Esports venue in the US.  It‚Äôs a facility that was built specifically for esports and has all the latest technology and infrastructure which is needed to host this type of event. 

#**Is it real**?

Yes.  Here are some reputable news sources that have written about it:

* [Nobody Wants a Margin Call Right Now]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-03-26/money-stuff-nobody-wants-a-margin-call-right-now) - Bloomberg (by Matt Levine)

* [Esports Stadium Arlington to Host Stock Options Trading Championship]( https://esportsobserver.com/esports-stadium-arlington-wsb) ‚Äì Esports Observer

* [Wild markets set stage for winner-take-all trading competition]( https://www.investmentnews.com/wild-markets-trading-competition-190598) - Investment News

* WSB Announces First Live Trading Championship ‚Äì (Press Release) found on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-110000567.html), [AP](https://apnews.com/Business%20Wire/44bde858888d487c85e29a442c1ede6a), [Street Insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business+Wire/WallStreetBets+Announces+First+Live+Trading+Championship/16665169.html), [Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/WallStreetBets-Announces-First-Live-Trading-Championship--30256362/), [BusinessWire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200326005099/en/WallStreetBets-Announces-Live-Trading-Championship), [Digital Journal](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4633412), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/03/b15670385/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-championship)

#**How will the contestants be picked? How can I apply?**

We will open up contestant applications in the coming weeks along with any requirements (relevant citizenship, 18 years old, etc‚Ä¶).  At that point we will also list out the rules and criteria which will used for the selection.  There will be ‚Äúqualifier rounds‚Äù which will be fully transparent and open to the public to watch.  At the end of the process, we will have the final contestants for the WSB Championship.

Contestants will deposit a predetermined amount of money into a personal broker account which will be used for the competition.  Anything they make (or lose) during the competition will be theirs, in addition to the prize money awarded to the winner.

#**What‚Äôs the prize?**

The prize will be big, between 6 and 7 figures.  The final amount will be announced in the coming weeks.

#**How are you paying for it?**

The prize money is coming from the primary sponsor of the event, [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30).  This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:  
&gt; True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.

#**What about the beer virus?**

We‚Äôre seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.

#**Do you have a lawyer?**

Yes.  Many of them.

#**You‚Äôre going to get options banned for everyone**

Derivative market is 17 times greater than the actual equities market.  Estimated to be around $1.2 quadrillion dollars globally (although not all with options).  If 12 people get together and legally trade them for a couple days shuts down that market, then the financial system has bigger problems on its hands than WSB. 

#**You‚Äôre drawing too much attention to WSB, the world will find out we exist now!**

People on WSB have been worried about the [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect since 2012, and I don‚Äôt blame them.  In fact there‚Äôs a list of about 100 spinoff subreddits I‚Äôve collected throughout the years, which [I posted about recently]( https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm4yzq/fake_wsbelite_spinoff/).  The fact is we have a big mod team and they do all sorts of things behind the scenes (and a terrific job at that) to make sure the sub quality stays on par with its growth rate.

fq6tol,AvgJoeCrypto,We are experiencing the end game of the great debt super cycle,"Op-Ed by Scott Minerd, Guggenheim CIO
Full CNBC article link below. Here is an excerpt:

‚ÄúIn the wake of that crisis, governments themselves have become highly indebted, requiring virtually continuous support from central banks to acquire that debt to maintain low interest rates to support growth. The average ratio of government debt to GDP for G-7 economies reached 117% in 2019, up from 81% in 2007. Any attempt to taper or reverse the accumulation of government debt or other assets is quickly reversed as financial markets become unruly and economies slow.

Now faced with the exogenous shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers are returning to the same tools employed in the financial crisis a decade ago. They are desperately searching for programs that will fill the demand gap created by massive shutdowns and travel restrictions while simultaneously finding ways to prop up businesses that to a large degree are overly indebted as a result of artificially low interest rates from the past decade.

The ultimate policy goal is to stabilize the economy by salvaging industries that will need to provide employment when the pandemic ends. Given the high level of leverage in these companies, any gaps in cashflow will make it impossible for many companies to service their debt. *The total debt of U.S. non-financial businesses has grown by about $6 trillion since 2007, while cash on hand has only grown by $1.7 trillion. A big driver of that debt growth has been buying back stock.*

Lending these companies more money will only compound the long run problem resulting from over-leverage and make the companies even more vulnerable to failure in the long run.

We are experiencing the end game of the great debt super cycle. As the private sector has become increasingly over-levered, the baton is being passed to the public sector where resources are so strained that the printing press has become the last resort.‚Äù

fq6rid,Noobmast3r69,"""""A More China-Centric Globalization""","#### 

&gt;It  will only accelerate a change that had already begun: a move away from  U.S.-centric globalization to a more China-centric globalization.         
&gt;  
&gt;Why will this trend continue? The American population has lost faith  in globalization and international trade. Free trade agreements are  toxic, with or without U.S. President Donald Trump. By contrast, China  has not lost faith. Why not? There are deeper historical reasons.  Chinese leaders now know well that China‚Äôs century of humiliation from  1842 to 1949 was a result of its own complacency and a futile effort by  its leaders to cut it off from the world. By contrast, the past few  decades of economic resurgence were a result of global engagement. The  Chinese people have also experienced an explosion of cultural  confidence. They believe they can compete anywhere.  
&gt;  
&gt;Consequently, as I document in my new book, *Has China Won?*,  the United States has two choices. If its primary goal is to maintain  global primacy, it will have to engage in a zero-sum geopolitical  contest, politically and economically, with China. However, if the goal  of the United States is to improve the well-being of the American  people‚Äîwhose social condition has deteriorated‚Äîit should cooperate with  China. Wiser counsel would suggest that cooperation would be the better  choice. However, given the toxic U.S. political environment toward  China, wiser counsel may not prevail.A More China-Centric Globalization

&gt;The risks that many workers‚Äîin supermarkets or delivering goods‚Äîface from the coronavirus hit home as news broke that a New York City Uber driver died on Wednesday. His family reportedly said he had taken a sick person from Kennedy airport a few weeks ago, before falling ill himself.
&gt;The death is sure to inflame a bitter argument about whether Uber drivers, like other gig workers, should be treated as employees and therefore qualify for unemployment insurance and maybe health insurance. Washington‚Äôs coronavirus aid package temporarily expands unemployment benefits to ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers. But that won‚Äôt solve the long-term problem.

**TLDR**

Uber dude drove a sick person to the airport, caught the beer virus, and died. Ride sharing is cancelled.

Calls? Am I fucking retarded? Absolutely.

The quarter ends on Tuesday. Companies need to look good for financial reports and CEO's need this quarter to be as green as possible to protect their bonuses. 

Who the fuck cares if people are dying? As long as the lines go up and to the green, who the fuck cares? Besides, old people are expected to die for the Dow anyways.

Speaking of the Dow, it should have been falling from the sky instead of skyrocketing after the jobless claims report and from increases in cases but did it? 

No, and a lot of gay bears got killed as a result.

If you honestly believe Monday is going to be red, then ask yourself this:

Why weren't things bloody on Thursday and why did Dow futures RISE after the jobless claims report?

If you have DIS puts like me, one useful source of information is Clownfish TV youtube channel. These are (I believe) former disney employees who regularly read the disney blogs and have many contacts w/ disney insiders. They detail alot of the financial moves the company is making. Disney is in very serious financial distress.  


Follow the daily bad news coming from disney insiders here:

Whenever I‚Äôm inside my dads are both working from home with monitors they bought. So I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs a good chance with lawn care sales going up along with technology sales. I‚Äôm thinking of investing in Circuit City and Sears. Since both of those companies crushed it after 08 I‚Äôm thinking they do the same and make 2020 a record year.

fq4s5v,mildlyburner,[DD] RIFs (Layoffs) Incoming. We've only seen the tip of the iceberg,"I work at a large VC/PE fund--one of the largest in the US--on the investing team. This absolutely does not make me a public markets expert AT ALL. That said...

Just talked to our firm's talent partner. Her job is to help all of our portfolio companies with sourcing top exec talent, designing hiring plans, etc. Lately, all of her conversations with portcos have been about RIFs (layoffs). I asked her the following three questions: 

1. What % of our companies are talking about layoffs? Answer: 65%
2. What % of those companies have actually executed on any layoffs? Answer: 10%
3. Do you expect the other 90% to actually go through with the layoffs and if yes when? Answer: yes, almost all of them. Most next week 

Counterintuitively, the stimulus bill that was passed today may actually cause a spike in layoffs next week. This is because in order to get the government loan forgiven (aka free money), you are not allowed to layoff more than 25% of headcount \*from the time you get the loan\* (and if you do a layoff after you get the loan but it's &lt;25% of your FTEs, you can only get part of the debt forgiven). So, companies are actually scrambling to get their RIFs done before they file for the loans and get in line for their free $$$. 

TL;DR - big layoffs coming next week. 3.3M was only the tip of the iceberg.",120,1585340293,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq4s5v/dd_rifs_layoffs_incoming_weve_only_seen_the_tip/,wallstreetbets,1

fq4dvi,plotusdotcom,Net üêªbut I don‚Äôt think massive drops can happen until companies report the effect.,"The first wave of negative moves is over. People who were margin called have either topped up with cash, sold other assets to top up, or just been closed out of their positions. The mechanical reasons for selling are over. 

There aren‚Äôt that many people that need to sell anymore. The selling is being done by speculators and speculators are being short squeezed. 

I feel like the next downward catalyst is going to have to be companies reporting earnings, corporate bond defaults, and actual bankruptcies. This could take a while to materialize because obviously companies would be doing everything in their power to avoid this and it‚Äôs only been a few weeks. 

When these events start happening we can expect mechanics to catalyze the fear to sell as well as the mechanical reasons to sell again, but I imagine this news will take weeks. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm still net bear, but be careful of your theta and expiry dates. Expiries after second quarter earnings or just short instead. 

Stop expecting it soon because the doubt and second guessing that it didn‚Äôt happen immediately after a roaring week will cause you to close out in a panic. It‚Äôs not supposed to happen yet. A watched pot never boils.

But you seem to forget that this is the stock market, so there is a trick for every single thing, and even you can do what JPow is cooking, that is converting absolute losses to maximum gains. If you have bought a SPY 4/17 230p, simply sell a SPY 4/3 230p. By doing that, you are capturing back losses whenever the market jumps. If you think after 4/3 that the market is going to absolute shit, then simply buy back the put and let your 4/17 put rides into the sunset. 

TLDR: If you want to regain your losses when the market acts stupid, sell a put at the same strike price you have with a one-week out expiration. This is a put calendar spread. 

Example: Buy a SPY 4/17 230p 

Sell a SPY 4/3 230p 

If you're sure that after 4/3 the market is going to absolutely tank, then do not purchase anymore put and just let your 4/17 put rides.

Rental companies rely on a number of revenue sources, namely:
Leisure travel- As you fucktards know most people arent just traveling willy nilly with lockdowns, quarantines and flights being canceled out the ass they are getting fucked by their one off vacation and travel renters.

Business travel- Each of the big 3 Enterprise, Avis and Hertz rely on their contracts with big companies utilizing them for professional travel to regularly provide a consistant flow of rentals. With companies canceling business travel, conferences and employing a work from home system, they are losing  these revenue's completely.

Insurance rentals- Basically you wreck your car because you were being an autist and you need a rental while your car gets repaired. With a huge reduction in travel there will be a reduction in accidents killing many of these long term revenue sources. Although part delays due to beer virus could cause longer term rentals for cars already on the road.

The big 3 have already begun massive layoffs and store closures as well as fleet reductions going forward.

Should we buy or sell the news?

\---

The real question is.. has decreased earnings for most companies over the next 6 months been priced in? 

Before you answer, consider how prices move for individual stocks after earnings calls. Even when temporary losses have been projected and the company meets their estimate, prices usually move after the news.

Stimulus measures will no doubt help, but they will take time to be effective. And a stock market crash is not the same as a recession. Crashes happen when the air is let out after a pricing bubble bursts. Recessions happen when real earnings consistently decrease on average over time.

Almost no one on this forum, or anywhere for that matter, knows how to properly value a company. There's almost no discussion about price / earnings ratios. Instead, people talk about trends.

Here's the truth, bois. Stocks are worth what people will pay for them, and that's all. They're like gold. Some people use gold for industry, some people use stocks for their voting rights, but most people have no idea how expensive it is to get gold out of the ground, or how much money it would cost to build a new business that effectively competes with a public company.

The current average price / earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is 19.47 vs a historical average of 14.82. [https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) That leaves ample room for the continued deflation of ""irrational exuberance"".. and that's without even pricing in the earnings decline from real unemployment.

You can make money by betting on the news and making savvy bets on trends. But if you want to sleep better at night.. stop buying and selling the market. Instead, buy good companies when they are cheap, and short bad companies when they are expensive.""

fq3v1q,Allteir,Let me tell you what the McFuck is going to happen the next following days,"Some retard going to come up with the most, highly-praised DD about how the market is going to go one way or another at a certain time and as a return you retards will follow it and lose all your fucking money.

But here let me do you a favor and leave you with a few facts that have been seen repeatedly over the freaking month.

\- Every time the market ends on a spike, the likelihood that the following day will be red is higher than not.

\- Every time the market ends on a decline, the likelihood that the following day will be green is higher than not. 

\- Every time the market swings hardly one way, it will bounce back the other way; stocks don't go up and down in a straight line. 

\- The closer your option is to expiration, the higher the theta. So if you are considering buying make sure it is not high so it doesn't lose its value by the time the bounce hits. 

\- The farther the option is, far OTM, the less likely you will profit or even sell the option. Far OTM is literally a lottery ticket. 

Does this mean that if the market moon at eod, the next day will be red? No, retard. It means that there's a more likelihood that it will be red; it is a possibility, not a certainty. Meaning that the vulnerability that it will fall from its high point will be more sensible than not. This is a gamble. This is a bet. This is wall street fucking bets.

LMT 220p 4/17 can be bought for .01 so why not just through like 20-30 down for contracts and worst case you lose 20-30 bucks and if you can afford that you have a lot more issues to take care of than buy anything right now but best case the market drops next week and you at least will put some gains into the portfolio to wager on more SPY phoots. 

This would not be my most autistic move but will definitely fight for one of the top spots

fq2t7k,Ostnic,Controversy of direction,"Ok so I'm just an autist that's been piecing information together like a good boi. This is my analysis of the situation and I'd love to start a conversation to see just how far up the spectrum I am.

The current environment is that the fed can print to buy assets which delays inflation and the stim checks/bailouts float the economy above a crash and current deflation works in favour. However if confidence in the dollar/fed printing is lost due to cases/deaths/job loss then maaaaaaybe the fed loses grip on confidence and their printer becomes obsolete. This is difficult to gauge as it is up to investor sentiment and it seems the fed is working hard to decouple the market from the economy with printing. Oil and world flocking to USD as reserve currency due to fear of their own doesn't help the put game either.

What factors am I missing? I know we're globally tied and my analysis is only using USA factors. What about shadowbanking, loan defaults, foreign bond purchasing, etc. What else can save my puts? Boris Johnson dying of beer flu?

I know China is opening back up just to have factories mass lay people off, also as they're opening up the rest of the world is drying up in demand due to quarantines. Their manufacturing economy is fucked. 40% of their small businesses are supposed to default by May.

There is a big difference between having strong hands and watching your portfolio burn for no reason. If you're going to watch it burn, it should be in a blaze of yolo glory, none of this slow burning weak shit.

There is one big reason you're letting it burn
**Sunk cost fallacy.**  This asshole is your brain trying to lose you money.  Your brain says that I spent a lot of money on this position and lost a lot of money so I may as well hold on to it now.  This is irrational. Stop it.  The market does not give a shit how much your position cost initially.  It's the reason you stay in crappy relationships longer than you should, aside from the obvious.

**Strong hands:** being able to weather expected variability within the market without panic trading

**Dumb hands:** ignoring new clear information that is now available to you because you want to hold a position


When you aren't sure which is which, ask yourself: Would I still buy this position today, at this current price, knowing all that I know now. 
Because effectively that's what you are doing every day you are holding a position.

* If the answer is yes, hold strong, don't doubt your vibe. 
* If the answer is no, that means you are only holding onto it because you already have it, get out of that shit.

Obviously there are a ton of other fallacies and biases costing you money, google them.  If you're going to lose money at least lose it correctly.

‚ÄúOur Global Chief Economist shares his expectations for the potential depth and length of a U.S. recession.
Transcript

Greg Davis:  There‚Äôs been a lot of concern around the R word ‚Äúrecession‚Äù. What‚Äôs your team‚Äôs thoughts in terms of the likelihood that we‚Äôre going to enter a recession and what you would be looking out for?

Joe Davis:  Well, unfortunately, Greg, you know the U.S. economy is going to enter a deep recession. You know, the nature of the efforts to contain the virus has also led to closures or suspension of a lot of business activity, particularly in the service sector. And so our estimate is that the economy will contract, on an annualized basis, perhaps as much as close to 20%, which is significant over the next several months. It would be the largest single quarterly drop in our history since at least World War II, at least since records have been kept. Consumer spending will particularly contract in leisure, hospitality, restaurants. We‚Äôre already seeing that, and it‚Äôs not going to be news.

Unfortunately, because of the nature of the shock and how quickly it has hit, many businesses have effectively a cash vacuum because revenue is dried up, and because of that, unfortunately, the unemployment rate is going to really rise rapidly in a very short period of time. The biggest, probably sharpest increase we‚Äôve ever seen. Now again, I‚Äôm not trying to scare investors. It‚Äôs just it‚Äôs going to be a profound, sharp fall.

Now the one positive is that, again, this is based upon what we anticipate in not only fiscal response but hopefully the nature of the need for containment dissipates as the virus does. That is our baseline assumption. If that occurs, then towards the end of the summer of the U.S. economy is actually growing again, which would mean that the recession, although it will be very deep, ironically, could also be the shortest in our history.

Greg:  Which would be great news.

Joe:  Which would be great news. Now we would climb out of it. It would take a little bit of time, but I think again, part of this has been, the ability of consumers and businesses to pursue economic activity rather than the willingness. And so that would dictate all else equal, the recovery should be so much stronger and certainly stronger than coming out of the fiscal crisis in 2009 and 2010.‚Äù",17,1585332935,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq296q/vanguard_expectations_for_recession_sharp_but/,wallstreetbets,8

fq231l,expander2,"WSB DD Summary 3/26-3/27, Plays and TLDR included","Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 3/26-3/27. I‚Äôm your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&amp;#x200B;

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

&amp;#x200B;

As is tradition, I shall start with the news. [Boris Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpv7i4/boris_johnson_tests_positive_for_covid19/) (The UK's Trump) has tested positive for WuFlu. That=we are fuk. There is news [that GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/) and Ford will not be building ventilators for the hospitals as DJ Trump said. They did not realize the logistics and that transmissions and ventilators are not the same thing. For those of us that cant extrapolates, this means fewer ventilators for victims of China's Plague of Doom.

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Government and JPow are spending a shit load on trying to keep the SS Economy from taking a nose dive to the Marianas Trench. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/) explains the numbers and there are even pictures for you to look at. The Fed is throwing lots and lots of money at this problem to make the ship sink a little slower. Well, they can't do that forever and today is clearly an example of that. Money only makes people happy for so long, especially when their family is dying.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know we hate every other investing subreddit, however, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/) is a good (serious) view of what the coming months will look like and relates what is coming to 2008. We are ticking all the boxes of similarities and that is not a good thing. Not saying its gonna be as bad as The Great Recession but lookout.  

&amp;#x200B;

Next is another bit of knowledge for you fucks. My boy u/fuzzyblankeet did one of the [best breakdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) I have ever seen using SeaWorld (SEAS) as an example. He explains how to break down any companies 10-K (which is an annual report about the financials, company makeup, etc.). He shows us retards how to do a targeted review, breakdown and understand their debt, and goes over financial covenants. These are all big words but if you read the post then it'll be a lot easier to understand. Reading this post will allow you to do YOUR OWN DD instead of relying on WSB and fucking idiots like me.

&amp;#x200B;

On to the actual plays. Mariott (MAR) looks like it's gonna have some problems because of the Beer Flu. No one is traveling right now so no one is booking hotel rooms. No bookings= no revenue. Expect a drop in earnings, and because of this, a drop in stock price. MAR 5/15 50p is what [the OP said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpiimx/big_dd_marriott_is_dead/) but I would go for a higher strike because people will want to sell at the price of the stock now ($80) if it drops to $50 a share.  

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, oil is going to be something to watch in the coming weeks. If America and our economy goes tits up, oil goes tits up according to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/).  The US economy grinding to a standstill will compound with the Saudis dropping the price per barrel and ramping up production. His post gives us a few ways to profit from the fall of oil including ETFs, options, and stocks. Puts on any oil company that can not support itself through this and make sure they expire late April/May. Note, DO NOT play with DWT or UWT. They are being delisted on April 3rd. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Warning; satire!) Now I'm gonna do a little fear-mongering. So the book of Revelations tells humans how the world will end. The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse will come (Famine, Death, War, Pestilence), trumpets will sound, and the end will be nigh. We already have death and pestilence (which means plague) because of COVID19. Famine is coming with the [GIANT SWARM OF LOCUSTS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-a-plague-of-locusts-is-threatening-crops-in-africa-and-beyond/ar-BB11JOHX?li=BBnb7Kz) 3 times the size of New York in Africa and the middle east. And with China and the US having a [dick measuring contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsulz/trade_war_part_2/) in the Taiwan Strait we are looking at the possibility of war. Also, are we sure that God said trumpets and not Trump/Pence? Just kidding, this is all bullshit, I don't believe in God. If he's real then he's a dick.  Strike me down where I stand.

&amp;#x200B;

Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this man](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpm6qt/ive_been_told_to_come_here_to_make_it_all_back/). Why would you come to WSB to make your money back? What a fucking idiot. I thought that everyone knew we only lost money here. You lose $260,000 and come to the hive mind of autism for help? Fuck off.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Boris Johnson is fuk, GM and Ford are not medical manufacturers, Feds can only fuck the market for so long, Mariott is fucked possibly, Oil is fucked possibly, and the Book of Revelations is happening.

Plays; MAR 5/15 50p (Eh, probably a higher strike), any Oil company that can't support themselves (Except DWT and UWT)

fq1d9r,scumborg,Can unlimited QE really prevent a crash?,"I know everybody loves the brrrrr meme right now (it's literally never not hilarious--keep it up, guys) but I feel like most people don't really know what QE is or how it factors into the market.

That includes me. I've watched the first 30 seconds of a bunch of YouTube videos on QE so I know it has to do with lending, bonds, and liquidity, but that's about it.

From what I can gather, QE is going to soften the fall but it's not going to fix the underlying issues the market is facing. I see a lot of people saying QE is propping up the market, but isn't it really just smoothing out the crash? It seems like there's always a ""sugar high"" after a QE announcement, followed by continued declines in the market.

One thing I'm pretty sure of is that it isn't just handing corporations giant bags of free money. We're talking about loans, right? Corporations have to pay all this money back at some point, don't they? It's not like Jpow is just walking up to a McDonald's every morning and ordering 10 million McGriddles to keep their lights on.

fq1c58,Trolololer,Current state of the NY tri-state area,"As someone who is from the Connecticut-New York Area, I can tell you that the situation is a lot worse than the media or certainly the tweeter-in-chief wants you to believe. 

Right now there is an absolute lack of testing and sufficient medical supplies and equipment. People here can't get anything, to get the option to get a test could take days,  you'll get the test day scheduled like 3-7 days after you call, and then it takes another week and change for the results to come in, making for over two weeks of waiting time from the moment you decide you want a test to the day you actually get results. Further than that no one can see a doctor for any reason, many doctors are even doing appointments over FaceTime. The lack of government recognition for the seriousness and medical severity of this situation is making for facilities, businesses and communities even more unprepared for this problem than they already were.

I live in an area about 30 minutes from NYC that is essentially in the middle of the epicenter, so I know the cases around here may be more extreme, but I'm pretty sure all of the surrounding communities in the north east area are starting to experience similar conditions if they haven't already.

Long but informative video on the science of Covid-19. Skip to 25 mins if you don't care about the scientific part of it and want to hear numbers from the perspective of a surgeon. 

Tldr for those who don't want to watch: 
Covid-19 spreads via droplets (coughs and sneezes) and lives on surfaces which ultimately causes pneumonia and respiatory issues. Requires people to use ventilators which is limited in supply. Current American death rate is 1.3%. Italy is 10%. Expects Covid to increase exponentially (up to millions), maybe peak in daily cases mid May, and have an exponential increase in death rate by July. Expects India to go to shit bc slums. Doesn't expect vaccines for 12-18 months. Due to unemployment and quarantine, no one has money to pay for funerals.

Look, everyone and their mom has had the idea that these companies will go up during this crisis. The rises in these companies are an obvious bubble. Just take a look at the three-month charts for any of these tickers. Where does their profit come from? What do they do uniquely that gives them an edge over other similar companies? Once the crisis is over (say, 3-6 months from now), these companies will be no better than they were before the crisis. Slack and Zoom especially don't have any alternative product.

 For instance, morningstar gives Zoom a fair value of $62, Slack $20, Netflix $150. These estimates aren't everything, but fundamentally none of these companies have done anything to increase their true value during the crisis.

Similarly, I've seen a lot of risky plays on companies that will obviously have value after coronavirus is over. Uber, Lyft, Ford all have deep enough pockets to wait out coronavirus, and once things are back to normal, they'll be just as valuable. This is why they skyrocketed a few days ago, and why Puts on them won't be as profitable. This being said, I think there's still room to drop and am personally betting on a ""bottom"" in mid-May, based on my virus model. If a recession follows, there will be a long bleed afterwards, but I admit there's potential for a quick recovery, and would maybe even bet more heavily on this side, unless you believe strongly in the underlying problems with repos/loans or whatever.

fq0rig,uncertain_future_30,"A reminder: you don't know shit about what's going to happen, and neither do I","Hi.  I'm new here.  But I've come to remind you of something that deep inside you knew already but that you might have forgotten in your rush to buy puts with every last penny because, hell, even Kermit the Frog seemed convinced.

You don't know what the end game here is with this virus, and neither do I.  Virtually no one does. Out of all the people in the world, some might know a little bit more than others do, but guess what?  *You're not fucking one of them.*  You know why?  Because if you were, you wouldn't be spending your Friday reading an Internet post by some random fucktard on an Internet forum subscribed to by 1 million people whose favorite phrases are ""YOLO"" and ""printer go brrrrr"" and who upvote people making (or at least claiming to make; you don't really know, do you?) [extremely brainless decisions](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpo4y5/brothers_the_time_has_come_for_the_ultimate_yolo/) -- a forum whose front page, is, *according to its own standards*, almost entirely [full of shit](https://imgur.com/vlbl1hT).

I don't know what you would be doing, exactly, but it would be a lot more productive than being on this forum.  You would be the kind of person who, if they were subscribed to a subreddit, would subscribe to one involving something like [studying](https://reddit.com/r/LSAT/) for a [test](https://reddit.com/r/GRE/) that is actually challenging or [asking someone](https://reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/) who knows [more than you](https://reddit.com/r/askscience/) something more complex than ""drrr, but what ticker do I buy puts on tho?""  Actually, you would be the one helping people study, and the one providing in-depth answers on subjects that you do actually know about, and you would not have to be told to *shut the fuck up* on topics that you don't know about, because you have enough of a brain to know that, no matter who you are, the list of things you don't know is *infinitely fucking longer* than the things you do know.  And guess what?  This is especially true for things like this virus (which naturally you refer to as the ""beer virus"" because everything is a joke to you) because *there is no good historical analogy to the current situation we are in*.  

""But the experts!  I listened to them!"" you say.  Well, first of all, I imagine that some of you did, but most of you just repeated the thing that you heard or read somewhere else, because apparently your sole purpose in life is to act as a vector for shitty memes and deadly viruses.  But anyway, even if you did do your best to find an in-depth analysis on possible scenarios, maybe even [one with actual math](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), guess what? I can find an [argument pointing out its crucial flaws](https://necsi.edu/review-of-ferguson-et-al-impact-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions).  I might even be able to find [a contrary analysis by the same fucking author](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Global-Impact-26-03-2020.pdf) written 10 days later.  Okay, fine, that shit was from the Brits, fuck them and their tea, let's try to find a more reliable resource, maybe by a dude who likes baseball and poker, because those are related to epidemiology and the economy, right?  His site contacted a bunch of unnamed experts and asked them what they thought, and guess what?  [They don't know either](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/experts-say-the-coronavirus-outlook-has-worsened-but-the-trajectory-is-still-unclear/).  To be specific, [this graphic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/boice.EXPERT-SURVEY.0325-5fix.png?w=575) has the title ""Still a lot of uncertainty around coronavirus' death toll.""  In case that title and the linked graphic are both too hard for you to understand, it means some of their ""experts"" said ""WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE.  POSSIBLY MILLIONS.""  But then again, a smaller number of their ""experts"" had estimates with an upper range below 200,000.  Translation:  *Those* people said, ""WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL DIE, BUT MILLIONS?  NO WAY!!""

""But there's no way some of these companies will survive!  I even read their 10-K like my Daddy told me to, and they have negative cashflow, and are overleveraged!!"" you say.  First of all, good for you for [listening to your daddy](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/).  You should [do that](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/).  I am just your crazy fucking uncle who knows jack-all about anything but is self-aware enough to know it and to recognize it in other people.  So don't listen to me if you don't want.

But hear this: Do you know when people will be allowed to go back to work again?  To travel again?  Do you know when they actually will decide to do that?  How, prithee, doth thee knoweth, O gayest of the Gay Knights in all the Rainbow Kingdom?  Have you considered how much of an impact all this [totalitarian-style social distancing](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/) or [lack thereof](https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/coronavirus-in-nyc-subway-cut-backs-leads-to-packed-commute/) will have, and how much impact our lack of ability to protect the people who are taking care of the sick will have?  Have you compared the different measures that different states are taking and compared their effectiveness? Have you considered the fact that we have a wildly unpredictable, impetuous, reality TV star for a president? Have you thought about the fact that we could have a second wave, or we could not, or the virus could mutate and become less deadly, or it could not, or anti-viral drugs could be effective, but most likely not, or the fact that the American people are, on the one hand, very resourceful and willing to pull together in times of crisis, while on the other hand, they [suck at math](https://qz.com/638845/americans-are-spectacularly-bad-at-answering-even-the-most-basic-math-questions/) and they suck especially hard at statistics because [they aren't even taught that shit in high school](https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/05/23/calculus-is-the-peak-of-high-school.html?intc=main-mpsmvs), even though it kind of seems important in times like these? If you have thought about all those things and all the other relevant variables which somehow you were able to exhaustively enumerate, and you have been able to predict exactly when, *or even approximately when*, economic activity will pick back up again, along with how and when institutional investors will respond, so you can ride your very own gay bear train to the land of milk and rainbow-colored honey, then congratulations, and this post doesn't apply to you.  But let's be honest: it almost certainly fucking does. So have fun making bets, don't piss away your life savings because you got caught up in the hype, and for the sake of my immunocompromised wife with an anxiety disorder, keep *washing your damn hands like you fucking mean it*.",69,1585328600,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq0rig/a_reminder_you_dont_know_shit_about_whats_going/,wallstreetbets,6

Data from Pew Research Center shows large swaths of the U.S. are trying to cope without a household internet connection while much of the country hunkers down to work and shop from home.

Before coronavirus hit the U.S., about 7% of private-industry workers had access to a flexible workplace benefit, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those jobs tend to pay well, which helps explain why access to telework varies sharply by income, according to the Pew Research Center.

Lack of internet access has also left millions of households cut off from vital services and information during the pandemic. ‚ÄîMelodie Warner, John Schoen",10,1585327424,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq0cxr/who_out_robin_hood_in_charge_of_the_internet/,wallstreetbets,8

Picture this:
july 1st, due to complete mismanagement at every level of the government, bat flu has continued to circulate throughout the united states. the situation initially improved in cities like LA and NYC after social distancing measures but a massive second wave hit southern states that were initially deemed lower risk and never locked down. the lack of interstate travel restrictions led to continued flight of infected persons in these cities back to the major population centers in the northeast and west coast. 

despite the initial 2T stimulus and a second 2T stimulus, unemployment has grown to over 30 million as greedy corporations decide to furlough their most vulberable workers in order to preserve precious capital. 

stuck in their homes for over 3 months, many of these lower wage workers have their backs to the wall, and with plenty of time for introspection, finally see this country for what it is ‚Äî a giant pyramid scheme that only benefits the rich. massive uprisings swell in the nations biggest cities, reviving the anger that fueled occupy wallstreet.

fq00g3,scopolamine,Event 201: A global pandemic exercise,"In October, 2019 the Gates Foundation teamed up with the World Economic Forum and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security to enact what they called a ‚Äúfictional‚Äù scenario simulation involving some of the world‚Äôs leading figures in public health. It was titled Event 201. Here's the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174)

As their website describes it, Event 201 simulated an ‚Äúoutbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.‚Äù

In the Event 201 scenario the disease originates at a pig farm in Brazil, spreading through low-income regions and ultimately explodes into an epidemic. The disease is carried by air travel to Portugal, the USA and China and beyond to the point no country can control it. The scenario posits no possible vaccine being available in the first year. ‚ÄúSince the whole human population is susceptible, during the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases increases exponentially, doubling every week.‚Äù

The scenario then ends after 18 months when the fictional coronavirus has caused 65 million deaths. ‚ÄúThe pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed.‚Äù",30,1585326415,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fq00g3/event_201_a_global_pandemic_exercise/,wallstreetbets,27

fpzy5h,stanthemank,Be prepared for market closure!,"New York has become the epicenter of Covid-19 outbreak in the U.S. and at some point, there will be a full lockdown IMO, almost Wuhan-style. People think this will never happen in the U.S. but there is a reason the National Guard and certain elements from DoD have already moved and stationed around NYC. If the situation continues to get worse, Cuomo will order a complete lockdown. 

New York City is the world financial capital and home to NYSE, NASDAQ, the NY Fed, and most major wealth and hedge funds. I know I know, the machines run everything, but the machines need human oversight, IT support to ensure proper operation and maintenance, not to mention the hundreds of behind-the-scene jobs that various trading and financial operations depend on.

No one wants to close markets, there will be a ton of pressure from Mnuchin and the administration to keep things open and operating normally, but at some point, probably by week of April 6th it will become apparent that a total shutdown is warranted. Even those who want things to remain open will beg the Governor and the President to order a lockdown.

Not trying to spread fear or misinformation, but if you have positions that expire in the next few weeks, consider how that possibility may impact your investments and plan accordingly.

fpz2nn,SAnderson1986,Volatility is high - there will be 12% swings,"#  What is Volatility?

Volatility is a statistical measure of the [dispersion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dispersion.asp) of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured as either the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) or [variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) between returns from that same security or market index.

In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and¬†falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a ""volatile"" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

#  What is the Empirical Rule?

The empirical rule, also referred to as the [three-sigma rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/three-sigma-limits.asp) or 68-95-99.7 rule, is a statistical rule which states that for a normal distribution, almost all data falls within three standard deviations (denoted by œÉ) of the mean (denoted by ¬µ). Broken down, the empirical rule shows that 68% falls within the first standard deviation (¬µ ¬± œÉ), 95% within the first two standard deviations (¬µ ¬± 2œÉ), and 99.7% within the first three standard deviations (¬µ ¬± 3œÉ).

# Current market

Take the VIX which is around 65. The daily standard deviation move will be (65/sqrt(252))=4.1%. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three standard deviations would mean around +-12% swings! And this is what we observed in the last couple of days. Unlikely, yet possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

# What should you do?

Decide for yourself in which direction the market is heading and bet as much as you are comfortable with holding, even if you lose a big chunk of it. Volatility gives and takes. Changing your overall sentiment with every swing will stress you and make you lose these hard-earned tendies.

* Tilray (TLRY) +130%
* Canapy Growth (CGC) +24%
* Aurora Cannabis (ACB) +25%

The short story is that I think a lot of these just rode the wave up with the rest of the market and it's only a matter of weeks before they lose these gains and return to their regularly scheduled descents into the depths of hell.

I'm especially targeting TLRY which was down 66% by October, 2019 before all of the shenanigans started. 

* [Why is Tilray Trading Higher?](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/20/03/15676304/why-tilrays-stock-is-trading-higher-today) (Answer = no reason)

   * No trade shows (Covid)
   * No tourist sales (Covid)
   * Loss of sales from shelter-in-place orders (Covid)
   * NO HANDOUT IN THE STIMULUS BILL (Covid)

The last issue is obviously the biggest issue at the moment. Everyone is suffering and industries that get no relief will have a hard time getting through this. Combine this with the fact that the cannabusiness was getting ass-smacked before this and you have a recipe for extinction.

Well obviously over the past month I was worried that I was going to get absolutely fucked by this quarantine.

I need not have worried. My house has been on the market for two days and I have already had five showings. Realtors are skirting the shelter in place (they are not ""essential"") by setting up appointments and having sellers do the showing themselves. I just had to sign some bullshit waiver.

Chances are other industries are doing shit like this as well (I work in construction and we are still business as usual) which means our total cases will continue to grow exponentially and will not plateau any time soon like they did in China, Italy, etc.

**TLDR: Coronavirus cases will continue to grow exponentially (\~1 million cases by second week of April), buy puts.**",42,1585320437,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpy5j3/quarantineshelter_in_place_dd/,wallstreetbets,1

JPow sat down at his desk and let out a long sigh as he looked at his MacBook. It had a big 'dollar-sign' sticker on the top that he got for 50 cents at the bowling alley. He opened the computer and used his pointer fingers to type in his password: ""J-Money#1"". 

He took a long sip of the warm milk in his coffee mug. ""How much more should we print?!?"" He yelled at the intern situated at a desk outside of his office.

""I don't know man, it's unlimited, just make up a number"" the intern shouts back. JPow hated the intern's dismissive tone but the young man was 6'5'' and built like a NFL linebacker... his wife called the intern a ""Chad"", but JPow didn't know what that meant. He mumbled to himself, ""I'm the money man. Nobody else.""

JPow opened up the Google sheets doc titled ""$$$ Money for government $$$"" and looked at the only cell on the sheet with anything in it. ""100 trillion"" it read.

He stopped for a moment, smiling at his own brilliance, then deleted the word ""trillion"" and replaced it with ""gazillion"". JPow nodded and took another sip of the milk, satisfied with his work for the day.

Insurance, personal auto insurance specifically, is gonna do extremely well these next few quarters with a decrease in miles driven due to stay at home measures . Miles driven is the truest predictor of losses and I have a feeling insurers will be extremely profitable because most will keep paying their premium.

Things you‚Äôll want to consider in your own analysis:
Primarily auto insurer, particularly personal auto. Concentrated in states affected greatly by the stay at home measures.

Potential downsides:
Decrease in revenue if people cancel their policies.

fpwt30,curiousofa,GM Building Mass Ventilators = Fake News = People Can't Breathe,"On Sunday, Trump tweeted out that auto execs were teaming up to build much needed ventilators. It appears, the auto execs never got the full logistics of the buildout and who was paying.

GM initially said that they could turn their car factory and use auto transmissions to quickly build 20,000 ventilators. Turns out that was false, and they realized that auto transmissions do not have much in common with ventilators and they maybe will be able to get 5000 out.

The administration is back at square one and talking with other manufacturers to get realistic pricing and ventilator numbers. Even if they are able to find a manufacturer in the next week, do we expect them to turn out 20,000+(still a low number) ventilators within a month or sooner? If so, what will the infection and severe cases look like by then? If not, what will deaths look like?

I wonder if Donny's optimistic tweets and outlook helps the market pump? If it does, reality should hit and we realize that Uncle Donny was only speaking in hyperbole and market should correct for that?

However to me it‚Äôs obvious... NY is closing in in peak apocalypse... and people are getting infected so every time a new small infection groups starts... you can restart that 15 days and the shit show keeps on going...

fpwjj1,Mortorz,DD - Covid news from Italy,"Hello folks, quick and brief report from spaghettiland.  

Do you know all this fuzz about Covid? It is actually way worse than expected, because numbers aren't right.  

So what's up? Simple! There's loads of people showing syntomps that doesn't get tested. They get told to stay home in quarantine, and that's it! Actual numbers for infected people are higher than what's reported officially. I cannot quantify the magnitude of this, but I'd say that the issue lies in testing capabilities that can't keep up with the number of potential cases. How do I know this? Well, I live in one of the hardest hit cities (Parma) and I got more than one report of this procedure from different sources.  

On top of this, a recent article has shown that death numbers don't fit: in this little study performed by 2 physicians, the number of Total Flu Deaths vs Covid Deaths vs Expected ""Normal Flu"" Deaths is plotted.  

Result? There's a spike in total deaths corresponding to beer flu arrival, but the numbers are skewed if compared to expected ""normal flu"" deaths: there's 5 times the expected deaths, but only 30% of these are reported as Covid deaths, what about the rest? This means there's a lot of deaths that are not classified as Covid cases, but actually are Covid cases. And that's understandable: there's not enough tests for everyone, so you go back home and die. No test = not a Covid case. Ez  

TL;DR beer flu numbers are skewed. Actual numbers are higher than reported (for Italy at least), while death % is probably lower than reported (it would get lower with more tests available, see Diamond Princess reports that estimate death % at 1-2 max).

fpw0pq,originalmuggins,Fed Balance Sheet question,"So the Fed released its balance sheet and, no surprise, this week saw a record increase in the Fed deficit. It‚Äôs no secret the Fed has been buying all kinds of things (corporate debt, bonds, even equities apparently). This is at least part of the reason we have had a positive week. 

My question is: how does the Fed reduce its deficit eventually? If it is purchasing securities, it eventually has to sell them, right? And if so, I would guess it would wait for an environment where selling wouldn‚Äôt cause a massive market disruption. Meaning when there is less volatility. 

How would this affect the eventual recovery? Would it put a cap on the recovery, potentially lower than we were before? Will it mean some increased volatility even when things ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù in the real world? Or will they just print money to reduce the deficit and risk inflation?

Thoughts from someone smarter than me are much appreciated.",16,1585311797,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpw0pq/fed_balance_sheet_question/,wallstreetbets,1

fpu6um,mfairview,VFF earnings thread q4 and 2019 annual,"They ran late this time due to switching from ifrs to gaap. They had to go back and restate all er from last year. Going forward, it should be much easier

ER will be released on Monday AH and cc on Tuesday @8:30a

VFF has a jv for weed in cad and jv for hemp in the states. They were traditionally a veggie grower for 30yr prior to getting into weed in 2017. As a result, they have been selling veggies to all the big box stores (walmart, wholefoods, trader joes, kroger, etc) for years and the expectation is that they will be able to sell cbd products there as well. 

Q4 is the first full quarter that they've been selling weed online (ontario). Prior to that, they were mostly wholesale while waiting on their license from healthcare Canada. 

They have a handful of products but 2/5 top selling strains on ocs belong to them with the #1 strain (by dollar and volume) being their Kush brand. They recently announced that number rose to 2/4 for the last 2mo and that they now have a 13% market share on ocs. 

They are the lowest indoor producer at .49/g (expecting a little higher in q4 due to seasonal cost: lighting, heat, etc)

They should also have hemp sales after harvesting about 1m lbs in 2019 in the states

Est: .01 for q4

I'm expecting closer to .08

2020 will be a game changer for them with them doubling their grow facility and their cbd strategy coming online. We know covid has increased sales in weed across the board and there are now rumors that it will expedite legalization in the US as states look for other sources of revenues.

fpu10t,sad23dd2qd3,Shorting tobacco and vaping stocks,"So in light of the coronavirus, there are three main factors that should be considered:

\- smoking likely puts you at greater risk of death or serious infection

\- the smoke/vapor one is exhaling is likely to spread the virus

\- governments may ban smoking entirely or limit it further to one's own private home. I admit this is unlikely but i do see a possibility of governments across the world running massive campaigns against smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

We're in a very early stage of covid stuff but more data is coming every day about the patients and sooner or later we will know how bad smoking is... or not.

fptwcf,Inspiration2345,FTSE down 3% - todays plays,"At the time of writing this 9am GMT - the FTSE 100 is down 3% and UK markets are blood red.

S&amp;P futures are also down 2% but be careful everyone. We've seen back to back green days lately but just be wary of how the market might be faked pumped, like the classic low volume we saw this Thursday.

I hope this will be a bloody red day, but we saw how quickly the fed can keep printing and switch things around like we saw on thursday morning.

TL,DR; Hold off on any positions during the early morning volume. And if you are still brave/retarded enough to place puts. Only place a fraction that you was planning to. Wait until 1-2pm ET (5/6pm GMT) time to put in the remaining puts depending on how things go.

TL,DR of the TL,DR; If you're gonna play half puts morning, half in evening/close.

Word of warning, Thursday night we saw the printing machine go brrrr on insane mode within the last 15mins before close. We all know they want today to close green.

I fell asleep and went immediately into sleep paralysis. Then a figure appeared by my bed side. They were translucent and kept calling my name and calling out a ticker called QADA. Told me to buy calls for April. Ironically dude sounded like Sasuke from Naruto. I immediately woke up and wrote it down on my notepad at 2 in the morning. Went back to sleep and opened the trade with $1000. 

Held it, today it went up to $11k but I couldn‚Äôt sell it due to absolutely no volume or buyers. 

I managed to sell it for half and take a $5000 profit to save my account from the SPY puts anal carnage.

fpst66,neutral_hotel,The uncertainty that still exists: US deaths in the coming weeks,"Two days ago I made a post saying how the US would have the most cases recorded:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fod8m0/us\_on\_track\_to\_becoming\_1\_for\_covid19\_casesdeaths/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fod8m0/us_on_track_to_becoming_1_for_covid19_casesdeaths/)

I would have assumed this would have been reached over the weekend but cases spiked much higher after testing has ramped up. Now here is a point that I made in that article that most people overlooked: **the top two countries with the most recorded deaths are also considered the healthiest countries (according to Bloomberg's 2019 HCI)**

![img](6ijbybq1v5p41)

You know where the United States sits? Number 35 with a grade of 73.02%

Dr. Fauci mentioned in a [video interview with Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A3jiM2FNR8) that the people he is most worried about are the people with ""underlying conditions such as **heart disease, lung disease, and** **diabetes**"". America is fucking hub of all of these, how do you think we will fare against the virus when the healthiest countries are hurting.

**TLDR #1: Deaths are going to hit harder and faster in America compared to Italy and Spain, so buckle up.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now the point about the three day rally. You retards should have listened to u/separation-variation when he called that SPY would have a huge spike up (it's okay I only bought calls for a day then bought more puts and am down 40%). Imagine what it's like being Trump/ The Fed/ bull being beat down the past few weeks. Obviously they'll do everything in their power to pump the economy, or else they're not doing their job. They're fighting against the inevitable drop but they're doing a damn good job at it.

Let's get into the psychology of this:

\- Trump: Says he wants business to return to normal by Easter, but also said it's going to be tough for a few months (he expects July). Trump is a businessman whose intention for becoming president was to boost the economy. He is short sighted and will say anything to pump up the market. If saying business is resumed and recession is cancelled, then look forward to the market drop (if there is one idk) when he has no other option to extend business closures while the US is ranked #1 for most cases/deaths.

\- J Powell: Why the fuck would he need to show up on the Today show other than to calm people and explain the recent Fed pump. You know who makes a rare appearance on public television and says ""we have unlimited ammo""? PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED AMMO. Yes J Powell is smart and I believe he's going to do his very best to delay a major crash until the curve goes down. However, if you watched the interview, his sentiment is that he himself does not know when this is going to settle and that he will ""try his best"" when the market rebounds.

**TLDR #2: Trump and Fed are also preparing for the massive drops ahead, but they'll be smart to maintain its stability in the weeks to come**

&amp;#x200B;

**Position: SPY $225 05/01**

**Current positions:**  
**- Lyft $17.5 4/17 (dear god please save these)**

fpsr8m,-Tommy_Salami-,Teva Pharmaceuticals calls,"First DD post.

I'll post a bullish (my position) and bearish case to be fair.

Teva has recently donated 6-10 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine sulfate depending on which source you go with. It has recently been widely considered an effective treatment of CV. Most recently the state of NY has been making plans to conduct trials with the combination of  hydroxychloroquine and Zithromax and chloroquine. Teva is a manufacturer of the drug as well as several others.

 [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/clinical-trials-begin-week-york-coronavirus-treatments-health/story?id=69817703](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/clinical-trials-begin-week-york-coronavirus-treatments-health/story?id=69817703) 

General public: Cool... they said CV so I'm in 100%

This isn't a CV play although,  you could swing play that sentiment. The REAL reason that this is a long term call is this -

ProAir is on backorder for the foreseeable future. It has been used a first line defense for breathing treatments. This has increased exponentially during the CV-19 crisis. Teva makes this.

 [https://community.aafa.org/blog/albuterol-inhaler-shortage-due-to-covid-19-could-impact-people-with-asthma](https://community.aafa.org/blog/albuterol-inhaler-shortage-due-to-covid-19-could-impact-people-with-asthma) 

MS patients prescriptions are being reevaluated, and prescribed back to Copaxone. Why? Their current therapies have  immunosuppressant qualities. Docs don't want their patients on those types of drugs during this pandemic. Who makes Copaxone? Teva. Currently, Copaxone is the safest drug on the market given the situation.

 [https://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/update-coronavirus-covid-19-and-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.mstrust.org.uk/news/update-coronavirus-covid-19-and-multiple-sclerosis) 

&amp;#x200B;

Teva also produces a generic EpiPen.. which was in shortage before COVID-19. So much so that the FDA has allowed for the expiration of EpiPens to go beyond the label. This will continue to be the case as people are hoarding. I could cite many sources talking about medication hoarding.. but the EpiPen is a biggun. 

 [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp\_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Epinephrine%20Injection,%200.1%20mg/mL&amp;st=c&amp;tab=tabs-1](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/dsp_ActiveIngredientDetails.cfm?AI=Epinephrine%20Injection,%200.1%20mg/mL&amp;st=c&amp;tab=tabs-1) 

Further.. with a check of what Teva is bringing in, I can see that albuterol or ProAir has increased significantly. I'm also seeing a dramatic increase in anti-inflammatory drugs... Which backs up my theory that CV is taking a stranglehold on us... but has also created a demand from Teva.

Why is Teva different from other manufacturers? They create their own APIs... while China and India have shut down exports or their drugs.. Teva is in the best position they have ever been in. 

 [https://www.tevapharm.com/product-focus/teva-api/](https://www.tevapharm.com/product-focus/teva-api/) 

Most recently Teva has donated 10-16 mil of  hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. (depending on your source) Why does that matter and why does it help/hurt Teva? The impending opiod settlement.

&amp;#x200B;

Bear theory - 

&amp;#x200B;

Self admittedly, I'm long. The pending opiod settlement is the dark cloud over Teva's head. That being said.. The court that will hear that case is in NY.. where Teva has just donated millions of tablets. They're proactively providing tablets as a PR imo. I legitimately see this lawsuit gradually becoming less of a thing and less of a settlement. However.. If I'm wrong.. Teva still provided life saving drugs during a pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR buy teva calls

Couple things out of the way: inb4 Robinhood is garbage, [included screenshots of my current positions plus my trades](https://imgur.com/a/nYXiCYx), also $BYND 40p 5/15. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started as a buy and hold retard, but realized I was going to be a wage cuck for the rest of my life. They brainwashed us in school to think of options as only hedge instruments, but then I started lurking here and saw there were serious tendies to be made.

&amp;#x200B;

I liquidated my portfolio in December (about $3K at the time) and then deposited another \~2K to get started. I made small tendies on Becky FDs, and felt ready for my first YOLO. I decided on Amazon Q4 earnings, which Papa Bezos ended up coming in clutch to boost me into five figs (15K).

&amp;#x200B;

I then FOMO'd into SPY and Tesla calls at possibly the worst time right before the beer flu hit (Feb 18th) and watched those two blow up my account back down to where I started. Out of desperation I deposited another $2k and YOLO'd that plus the cash I had left in my account on  Beyond Meat FDs for their Q4 earnings. They ended up getting beyond fucked and I was back up to 16K. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then beer flu hit and I just followed everyone's advice and loaded up on SPY puts like. After the first Monday circuit breaker gang bang I rolled these puts into 3 more rounds of SPY puts. I got fucked by the mouse along the way, and also managed to get more soy vegan tendies served up from BYND again.

fps6q5,RUatrollorRUserious,Core Inflation Numbers Tomorrow,"You know the saying ""Don't fight the fed"".  I see a lot of posts from people trying to do just that.  But I also bought IWM at the beginning of the week, and doubled down on Tuesday.  Why?  Because, we were due a relief rally, and it was confirmed when the market completely ignored the 2.5 million jobless claims on Thursday.  That should give you some pause if you're holding short dated puts, or thinking about buying more.  Though, I admit, I bought 1 SPY put at 255 at the end of the day today, because I also believe this is insane.

But, back to it.  As long as people/investors believe that the Fed will make sure everything's going to be all right, nothing will dissuade them from that.  Unless the Fed starts being proved wrong.  The one thing  J Pow said that made me sit up is that this injection won't cause inflation to rise.

Of course, there is the core inflation report, coming out tomorrow before open, though I don't think it will show any great increase.  Too afraid of being labeled a price gouger, and oil/gas prices are dropping.  According to this [study](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1995/spring/pdf/webb.pdf), there are some leading indicators that may indicate a rise in inflation.  If we can determine that inflation is actually rising, before the rest of THEM, we would know when to double down on our existing sad sack puts, rather than just waiting for the first big red candle.

So, the study has a list of 30+ of them.  Fine for academia, but we're looking to print before anyone else.  I narrowed it down.  

Labor: Unemployment, Weekly hours, Employed to population ratio (Check)

Money Supply: (Check!)

Commodity Prices:  Futures of Gold/Silver/Zinc/IDK?  Not sure how to measure this, since gold/silver/oil have been moving in the same general direction.  Other suggestions?  Is there a total commodities index?  (never mind, I'll google that later).

Others:  [Suppliers](https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/data/xg-tables/ro2xgppihistind.htm) \- Industrial commodities.  This is another governmental report.  Any purchasers out there willing to share their thoughts on the prices they're seeing within their industry?  

Any other things that J Pow said that were seemingly promised that we can track to possibly get a step ahead of the market, and not just hope and pray our puts will print?

fps5st,ac3k,Probable Coronavirus Rebound,"I see a lot of people assuming that this will last for a maximum of 2-3 months, and then the market will rebound, or something along those lines. I think there's great reason to believe that we'll be in this for the long run, possibly up to a year. 

Below is a graph of deaths chronologically through the time of the Spanish Flu.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Spanish Flu's thee pandemic waves](https://i.redd.it/txhoie2ao5p41.gif)

Although Coronavirus and the Spanish Flu are different diseases, they exhibit a lot of the same characteristics, the rate/method/conditions of infection being the most relevant. Both diseases are air transmittable, exhibiting a R-0 of between 2 and 3 (exponential rate of growth). I think the biggest factor that we should think about when making long term plays though is the effect of climate on viral transmission. Humidity is believed more and more to be one of the largest contributing factors of viral transmission.  \[Studies\]( [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333087331\_Low\_ambient\_humidity\_impairs\_barrier\_function\_and\_innate\_resistance\_against\_influenza\_infection](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333087331_Low_ambient_humidity_impairs_barrier_function_and_innate_resistance_against_influenza_infection) ) have linked high humidity to a large decrease in infection rates, and conversely, low humidity to a large increase. This is probably pretty obvious, everyone knows that there's a flu season, but the interesting part is that this (almost certainly) effects all respiratory viruses like Coronavirus. 

&gt; inhalation of dry air impairs mucociliary clearance, innate antiviral defense, and tissue repair. Moreover, disease exacerbated by low relative humidity was ameliorated in caspase-1/11‚Äìdeficient Mx1 mice, independent of viral burden. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that induction of IFN-stimulated genes in response to viral infection was diminished in multiple cell types in the lung of mice housed in low humidity condition. These results indicate that exposure to dry air impairs host defense against influenza infection, reduces tissue repair, and inflicts caspase-dependent disease pathology. 

Skimming through the details here, the part I think is important is the fact that low humidity air diminishes the mucus layer. The mucus layer is one of the main defenses against respiratory illnesses, which are typically transmitted through the nose, mouth, and eyes. This is especially true with Coronavirus- I'm too lazy to find the papers but it has been confirmed multiple times that throughout the initial contagious period, a massive amount of virus clumps up in the throat, leading to the frequent airborne transmission we've all heard enough about. 

If all of that is legit, this means we're probably looking at, yes, a decline in \~2-3 months, a period of economic rebound throughout the summer, and then a significantly more potent round of virus. Do what you will with this info, but considering estimates for vaccine time frame are all hovering around a year, it appears poo will hit the turbine like never before this coming autumn and winter. (see above graph and make comparisons) I don't think I have to mention that the magnitude of this whole situation is way higher than the Spanish Flu from a global perspective, considering how intertwined global civilization is. 

Remember, everyone's in this together, and long term this will probably mean a larger emphasis on public health and community support if we're abiding by the example of 1918-1919. Do what you will with the info, but definitely stay safe and healthy, and stay resilient.

Now, since options expire every day or every other day with SPY, could I theoretically do this repeatedly during the week?

Seems like to me that there is little risk in making a few hundred dollars a day or every other day, as long as you put the csp's so far out of money that you wont ever get assigned. And also assuming that if you do get assigned you don't sell for lose and sell covered calls to make up the differences.

Is my line of thinking correct? Could I potentially sell 2 SPY 3/30 240P, and then on 3/31 I would have to sell csp's for 4/1, so in theory I can do this 3 times a week and potentially secured $1000 dollars a week.

TL;DR: I missed a ten bagger on Boeing calls this week by placing a buy order with two minutes left in the trading day which didn‚Äôt fill, switched to puts after big run which promptly lost almost all value.


On Tuesday, March 24th, I attempted to buy BA 145c 3/27 right at close, 3 contracts for $3.05 each (roughly $1,000). Earlier that day, Boeing had a major run up from about $100 to about $127 at close. My thought was, this could be a short term trend that continues for at least the next day with the stimulus bill pending and it would probably take a lot to bring it back down given all the known problems at the company.
Well I placed the order at 3:58 and of course it didn‚Äôt fill. And of course the next day, Wednesday, there‚Äôs another huge run up to close around $165. ‚ÄúMy‚Äù calls from the previous day went from $3.05 to $21. Crap, well right before close, at about 3:58, I decided to buy some 155 puts 3/27 (again roughly $1,000) because there‚Äôs no way there could be a three day run like that! The ole gamblers fallacy. Well, we come here today, BA closed at $185 and ‚Äúmy‚Äù calls are now worth between $35 and $40 each (depending on time of day/accuracy of spreads).

So instead of making $10,000+ on calls, my puts are down about 83%.

Conclusion: call me Jon Snow because I know nothing.

The people bought the dip,

And again,

And once more,

The people conjured the V-Shaped one,

The people thought,

We have the best economy in the world,

Our financial strenght is tremendous,

The people gathered around in picnics,

They gave no fucks,

They thought ""My, what a great level to buy"",

But since the beginning of time,

The people were asleep,

Waiting for the herd to sheep,

They just went with the crowd,

And that's how,

Until the very brawl,

That decides the whole world,

They all died,

Out of üåàüêÇüí© FOMO.

""Using [history](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-21/doug-ramsey-s-best-case-for-stocks-and-other-views-of-the-future) as an imperfect guide, there‚Äôs reason to be skeptical -- it‚Äôs taken stocks an average of 18 months to start to recover after first signs of an economic contraction. But with trillions of dollars of stimulus landing, the case for bottom feeding also exists. ""

Provides 6 views from 6 people:

1. "" ‚ÄúThe bottom will come potentially when we see sentiment completely washed out or everybody totally selling indiscriminately and giving up,‚Äù Roland said by phone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite there yet.‚Äù ""
2. "" the intermittent rallies over the last few weeks are a signal of where the market really wants to go. Those rallies could be challenged by any negative news surrounding the virus, but there‚Äôs a sense of relief over the prospects for fiscal stimulus. ""  ‚ÄúThe market is placing its vote on cyclicals and momentum and growth, it‚Äôs looking towards that‚Äù 
3. ""Normally, a 10% market decline lasts a year, while it takes about 1 1/2 years to recover from a 20% drop...  The S&amp;P 500 fell as much as 34% ""  ‚ÄúMarket timing is notoriously impossible to forecast, and there are too many unknowns at this point. ""
4. "" What‚Äôs important now is that Congress pass its $2 trillion spending bill to help shore up the U.S. economy. More negative economic data will likely challenge the market, but support is coming. ‚ÄúThe stimulus is definitely what investors are looking at versus those horrible weekly numbers,‚Äù he said by phone. ‚ÄúCongress went big and I think it‚Äôs worked so far for investors.‚Äù""
5. ""The expectation of fiscal support is already priced into markets, and going forward, there‚Äôs probably going to be a void of good news... Investors still need more clarity on the economic impact of the virus, the extent of credit risk, and assurance the market is functioning smoothly.... I think case numbers have yet to spike in the U.S.,‚Äù Goodwin said by phone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not out of the woods yet.‚Äù""
6.  ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt fundamentally anything that‚Äôs change with that company. We‚Äôve just seen a drop in demand for its product and a very well understood reason for that drop in demand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith a stimulus package on the way, it‚Äôs reasonable to assume the shortfall is temporary.‚Äù 

TLDR: It usually takes longer than what we're seeing for a bull market to pop up. Stonks will keep going up if government keeps printing unlimited tendies, stonks go down when everyone starts dying.

This NY doctor says ""[**we are not fine**](https://www.nytimes.com/video/nyregion/100000007052136/coronavirus-elmhurst-hospital-queens.html)"". Kudos to her for showing us the reality.

At the current rate, the number of ""reported"" confirmed cases are **doubling every 3 days**. [Source](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)  

Note that the actual case is a lot more than ""reported"" due to the asymptomatic cases. Scientists estimated the **actual case is around x50 times** of the reported cases. [Source](https://medium.com/@Jason_Scott_Warner/the-sober-math-everyone-must-understand-about-the-pandemic-2b0145881993)

The **growth is exponentia**l, what does it mean? 

* In 1 week, the number of cases will increase by x4 times
* In 2 weeks, the number of cases will increase by x32 times
* In 3 weeks, the number of cases will increase by x128 times
* In 4 weeks, the number of cases will increase by x512 times
* In a month, the number of cases will increase by **x1024 times**
* There are currently 85,000 cases in the US. If people don't act now, in a month, there will be **85,000,000 cases** in the US. Assuming a conservative 2% fatality rate, **1,700,000 people will die** from COVID19.

**Let us see - before next Monday, we'll see \~160,000 infected. After next week (by April 6), there will more than half a million infected.**

The math is so simple yet many people just don't get it - it is serious. This is not about losing your money in the stock market, this is about losing your life or your loved ones. The real panic is yet to come. So where is this optimistic buying coming from?

Primary dealer are ""counterparties"" of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy, aka banks and other financial institutions which make a trade with the Fed.

Thats right your trusty old bank down the street no longer needs to keep any x% of money on hand for reserves. They can make it rain loans to your boyfriends girlfriend so she can start that primo dildo shop they've always wanted to start together, with everyone of your hard earned dollars and keep 0 of it in the vault.

The Primary Dealers current have over 1.5 trillion in reserves that they can shell out right now you think there going to keep that cash at the Fed sitting there collecting dust FUCK NO, they're going out the corporate bond market and stock market and swallowing 1.5T worth of equities because why the fuck not? The reason they don't give a fuck is the Fed will now accept those 100c on the dollar as collateral for funny money from the fed with PDCF. What stops the Primary Dealers from buying calls on SPY at 240 and then injecting trillions into the market to reach the strike + some and then when things go south sell the equities to the Fed for a ""90 day"" ""non-recourse"" I might add ""loan."" The Primary Dealers literally have no incentive not to buy equities right now and then hand them off to the Fed.

Next up nobody is going to go bankrupt. Why because of MMLF: Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility boom boom boom. The Money Market Fund is where businesses and retail investors can make a trade to acquire corporate debt. You buy Mutual Fund A, Mutual Fund A goes out and buys bonds from XYZ corp, XYZ corp issues bonds i.e. debt and wallah the cycle is complete. But wait all of a sudden comes in the Corona boi and suddenly it turns out everyones on the brink of insolvency because we've had 10 years of Fed policy which made money cheap and basically penalized companies for not taking on risk but I digress. So everyone notices that XYZ corp is on the brink of bankruptcy so now nobody wants to give them money for their shit fucking bat soup bonds. As a result bond prices go down interest rates go up and nobody wants to take on the risk plus everyone realizes everyones insolvent so everyone sells their bonds making interest rates rise. So what does the Fed do they make the printer machines go BRRRRRRRRRR lend it to he Money Market Fund and then the Money Market Fund gives the bond as collateral to the Fed allowing all that corporate debt to keep on churning. So guess what Money Market Funds are going to keep buying shit debt and the Fed's going to eat it all up while your puts expire to 0.

Part 2 of nobody is going bankrupt. CPFF: Commercial Paper Funding Facility Basically here XYZ corp is bankrupt and needs to pay bills, they can issue debt and the Fed can make a ""loan"" and buy the debt in the commercial paper market to directly pay their loans. In this case the Fed buys the debt i.e. bonds from XYZ corp and gets to pay down all their debt with 0 revenue coming in. That's right all you SIX put holders bend over and lube up Jerome is going to personally spray money into SIX with a leafblower and there going to live to see another day even if 97% of the worlds population dies from Corona.

Lets also not forget a 2 TRILLION TRILLION WITH A T stimulus was just passed where the government is going to wrack up that national debt to helicopter money into every who dick and num nut. Forget Andrew Yang UBI is here motherfuckers and it starts with your dearest politicians shoving 1.2 into your poor fucking asses. Sorry I'm just made that I won't get any stim money since I make way more that 75k a year.

fpqyuj,JackThoma5,üåàüêª vs the üåàFED,"Fellow autists,

The summer of 2018 was a great year for me. I was daytrading small cap stocks every day. The sun was bright and the money was green. Huge tits could be seen on the chest of local MILF‚Äôs during my daily strolls at the local target. (With the quarantine this is now no more)

The market was ripping everyday so small cap stocks were running up faster than a kenyan whenever good news popped. My only enemy at the time was the üåàüêª‚Äôs who would come and short the stock in the last hour of trading causing mass panic and everyone to sell. Ironically, in a month...I would become the üåàüêª that I once hated so much. 

You see autists, in October of 2018 the small cap stocks weren‚Äôt running anymore. It took me a day or two to find out why. I realized that it was because the entire market was starting to go down. Once I reviewed some further evidence being gold, bonds, yield curve, china slowdown, and the oil market...I knew that the market was going to go down a lot more. 

Basically the üåà FED was raising interest rates trying to take the debt off their massive üçÜ of a balance sheet. Which caused panic in the markets and along with oil going down and the slowdown in China the market did a mini crash.

I played puts from October when SPY was over $290 all the way to December 24th when SPY hit $233. I played puts on multiple stocks like AAPL which went from $230‚Äôs to $142. I made a ton of money and I was a king. 

The üåàFED though became public enemy number 1 for the üåàüêª‚Äôs at the end of December. They switched sides on me. They literally went from raising rates to fucking lowering them. Not only this but üåàSecretary Treasure Mnunchin literally said on December 24th, one of the days where I had my biggest gains, that he was going to be meeting with the üåàPPT (plunge protection team). Literally the day after Christmas we had one our biggest bull rallies ever. The goddamn PPT was buying all the stock. This was market manipulation at it‚Äôs finest. I was pissed. Long story short the FED continued to keep rates low and SPY did a SLOW painful climb back to it‚Äôs original level which it didn‚Äôt reach again until April 2019. The painful part was even when I was right (bad earnings, more bad news about China slowdown) the goddamn stocks kept going up. It drove me crazy. (kind of like today with goddamn unemployment numbers)

The üåàFED killed my goddamn volatility. I fucking love volatility because you can make so much damn money with options in such a short period of time. If VIX was a thicc women I def would of put a ring on her. 

There are a ton of similar things going on right now in todays time. I bought puts back on January 31st in anticipation for the virus to crash the market. Oil market is now tanking, stocks tanked, it was beautiful. Fuck...it was such a panic even gold and bonds were tanking which usually they go up in a time of crisis. Now, once again, you have the üåàFED with                üåàMnunchin coming in trying to pump the market and kill volatility. 

My lesson learned in 2018 was don‚Äôt fight the üåàFED. However, this fucking virus is literally a plague that‚Äôs killing tons of people and shutting down the world and all supply chains. The üåàFED knows this and is so scared that their tits are running dry of milk. I mean come on, first emergency rate cut since 2008, then another emergency rate cut, then infinite QE, and now the king of debt stimulus package which is going to make their üçÜ balance sheet get blue balls from how swollen it is. 

They‚Äôre in full panic mode with this shit. Doing shit that hasn‚Äôt been done since 2008. This tells me what they‚Äôre saying and doing are two opposite things. They‚Äôre saying everything is going to be ok in a few weeks but then they‚Äôre taking drastic measures that would only be done in a time when there is a SERIOUS THREAT TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE ECONOMY. 

What did that old hairy fart tell me at the bar that one day? Oh yeah it was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt listen to what they say but watch what they do‚Äù

Well üåàüêª‚Äôs this is it. It‚Äôs time to short the shit out everything. No stock is safe. When an entire market collapses, even your grandmas panty stock is going tits up. The üåàFED has the money printer on max power, but you can‚Äôt fight a fucking plague with money. Everythings getting shutdown, people aren‚Äôt going to go out and live a normal life for probably the next 6 months at a minimum. Shits just starting to get heated in the USA and soon your wifes panties are going to be hitting the fan from how rich you are. 

It‚Äôs time we get our revenge on the üåàFED for killing my hoe volatility back in 2018. I had bought puts on January 31st and made over 150K last week. I used almost all of those profits to buy almost 6,000 puts for June 19th, 2020 on SPY, TSLA, and SPX. Why? Because the party is just getting started. All the indicators for a perfect storm are there. It‚Äôs exactly what I saw in 2018 when I played the market down but it‚Äôs on GODDAMN STERIODS. 

My price targets are SPY $163 and TSLA $150-$200 by May 15th. Laugh all you want, I‚Äôm sure you would of laughed at me if I told you TSLA was going to be trading in the $350‚Äôs only 34 days after it hit $968. So fuck you üåàüêÇ‚Äôs

The FED is getting piled in more debt while we will become richer. This is payback. This is war. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You ride with the bulls on this one and you‚Äôre gonna die with the bulls. The partys just getting started and with this üåàrally it‚Äôs not too late to get in and make bank. Join the üåàüêª‚Äôs and forever prosper. The markets about to go tits up. 

TLDR; Buy puts for June.

fpqp6z,rcklmbr,Technical analysis and market predictions using Google Sheets,"Hold onto your tendies, but at this point I'm fairly confident I have a solid strategy for predicting the market -- at least as far as single stocks go.

In short, Google Sheets provides a lot of functionality that helps evaluate stock values, but right now I want to point out 2 key features that when combined can result in accurate predictions:

1. You can lookup a stock price by running a function `=GOOGLEFINANCE(""nasdaq:spce"")`.
2. You can represent durations by using a function representing the period you want the duration for.  For example, you can use `=DAYS(7)` for a 7 day duration.

Now used alone, each one of these are fairly rudimentary.  However, if you combine them, you can get accurate predictions.  As an example, to get the value of a stock in 6 days time, use the function `=GOOGLEFINANCE(""nasdaq:spce"") + DAYS(6)`  That will give you the price in dollars, and you can place your trades accordingly.  Note that this works best if you do HFT, but works just as well when combined with the Robinhood app.

I hope this helps you all, we are a small community and we are absolutely turning this market upside down.",26,1585283601,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqp6z/technical_analysis_and_market_predictions_using/,wallstreetbets,1

PDCF stands for Primary Dealer Credit Facility what is the primary dealer? Good question maybe your not retarded after all...

Primary dealer are ""counterparties"" of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy, aka banks and other financial institutions which make a trade with the Fed.

You may have heard that the Federal Reserve earlier this month removed the reserve requirement for banks. Thats right your trusty old bank down the street no longer needs to keep any x% of money on hand for reserves. They can make it rain loans to your boyfriends girlfriend so she can start that primo dildo shop they've always wanted to start together, with everyone of your hard earned dollars and keep 0 of it in the vault.

The Primary Dealers current have over 1.5 trillion in reserves that they can shell out right now you think there going to keep that cash at the Fed sitting there collecting dust FUCK NO, they're going out the corporate bond market and stock market and swallowing 1.5T worth of equities because why the fuck not? The reason they don't give a fuck is the Fed will now accept those 100c on the dollar as collateral for funny money from the fed with PDCF. What stops the Primary Dealers from buying calls on SPY at 240 and then injecting trillions into the market to reach the strike + some and then when things go south sell the equities to the Fed for a ""90 day"" ""non-recourse"" I might add ""loan."" The Primary Dealers literally have no incentive not to buy equities right now and then hand them off to the Fed.

Next up nobody is going to go bankrupt. Why because of MMLF: Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility boom boom boom. The Money Market Fund is where businesses and retail investors can make a trade to acquire corporate debt. You buy Mutual Fund A, Mutual Fund A goes out and buys bonds from XYZ corp, XYZ corp issues bonds i.e. debt and wallah the cycle is complete. But wait all of a sudden comes in the Corona boi and suddenly it turns out everyones on the brink of insolvency because we've had 10 years of Fed policy which made money cheap and basically penalized companies for not taking on risk but I digress. So everyone notices that XYZ corp is on the brink of bankruptcy so now nobody wants to give them money for their shit fucking bat soup bonds. As a result bond prices go down interest rates go up and nobody wants to take on the risk plus everyone realizes everyones insolvent so everyone sells their bonds making interest rates rise. So what does the Fed do they make the printer machines go BRRRRRRRRRR lend it to he Money Market Fund and then the Money Market Fund gives the bond as collateral to the Fed allowing all that corporate debt to keep on churning. So guess what Money Market Funds are going to keep buying shit debt and the Fed's going to eat it all up while your puts expire to 0.

Part 2 of nobody is going bankrupt. CPFF: Commercial Paper Funding Facility Basically here XYZ corp is bankrupt and needs to pay bills, they can issue debt and the Fed can make a ""loan"" and buy the debt in the commercial paper market to directly pay their loans. In this case the Fed buys the debt i.e. bonds from XYZ corp and gets to pay down all their debt with 0 revenue coming in. That's right all you SIX put holders bend over and lube up Jerome is going to personally spray money into SIX with a leafblower and there going to live to see another day even if 97% of the worlds population dies from Corona.

Lets also not forget a 2 TRILLION TRILLION WITH A T stimulus was just passed where the government is going to wrack up that national debt to helicopter money into every who dick and num nut.

They are trying to get you scared of a fake ass virus.China was the first country to have over 100,000 5G towers and the virus started there and people in Wuhan were the first to be infected by it. This 5G was planned years ago to depopulate us and keep us at a low vibrational energy. Bill Gates is the one who created this along with the weird entities who control the world. He also is creating a vaccine for this so-called virus and enforce it on everyone. These vaccines are literally microchips which can be used to control us and control billions of people across the world. They can literally control and look at people's whereabouts, thoughts and actions. Not only can they can end your life with a push of a button. They know in order to have millions of people take these vaccines they first need to create a fake virus. Smh it grinds my gears that you humans are brainwashed enough to believe wtf the news and media puts out there. Wake tf up and start researching the truths behind these weird agendas they keep creating. Y'all out there with masks and shit when there isnt any virus. These Chinese doctors are actors, this shit is scripted OUT. Its 5G towers that are killing people, not this fake ass virus and no mask in the world can stop them from frying your brains. If you dont wake tf up now, this shit finna kill us. But of course y'all gonna think Im crazy for saying this. Smh fucking robots

fpqf7b,curiousofa,GM Building Mass Ventilators = Fake News = People Can't Breathe,"On Sunday, Trump tweeted out that auto execs were teaming up to build much needed ventilators.  It appears, the auto execs never got the full logistics of the buildout and who was paying. 

GM initially said that they could turn their car factory and use auto transmissions to quickly build 20,000 ventilators. Turns out that was false, and they realized that auto transmissions do not have much in common with ventilators and they maybe will be able to get 5000 out. 

The administration is back at square one and talking with other manufacturers to get realistic pricing and ventilator numbers. Even if they are able to find a manufacturer in the next week, do we expect them to turn out 20,000+(still a low number) ventilators within a month? If so, what will the infection and severe cases look like by then? 

I wonder if Donny's optimistic tweets and outlook helps the market pump? If it does, reality should hit and we realize that Uncle Donny was only speaking in hyperbole and market should correct for that?

My aunt lives in rural Alabama and was feeling sick for almost a week until my cousin forced her to go see a doctor.  Symptoms were as you would expect.  Feeling tired, running fever, and shortness of breath.  She has a lot of comorbidities like diabetes (because bama) so that doesn't help.

She was admitted to the hospital in a large city and over the course of the past week they have had to put her on a ventilator and drained fluid off of her lungs multiple times.  Finally today (one week later), they move her to an isolated part of the hospital and have tested her for corona virus.  Test result still pending.  She should live although we don't know for sure yet but just wanted to put it out there that this thing is just getting started and it's starting to hit rural parts of the country.  The worst part is hospitals in these areas aren't even taking it seriously.  The worst is yet to come.

fppo3t,ja453,Send energy and prayers to Gay Bear üôèüåàüêª,"Dear mr Gay Bear, 

I discovered your following alongside the Retard Bulls on r/wallstreetbets. I was immediately inspired to join one of your affiliations but I wasn‚Äôt sure I was ready to take dick up my ass and I also wasn‚Äôt sure if I had to become more retarded to be a bull, which would have been very not good seeing as I am already extremely retarded. 

This March made the decision very easy for me as the Retarded Bulls we‚Äôre getting fucked in the ass by Gay Bears and if I‚Äôm going to be getting fucked in the ass either way, I might as well be gay. So I became a believer of the Gay Bear creed and initiated myself by putting all of my moneys into poots so that they can be turned into tendies üêî.

Within a couple weeks the magic poots transformed my 5k moneys into 10k tendies which is a far better deal. I mean what would you rather have? Green paper or delicious tendies?? 

Everything has been going well and I am extremely happy to be a gay bear and grateful to you mr Gay Bear üåàüêª... but recently the Big Boy they call Donny Trumper and the FED‚Äôs (FurryEvilDinos) have unleashed the unlimited tendies works. I am not sure what this is but according to the wizards of WSB it is an evil machine that goes ‚Äúbrrrrrrrrr‚Äù and produces tendies out of seemingly nowhere. I don‚Äôt think this is true because ever since the machine has been doing the ‚Äúbrrrrrrr‚Äù my tendies in my poot machine have been disappearing :(

So mr Gay Bear üåàüêª I am here to plead that you destroy the evil tendie-stealing machine that the FED‚Äôs and Donny Trumpet üé∫ are using. I am sorry to ask so much from you but my tendies are all but gone and so are the tendies of my fellow gay bears in WSB. Some are even beginning to lose faith due to fear of the unlimited tendies machine. But I will never stop believing in you mr Gay Bear üåàüêª and I know there are others like me. 

To all followers, Send your energy and prayers to the Gay Bear üåàüêª and make sure to keep your asshole fresh and lubed so that he may enter whenever he pleases.

We still have a bit more red ahead of us, perhaps a lot. Yeah I get it this is  different. You can't compare past performance to current. Except, this is a lot worse of a scenario. In 2009 people could still go to work! I know crazy right? Unemployment has risen to about 5.5% already with much higher expected. The peak unemployment in 2009 was 10%. Hospitals weren't at capacity in 2009. Once that happens(which is inevitable if Daddy Pump let's us all go back out and about in a few weeks) a lot of people will die. If not from the virus, from not being able to get the medical care they need in the case of literally any other life threatening medical situation. The $1200 will last most people what, a few weeks? Then what? I highly doubt this will be over in a few weeks. People will still be unemployed. Companies get tax breaks but they don't have workers to produce. I hate to be the bad news bear but this is just the tip... Of a cock in my ass because I'm a üåàüêª.

1. We're  sheltering in place through may, then off and on again for 18ish months until we have a vaccination
2. We're opening up the economy and overrunning hospitals.  Imagine how Americans are going to react when people are dying in the waiting room at their local hospital.  They're already bringing refrigeration trucks to back up morgues. More panic buying, people putting those guns to use, we're gonna see chaos from mid april - may.

fppk54,Sti8man7,Why the market will continue to melt up,"Bears have been emboldened through the March 9th crash, growing with every limit down. They were a picture of solidarity, a comaradeire forged so strong that was not seen outside of bullet ridden battlefields.

But all that came to a smattering end this week following the disappointing outcome of the ""quad witching""(never focus your energy on these highly touted watershed moments). Bears are in total disarray as they see their tendies burnt to the core as they mount frantic counter attack one after another only to be rebuffed by the market onslaught. 

Signs that stock market is going to melt up:

The big sell down has suckered in new bears and embolden old bears to DOUBLE down on their PUTS and this has spectacularly blown up in their face. But hold up here, it's just been a week and markets have clearly switched from busting longs to  now busting shorts. We are just getting started here boys.

Bulls that I speak to are still cautious, taking baby steps back to the market. The Bull to Bear Boldness Index(BBB Index) still clearly favors a upwards market. Bears disarray will turn to despair before markets will turn again.",42,1585278603,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fppk54/why_the_market_will_continue_to_melt_up/,wallstreetbets,1
fppilf,NovercaIis,Sbux Intel of 1 store,"so sbux offered all partners the option to stay at home for 30 days and get paid. I opted for it so I can play the market :)

ANYWAYS

So my store is a DT store and I decided to go in today to pick up my tip money from last week. This is what I found out....

* 1) Out of 25 partners, 3 of us took the month option
* ---a partner who works once a week
* ---a 18yr old partner who lives with parents
* ---an autistic degenerate who wants to day-trade for the next 30 days

* 2) My store usually does 875-950 customers per day. Currently they are doing 650 customers on avg.

* 3) My store usually makes on avg $5300 per day. Currently they are avg about $4500 a day.

* Sbux insensitized (sp?) anyone who opted to work will get a temp $3/hr and Overtime is approved. 

* Sbux also recently announced, if you are working, you get 1 additional partner mark out on food and on drinks per work day. Also any partners not working are entitled to also get 1 partner markout on food or drink during their days off. After that there is a 50% discount on any other purchases, an increase from 20% previously. 

* Sbux also has a dedicated Covid-19 CUP Fund. Cup Fund is usually reserved for emergency and u need some money. I dont know what the max is on normal times. But they have allocated $500 per partner for the Covid-19. Reading the form, it seems almost anything will be approved for this special cup fund and I am sure many partners will be taking advantage of a free $500 no strings attached.

&gt;My glass-half-full assessment is further supported by the potentially large rebalancing that is coming our way over the next week. My back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio in mid-February has now become a 51/49 portfolio, entirely on the basis of market action. This is very large drift in a very short time. Given the many trillions of dollars in assets that follow some sort of multi-asset class approach, the coming rebalance could well be in the range of a few hundred billion.


It's official.

Basically these assholes are abusing retirement funds under their management to bailout the themselves. I guess for the next week or two, we will see a daily price ceiling each day (258 today, maybe 262 tomorrow, increasing each day) when they unload their positions to retirement funds.

fppce3,kenkennedyho,Why DIS is Screwed,"  

Why DIS is seriously fucked! According to FactSet, 87% of DIS revenue comes from its Consumer Services. 31% of that is related to its hospitality services such as hotels and amusement parks. We all know why that segment fucked so there‚Äôs no need to explain. Parks closed = no money. Even if beer virus were to have a cure, it‚Äôll take years for the park to regain attendance. 

The remaining 56% is its Media and Publishing services which comprises of 2 segments: Television cable &amp; Broadcast Networks (40%), so like the ESPN, ABC, etc and Video Entertainment (16%) Pixar, Marvel films. Because of the rise in cord cutting, they‚Äôve been declining in that segment for the past 5-8 years, which led them to want to make Disney Plus. Despite Disney Plus doing well in subscribers, they are still losing money in that segment and its still relatively small, any subscriber growth in that aren‚Äôt going to move the needle. 

Regarding their revenues for films, all their recent movies were basically delayed because aint nobody going to theaters now. Fear will persist and attendances will only slowly be regained. Also, the current filming production that they were working on or planning are also delayed or cancelled. This is going to cause a huge slowdown regarding upcoming releases. There‚Äôs no fucking way they do well this upcoming earnings release on May. 62% of their revenue is in the US and this virus shit is just getting started as Trump is as incompetent as our fellow autists. We are just going to continue our quarantine longer and longer. People are severely underestimating how the economic impact and fear will sustain much longer.

if by october spy is below 277 put shares, i will be put shares 277. will receive full credit for 277, close out short share position , for net of approx $3000. which will bring my cost basis to spy 247. I am okay with being long spy at this price. Will average down after this point.

fponxs,NotGonnaGetBanned,COVID-19 social-isolation based public health policies will be the biggest scandal in world history,"tl;dr

The cost of care for the current isolation-based policies is probably thousands of times more costly than what is generally accepted as ""cost effective"" ($100,000 per QALY gained).

Puts. 

/tl;dr

I have only seen a couple articles on this topic. It appears that there is a deliberate attempt to avoid or silence this discussion.

The first is [Economic Cost of Flattening the Curve](https://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/economic-cost-of-flattening-the-curve/) by Eline van den Broek-Altenburg and Adam Atherly:

&gt;If the total investment was $4 trillion, the cost per QALY gained would rise to a range of $300,000 to $2.5 million per QALY gained ‚Äî an expenditure far out of line from other healthcare investments.

&gt;...

&gt;Our calculations suggest that current strategies will be cost effective only if the predicted mortality rates are at the top of the predicted range and costs are at the bottom of the range ‚Äì a combination of worst care / best case that is unlikely. Consideration of¬†targeted mitigation strategies¬†that minimize the economic cost while protecting the most vulnerable are warranted.

The second is [Cost Benefit Analysis of Flattening the Curve](https://www.econlib.org/cost-benefit-analysis-of-flattening-the-curve/) by David Henderson:

&gt;That means that their [van den Broek-Altenburg and Atherly's] conclusion is understated.

&gt;...

&gt;Why do I say their conclusion is understated? They‚Äôve probably got the order of magnitude right on the cost side even though theirs is not an estimate of the cost. But by assuming all lives are saved, even those that are already lost, they may well have at least doubled the number of quality-adjusted life years saved.


The conclusion of the first article is that the course of action we are taking is between 300% and 2,500% more costly than what is accepted to be cost effective treatment.

The second article says the conclusions of the first article should be doubled because we will probably only save 50% of the people who are likely to die, not 100% (which was erroneously assumed in the first article).

When the actual expected outcome of the current isolation policies is probably actually a 10% to 30% reduction of deaths, wouldn't that really mean that the current policies are between 1,000% to 25,000% more costly than what would normally be considered cost effective?

Doesn't this indicate that the current policies are nothing more than a cynical attempt by our politicians and the administrators of our health care systems to avoid embarrassment? So that when everything falls apart in the future, they will be able to point to all the money spent and say: ""We did everything we could. This is your fault for not isolating better.""

fpof3k,rushinrussia,Update From a Few Days Ago (I'm the Guy With Suspected Bat Flu) ( $ME 0p 5/1),"Hey guys. This shit will be short. I wanted to give you an idea of how fucked things are where I am (west coast). 

A few days ago I posted about how my roommate in Dublin had the bat flu and told me. This was worrying as I had had some symptoms. In the past few days they have only gotten worse, with some chest (left rib) pain, body aches, more severe fatigue, and, what finally got me to go in, tightness in my throat and some more labored breathing. 

Called ahead, they gave me a mask when I came in, immediately sat me in a room to be seen by staff. Both the nurse and the doctor that saw me were in full PPE, head to toe. Even with my symptoms, I do no qualify for a test, and they said they now have guidance from the state to simply presume a patient is positive if they are showing enough symptoms/have had exposure. That is how low testing supplies are. And my state has not even been hit hard yet. 

More concerning, is the lack of specific guidance I could get from the doctor. They told me that I am approaching the second week if I do in fact have it, which we are now presuming, and that is when shit gets way worse for most people who will eventually develop bad symptoms.

Great. 

When I pressed and asked what to look out for, they really did not have any answers. High fever is always a red flag, but they said the only real indicator they have is when your breathing is already bad. So basically, you'll know you are fucked when you are already fucked. They told me to isolate by myself for at least the next 4 days. 

I'm not going to tell you how to make money off of this. If you're not totally fucking stupid you can understand that there is not even a good handle on this situation. No one knows shit, and supplies are non existent even where outbreaks have not occurred. 

Stay safe idiots, and don't let any of this dissuade you from going to the doctor/hospital if you have severe symptoms. Some areas will surely be more prepared, but holy hell if this isn't fucked. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am a presumed case, not enough tests even for someone with confirmed close contact and multiple symptoms, doctors have very little idea of what the warning sings are for a potentially dangerous case vs. a mild one.",102,1585273929,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpof3k/update_from_a_few_days_ago_im_the_guy_with/,wallstreetbets,1

Four walls just staring at a retard

fpodtx,Painpita,Why would china lie about Covid19?,"Ok so I hear this so much on here. ""China's lying about Covid19 amount of cases"", ""China has so much more cases"", ""China slept with my wife"", ""Puts on china"", etc...

I just want to understand one thing? What can possibly lead you retards to believe China has any incentive or capability to lie about the amount of cases? This virus is out, doctors around the world are fighting it and the best papers on it came from China. 

There is ALOT of great scientifical data gathered by China, they shut down everything, and now they are closing their international boarders because you morons can't get your shit together and stay home.

Please tell me one incentive for China to lie about cases? Keep the economy going? Dude people would die. Kill the USD? They own the most USD out of any country. Destroy US economy? China's economy is based on our western economy for a few years out still.

So tell me why do you Autist keep thinking China lies about Covid19 cases? It's probably just because it make you guys feel better about the fact that USA really can't get its shit together ""Greatest country in the world, with the most wealth"" can't even deal with a virus that overpopulated China destroyed in a few months.

China literally shut down **EVERYTHING** for a couple weeks and that‚Äôs what flattened the curve for them. We aren‚Äôt even shutting things down, this is going to get way worse until the US forces the entire country to stay inside for 2 weeks (at least)!

You may say, ‚Äúwell, China is lying and has more unreported cases than we do‚Äù and I would counter with ‚Äúthanks for making my point...they have *more* cases even after shutting things down and forcing people to stay inside for weeks!‚Äù

This outbreak is going to be **out of control** in the next week or two because Trump wants to fix the economy. I believe this will ultimately cost him the presidency once people realize how poorly he‚Äôs handled everything.

An example product might be a fund that holds 60% stocks / 40% bonds - This is a typical ratio for these types of funds. Firms typically have to re-balance these products to maintain the ratio every quarter (some do it monthly but most do it quarterly). End of current quarter is next week.

Since we've had a massive drop in stocks, these products are now massively out of balance at maybe 40-50% stocks, and 50-60% bonds. I think this buying that we're seeing is from these firms.

Now that we have touched the 20 day, we will see the next leg down which is going to come faster than the 10 seconds it takes for you to cum.

Also, if you were too dumb to notice...we had 13,500 cases 7 days ago. Now we have over 80,000. We had 200 deaths 7 days ago. Now almost 1,200 deaths. 

What the fuck do you think it‚Äôs going to look like in 2 months you dumb bulls? Especially if Trump doesn‚Äôt do a national shutdown.

fpnonw,Inflictedinsight,Public Fear through Degrees of Separation,"I live in the SF Bay Area, my theory for why the market is rallying despite increasing case numbers:

1.	It is easy to get used to large numbers. 20,000 cases last week and 80,000 cases today are both a lot of cases. 3 million unemployed is a lot of people, but we were expecting a lot already. Old news. Priced in.
2.	The market may be reacting more emotionally to the coronavirus. I believe a more emotional reaction to the coronavirus is not case number of death number, but wether you personally know someone affected.
3.	Within the last week, everyone I work with started sharing stories of ‚Äúmy brother‚Äôs coworker got tested positive,‚Äù or ‚Äúmy friends mom is in the hospital now.‚Äù In other words, my estimate is that the average person is now about **2 degrees of separation ** away from the coronavirus itself (meaning we know someone who knows someone sick)

fpne4g,ChiTown_Bound,"If you have patience and $10k, here‚Äôs a freebie for you.","I just had to explain my lung out to an uneducated asshole. I wrote this in response to why he should buy LEAPS on SPY. Some of you nogs are gonna nog, I get it, but if you aren‚Äôt retarded just read this once.

It is a medium term investment of more than 2 years, with the option to buy at the strike. Right now premiums are very volatile, and being 2 1/2 years away from expiry and a possible near bottom in the foreseeable future. 

Ill do the math; basic shot at my way of seeing this play. 

You have $10,000 to buy up investments with. Say today you took that $10,000 and bought 90 contracts
of SPY 12/16/22 Expiry at $500 at 1.12 premium, thats $112 per contract, times 90, thats $10,080 total investment. Volatility is high my friend, and boomers are taking their money out the banks, while younger generations like myself can‚Äôt wait for the bottom‚Äîit means a new bull rally, which every bull run in history is exponentially bigger than the one before it. This means that the chance of touching $500 is highly likely. The fed did this once in the 80‚Äôs, once in 2008/2009, and both led to bull runs. 

Anyways...see these explanations.

Here is the percentage profits on that trade with the calendar dates pretty far out (the chart goes further)

Profit Percentages by Strike x Date &gt; https://imgur.com/a/MHp60Qw

Here is what you will have if it gets back to $350 by February 2021 &gt; https://imgur.com/a/If4VBo1

And say you got lucky and the market came back very hard - a lot of momentum on the upside, more volatility and it touches a new high of $400 then you my friend would have what is known as a ‚Äú10-bagger‚Äù in one year, scraping clean with $118,080 minus your initial 10,080, and you scrape out clean with $108,000. Set some aside for taxes and go. &gt; https://imgur.com/a/KSs1wdP

I hope you enjoy reading this, because I enjoyed writing it and feeling it out by explaining it to you has caused me to unintentionally perform a bit of DD. The thing about all of these numbers still leave you with a little less than 2 years to expiry. I‚Äôm probably going to make this play myself once I‚Äôm comfortable we aren‚Äôt in an up down market, because we are clearly way down and LEAPS are a sure fire way to make money, plenty of delta built into premiums right now.

EDIT: Those numbers in the green boxes of the pictures represent your gains in percentage for you little kiddy retards, and I don‚Äôt think millenials will become scared of the market, we can live check to check, so people will keep investing, and the S&amp;P will surpass 350 easily. I‚Äôm of course being optimistic, and you have to be.


TL;DR

12/16/22 $500c (LEAPs) 90 contracts will cost
you $10k, payout in a year is $40-108k.",161,1585269921,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpne4g/if_you_have_patience_and_10k_heres_a_freebie_for/,wallstreetbets,1

I read about how Bill Ackman turned $27 mil to $2.6bn by betting on a market crash. I‚Äôd like to bet on a v shaped recovery. My goal is to make a 50x to 100x return. (Anything more than 100x is just gross).

The best way to do this in a way accessible to the common man or woman is through a long dated option. LEAPS like good ole Cornwall Capital.

I like companies hit really hard. Hospitality, entertainment (not entertainment like cable, but entertainment like in person).

So Marriott, Hilton, Dave &amp; Busters etc.

As you can see, the past three days have been FUCKING GREEN.  I FUCKING HATE GREEN BECAUSE I'M AN AUTIST HOLDING PUTS WHO SAID FUCK CALLS, CALLS ARE GAY NOW WHATEVER.  Now, I have major autist FOMO and I hate myself but whatever.

Moving on, the STIMULUS PACKAGE was passed this week.  Good for us artists, an extra $1200 to blow on fucking SPY puts, furthering our nation's faltering economic sentiment and downtrend.  Lovely.  Gay bears want nothing else!

Highly awaited unemployment numbers were released today, some 3.3m unemployed - many of which are creating onlyfans accounts to support their prescription drug habits.

The United States has surpassed China in the number of confirmed and officially reported coronavirus cases, because we fucking win at everything!! Also notice the operative clause in that sentence ""officially reported"" because CHINA IS FUCKING LYING.  Chinese Virus, China Virus, Kung Flu, whatever the fuck you want to call it, these fuckers are lying.  No, I'm not racist.  I don't call it those names, our autist president does.

Monday is BIG fucking red all over again and Tuesday again wiping out these gains.

Green week, bloody monday+Tuesday

Shit companies did amazingly well today. I'm looking at you ctst, acb, hexo. I still don't believe in you. 

Golden boy CGC lagged everyone. People finally realize that burning 1.8b in 18mo probably wasn't a smart thing after all. I see you also canned the Acreage deal and lost 300m in the process. More money well spent.
