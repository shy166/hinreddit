Today, in an effort to elevate Reddit’s diverse opinion-based content, we’re excited to introduce Polls: a brand new post type that encourages redditors to share their opinion via voting. We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community. We believe a simple post type that reduces the posting barrier will make it easier than ever for everyone to contribute to their favorite communities and engage in different ways.

Here’s a look at some of our recent test polls

**Platform Support**

* iOS: Supports poll creation and voting
* Android: Supports poll creation and voting
* New Reddit (web): Supports poll creation and voting
* Old Reddit (web): Does not support creation. At the bottom of a poll, redditors will see a link to view the poll. Clicking the link will open a new tab where they can view results and vote in the poll
* Mobile web: Supports voting. No plans for poll creation support

And now a poll...

f8y9nx,spez,Spring forward… into Reddit’s 2019 transparency report,"**TL;DR: Today we published our 2019** [**Transparency Report**](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019)**. I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all,

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties. 

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019, we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content**, 
   * **55.9k accounts**, and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated). 
* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.

This new award is available alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum from now through Nov. 2, and Reddit will match the first $15,000 of ALL Coins purchased during this time.

[**Purchase Coins today and help support children's hospitals!**](https://www.reddit.com/coins/)

Here are a few details about the limited Extra Life Award:

* The award costs 500 [Coins](https://www.reddit.com/coins/)—the same cost as the Gold award
* The recipient receives a week of [Premium](https://www.reddit.com/premium) and 100 coins—the same benefits as Gold!
* Anyone who gives this award, I'm told, has a heart of gold! (And also a shiny, new trophy at a later date!)
* Reddit will match the first $15,000 of ALL Coin purchases from now through Nov. 2.

**But why?**

Last week [we announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/) our 8th year partnering with Extra Life for our favorite annual tradition: playing ~~24~~ 25 hours of video games to help raise money for sick kids. We're not doing this alone! Thanks to some truly heroic redditors, we have already raised over $40,000 of our $150,000 goal!

However, we recognize not everyone can relinquish the majority of their weekend to play video games (we totally had other plans, we swear). We made this award to make it easier for even more people to get involved and help support one of our favorite charity events.

Have the opposite problem? If your wallet is feeling thin, you can also help by signing up to fundraise! Check out [our recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dmj0sb/join_us_in_supporting_extra_life_a_24hour_gaming/) for more details about joining Team Reddit.

**Reminder: Extra Life Game Day is November 2nd!**

On this coming Saturday a raiding party of staffers here at Reddit HQ will be streaming our fundraising efforts live on our [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/reddit). Tune in and join us for 25 hours of mind-melting gaming and delirious, sleep-deprived antics. From Fortnite to Untitled Goose Game, we'll be playing a variety of games, so join us and you may even get to play head-to-head against an admin in your favorite game!",974,1572540889,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dpqd0z/the_extra_life_charity_award_raise_awareness_for/,announcements,19479

dbf9nj,landoflobsters,Changes to Our Policy Against Bullying and Harassment,"TL;DR is that we’re updating our harassment and bullying policy so we can be more responsive to your reports. 

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding content that [threatens, harasses, or bullies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), which you can read in full [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). 

**Why are we doing this?**
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to quality, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.

The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. 

We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.

**How will these changes work in practice?**
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. 

You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. 

As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our [response times have improved significantly since the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/), but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.

**What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?**
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing &gt; “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too; [report it to us here](https://www.reddit.com/report).

Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.",11433,1569865578,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/,announcements,16097

chdx1h,venkman01,Introducing Community Awards!,"Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

[A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://i.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png)

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Mods can access the Community Bank to give…

# Mod-Exclusive Awards

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* … and so on!

Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

&amp;#x200B;

[This example shows the coveted Golden Toaster Award, which you can view in a larger size by hovering over the icon.](https://i.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png)

# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?

Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.

# Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?

Check out our companion post on [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!

We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:

* They must comply with [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);
* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
* They must be SFW.

# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!

We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!

Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!",1972,1564001958,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/,announcements,12580
cevm31,mjmayank,Update regarding user profile transparency,"Hi everyone,

We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.

We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting 8/29), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.

We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.

If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!

bpfyx1,SingShredCode,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),"Hello hello,

We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...

## What’s New

*New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds*

Multireddits have been around a [long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/). They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.

*More Support*

We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.

[iOS Screenshot](https://i.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png)

*New Follow Functionality*

You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.

[Follow on new Reddit](https://i.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png)

*Improved Sharing*

We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile. 

*Spaces*

You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed. [Enough said.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif)

*Mix and Match*

Follow a mix of communities and profiles.

*Coming Soon*

In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.

## The Contest

We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the [gold](https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif) part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights. 

To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. **It must be public.** Please only submit one feed per category.

Here are the categories that we will award winners from:

* Aww
* Artist Resources
* Beauty
* Books &amp; Writing
* Cool Pictures (images only)
* Discussion (text only)
* Fashion
* Food &amp; Cooking
* Health &amp; Fitness
* Music
* Parenting
* Sports
* Travel
* Wholesome

We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week. 

Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):

* [Some of my favorite communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/singshredcodesubbies/)
* Some of my [voice and singing communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/voices/)
* [Animal Subbies](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/animal_subbies/) (If you know of any cute-animal subs I missed, please comment below)
* [Asks](https://www.reddit.com/user/mujhair/m/asks/)
* Some [Admins’ favorites](https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit/m/admin_faves/) that were mentioned in this [r/askreddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/afzfa7/admins_of_reddit_whats_your_favorite_subreddit/) a few months ago

aq9h0k,spez,Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff),"Hi all,

Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

9uobsx,LastBluejay,It’s Election Day 2018 and We’ve Compiled Some Resources to Help You Vote,"Redditors of all stripes spend a lot of time talking about politics, and today is the day to take those views straight to the ballot box. It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.

**Where do I vote?**

Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office ([find yours here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.

There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area. [The Voting Information Tool](https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/) is one of the easiest to use.

**Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?**

It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so **you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered**. You can [check your state’s registration requirements here](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration). In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.

**What do I need to bring with me?**

Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect). **If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.** Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!

**What am I going to be voting on?**

Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can [look up a sample ballot for your area](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.

**I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?**

Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can [learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.](https://www.usa.gov/election-day#item-212487)

**Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?**

Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials ([look up their contact info here](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)). **If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),** [**report it to the admins here**](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request/investigations)**.**

**I have more questions about voting!**

DoSomething.org is back doing a marathon AMA today with their experts in [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) starting at 11am ET to answer all your additional voting questions. Head on over and check it out.

Happy voting, Reddit!

9qxfpa,alienth,"When this post is 1 hour old, reddit will go down for a brief maintenance","Good evening,

Tonight I'll be taking the site down to perform a scheduled maintenance. I'll be shuffling around some internal DNS zones which our services rely upon, and also applying a patch to a db server. While I probably could do this without taking the site down, it is risky enough to merit a brief downtime window.

**The site will go down at 0100 PDT / 0800 UTC**. I expect the downtime to last **up to 10 minutes**.

~The technical details of what I'll be doing~

-----

A long time ago, in a primitive age, three engineers encircling a fire were deciding how to name some servers. Their names were Practical-But-Insufficient, Technically-Correct-But-Wrong, and Pedantic-Argument.

""All servers which we manage should share the same domain name,"" claimed Practical-But-Insufficient, ""for this will eliminate any unnecessary complexity.""

""That will never work,"" retorted Pedantic-Argument, ""for it fails to consider future needs of the infrastructure"". But Pedantic-Argument offered no other solution.

""Servers should all share a base domain,"" suggested Technically-Correct-But-Wrong, ""but we should separate different systems via subdomain."" After some thought, Practical-But-Insufficient nodded in assent. Pedantic-Argument objected to the approach, but offered no other solution, and eventually agreed begrudgingly.

The three engineers presented their compromise to the gods. Upon considering the request, the gods responded:

""Your decision is valid, but... you will regret this,"" the gods declared in a thundering cacophony.

The three engineers were delighted that the naming decision had been made, and went to work on other things.

----

As the gods began building the DNS for the systems, they descended upon the three engineers and asked, ""How shall the DNS zones for the systems be structured?""

Technically-Correct-But-Wrong pondered for a brief moment, then replied, ""It will be simplest to use one zone with the shared domain name for now. We can split them up later if it should be needed.""

The gods smiled, ""Very well.""

----

Ages passed. Systems were born and died. The three engineers grew old, and the years wore heavily upon them.

An engineer of the new age approached the three engineers with a question. ""My realm, like yours, has been built upon the shared domain name. We wish to communicate with you, but we are unable to find your systems.""

The three engineers pondered. They approached the gods.

""We wish for the new realm to have access to our DNS zone,"" asked Practical-But-Insufficient, ""so they might be able to resolve the addresses of our systems.""

A wheezing, cackling voice met the ears of the three engineers, ""But, your zone and the zone from the new realm overlap. What you ask... is impossible.""

""I fucking told you so,"" exclaimed Pedantic-Argument.

9ld746,spez,"You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.","Hello again!

It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&amp;hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to… night mode, user &amp; post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

9jf8nh,landoflobsters,Revamping the Quarantine Function,"While Reddit has had a [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.  

On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine. 

The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.     

Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.  

Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. 

You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits).

This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com) and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.",9226,1538071918,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/,announcements,7519
9ipbun,LastBluejay,It’s US National Voter Registration Day. Are You Registered?,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address. 

Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with [Nonprofit VOTE](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/) to celebrate [National Voter Registration Day](https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/) and help spread the word before the midterms this November.

You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments. 

We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments. 

Also check out the AMAs we have planned for today as well, including:

* A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota in r/politics from 10am-12pm ET
* An AMA about the weird quirks and history of American voting laws with DoSomething.org’s Head of Campaigns in r/IAmA at 11am ET.
* You can also see the [AMA that National Voter Registration Day’s Executive Director](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9ii6uf/im_brian_miller_executive_director_of_national/) did yesterday.

9epjue,arabscarab,MEME DAY: RESURGENCE — The EU Upload Filter Threat Is Back,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ebqyxfgjbgl11...*

Hey Everyone! 

(And a very special *bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,* and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)

It’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet. 

[When we last left you](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/) on July 5 (aka [Meme Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeDay/)), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install [error-prone copyright filters](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwkbad/this-music-theory-professor-just-showed-how-stupid-and-broken-copyright-filters-are) on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.

The July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments, [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) has a [pretty good rundown of them here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/) (note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily). 

The bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi [break down why that is here](https://edri.org/copyright-compulsory-filtering-instead-of-obligatory-filtering-a-compromise/)).

The good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in [A©tion Week](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at [SaveYourInternet.eu](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them. 

Check it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!",2195,1536602901,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9epjue/meme_day_resurgence_the_eu_upload_filter_threat/,announcements,31524
9bvkqa,KeyserSosa,An update on the FireEye report and Reddit,"Last week, FireEye [made an announcement](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html) regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.

* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.
* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.
* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.
* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).

Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:

* 3% (4) had negative karma
* 33% (47) had 0 karma
* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma
* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma
* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma

To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:

* [u/emilyward2017](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilyward2017)
* [u/Homaeefar](https://www.reddit.com/user/Homaeefar)
* [u/alessia\_80s](https://www.reddit.com/user/alessia_80s)
* [u/Anzfp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzfp)
* [u/jeremybernard](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremybernard)
* [u/suarezanton](https://www.reddit.com/user/suarezanton)

Unlike our [last post on foreign interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.

Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.

We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we’ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.",5315,1535736365,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/,announcements,20868
93qnm5,KeyserSosa,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,"**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. 

**What happened?**

On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. 

Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.

Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.

**What information was involved?**

Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:

* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**
   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**
   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. 
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. 

As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.

**What is Reddit doing about it?**

Some highlights. We:

* Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
* Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password. 
* Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)

**What can you do?**

First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.

If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today. 

If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this [help page](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data).

And, as in all things, a strong unique password and [enabling 2FA](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) (which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",7840,1533141992,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/,announcements,73106

Tonight I'll be taking the site down to perform a scheduled maintenance. I'll be shuffling some data from one database group to another in order to make more space for ongoing growth.

Some of you might remember I did a similar maintenance a couple nights ago. What you probably don't know is that that maintenance didn't actually work and I had to urgently revert it. But, as they say, second time's a charm.

We’re constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces, from raising money [for children’s hospitals](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/04/extra-life-kicks-off-november-4th/) to shutting down the “inevitable” SOPA/PIPA. Today, European redditors, along with other concerned EU netizens, helped do the impossible once more. Thanks to the ruckus they raised with their Members of the European Parliament, [the flawed EU Copyright Directive has been sent back to the drawing board](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote), ending (for now) the threats to subject all user uploads to automated content filtering, and require licensing fees for all links. 

There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland [noted](http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliament-rejects-sweeping-internet-copyright-reforms-2018-7) that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote. 

This outpouring of activism about what most people would have considered a dull procedural vote would not have been possible without the awareness and urgency (and, yes, [super-dank memes](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvny8v/some-genius-memers-are-creatively-fighting-the-eus-possible-meme-ban)) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate r/Europe for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) and Europe’s leading [independent experts on copyright reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/), they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out [their tally of the July 5th vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8wblrj/mep_votes_on_the_eu_copyright_directive_by_name/) to see how your MEP voted), and they [used megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8q1mfc/on_the_eu_copyright_reform/) to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help. 

# What’s Next?

This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. 

The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

8sth30,0perspective,Extra! Extra! We're launching a News tab as a beta feature in our iOS app!,"People have come to Reddit for news since the site first launched back in 2005. In the decade-plus since then, you've demonstrated the power communities can have with news — analyzing articles, providing exposure to multiple perspectives, and having millions of discussions that bring context and insight to the conversation. You've shown us that news is an important part of how you use Reddit, but it's gotten harder to only get the news and related discussion, especially if you're subscribed to lots of non-news subreddits or browse [r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular) and [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all). This is why we launched an [alpha](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/8i7q2q/tldr_some_ios_users_will_see_a_news_tab_were/) News tab on our iOS app a few weeks ago. After hearing feedback from mods and iOS users and making a lot of improvements to the design and function of the tab along the way, **today we’re releasing it to the majority of iOS users as a beta**.

# What’s the News tab and how does it work?

*Processing gif 40c0ksw4wd511...*

The News tab offers a home for content that the community surfaces from a group of subreddits that frequently share and engage with the news. When you open the [Reddit iOS app](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download), you'll find it to the left of ""Home"" and ""Popular."" The News tab content is then divided into a handful of common news topics -- like politics, science, and sports -- with options to customize your News tab by selecting the topics or subtopics that interest you most.

We took care to build the News experience around communities that were already engaging with news the most. We have set guidelines for the communities that filter into the experience, as well as the post type (for example: posts titles must reflect the article title). We’ll continue to expand the communities you see in News in Q3. For more on our guidelines, how we’ve been testing and collecting feedback in the News tab alpha on iOS, see our initial [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/8i7q2q/tldr_some_ios_users_will_see_a_news_tab_were/).

# What’s coming next?

So far, we have been testing the News experience in the iOS mobile app. Later this summer, we will be releasing it to desktop. Based on your feedback, we are also working on a few additional features. You told us you wanted more granular news topics (not just Sports but Baseball specifically), so we’ve introduced subtopics for you to personalize your News tab and notifications.   You all told us you want to be able to see how different communities are talking about the same story. So, we are developing a community pivot feature that will show you multiple threads from different communities on the same article.

For those of you with the iOS app, try out News and send your feedback our way by commenting below. We’ll continue to make changes as more redditors test it out. In the meantime, we’ll stick around in the comments below to answer your questions.",2114,1529599906,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8sth30/extra_extra_were_launching_a_news_tab_as_a_beta/,announcements,0
8qfw8l,arabscarab,Protecting the Free and Open Internet: European Edition,"Hey Reddit,

We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet, and we know Redditors do too. Specifically, we’ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now’s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will [vote on changes](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44412025) to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:

* **Article 11** would create a ""link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit. 
* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user\-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.   

The unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe. 

Luckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm. 

Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for [an AMA on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/). In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!

As a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an [easy tool](https://act.openmedia.org/savethelink-call) to help you identify and call your MEP.

Here are some things you’ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP’s office:

* Share your name, location and occupation.
* Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).
* Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?
* Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message—your concern will still be registered.
* Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human. 

Phone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!

And be sure to let us know how it went! Share stories about what your MEP told you in the comments below. 

*PS If you’re an American and don’t want to miss out on the fun, there is still plenty to do on our side of the pond to save the free and open internet.

8m2yr4,KeyserSosa,"We’re updating our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (effective June 8, 2018!)","Hi all,

Today we’re posting updates to our [User Agreement](https://reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Privacy Policy](https://reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) that will become effective June 8, 2018.  For those of you that don’t know me, I’m one of the original engineers of Reddit, [left](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dzl1o/and_like_that_poof_hes_gone/) and then returned in 2016 \(as was the style of the time\), and am currently CTO.  As a [very, very early redditor](https://i.redditmedia.com/Dhv5G_cwJajjHR7je79YL1POdrGa9h0OBd6KDK9X0X8.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=95a3befe0c3af1eaae3681fe39cec348), I know the importance of these issues to the community, so I’ve been working with our Legal team on ensuring that we think about privacy and security in a technical way and continue to make progress \(and are [transparent](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) with all of you\) in how we think about these issues.

To summarize the changes and help explain the “why now?”:

* **Updated for changes to our services.**  It’s [been a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2sk8i9/were_updating_the_reddit_privacy_policy_and_user/) since [our last significant User Agreement update](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/useragreement-2015-01-15.html).  In general, \*these\* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we’re replacing are no longer available \(RIP redditmade and reddit.tv\), we’ve created a more [robust API process](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), and we’ve launched [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/)!
* **European data protection law.**  Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as “Updates to our Privacy Policy” and “Reminder: Important update to our Terms of Service &amp; Privacy Policy.”  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you’ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.
* **Clarity.**  While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise \(like the Copyright, DMCA &amp; Takedown section in the User Agreement\), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy \(e.g., “don’t mess with Reddit” in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on “Breaking Reddit” in the content policy\).

Our work won’t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I’ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we’ve built a [dedicated anti\-evil team](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we’re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we’re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.  We appreciate the work you all have done to [responsibly report security vulnerabilities](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/whitehat) as you find them.

**Note**: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.

I know it can be [difficult to stay on top of](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/8hm7ak/this_visualized_design_shows_you_its_impossible/) all of these Terms of Service updates [\(and what they mean for you\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8euz34/lpt_with_new_privacy_regulations_coming_soon_and/), so we’ll be sticking around to answer questions in the comments.

Then you’ll be happy to hear: Night Mode has \(finally\) landed so you can read Reddit without searing your retinas \(we heard it’s a thing\). 

We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit, and Night Mode has been a top feature request in the r/redesign community, so a few months ago we set out to build it.

...Annnnd now it’s been awhile since we first announced Night Mode was coming. Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough. But our design and engineering teams were undaunted: dive under the hood of the Design &amp; Engineering effort to build Night Mode on the [blog](https://redditblog.com/2018/05/24/night-mode-is-finally-here/).

Today, [the US Senate voted 52\-47](https://www.wired.com/story/senate-approves-measure-to-save-net-neutrality) to restore Net Neutrality! While this measure must now go through the House of Representatives and then the White House in order for the rules to be fully restored, this is still an incredibly important step in that process—one that could not have happened without all your phone calls, emails, and [other activism](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/). The [evidence](http://www.publicconsultation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Net_Neutrality_II_Slides_041818.pdf) is clear that Net Neutrality is important to Americans of both parties \(or no party at all\), and today’s vote demonstrated that our Senators are hearing us.

We’ve still got a way to go, but today’s vote has provided us with some incredible momentum and energy to keep fighting. 

We’re going to keep working with you all on this in the coming months, but for now, we just wanted to say thanks!",6403,1526517171,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/,announcements,192574

Hey Reddit, time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight! 

When we [last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/80jsi9/upvote_the_downvote_tell_congress_to_use_the_cra/) on this in February, we told you about the [Congressional Review Act](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate), which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let’s remind them that we’re watching!

[Today, you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign) in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \(both of ‘em!\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort [here](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/). 

We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in r/politics today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!

Finally, seeing [the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality\-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!

There is strength in numbers, and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big, Reddit\-y hug.

8bb85p,spez,Reddit’s 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings,"Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&amp;#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&amp;#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&amp;#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&amp;#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&amp;#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust &amp; Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It’s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I’ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

891stx,Amg137,"Starting today, more people will have access to the redesign","**TL;DR –** *Today, we’ll begin welcoming a small percentage of users into version 1 of our redesigned desktop site. We still have many improvements &amp; features to ship in the coming weeks, but we’re proud of what we’ve built so far and excited to get it in the hands of more people. And if you don’t like it, you can opt out.*

Our team has been hard at work redesigning our desktop site for more than a year. The main reasons [why we started this project in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) were to allow our engineers to build features faster and to make Reddit more welcoming. It has been a massive undertaking, but we started by [putting users and communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) first—building our designs based on feedback from moderators, longtime users, beta testers, and other redditors every step of the way.

**What’s happening today?**

Today, we’re beginning to give a small group of users access to the desktop redesign at random. We’re starting with a small group to test the load on our servers and plan to make the opt\-in available to everyone in the coming weeks. On behalf of the team, thank you for all of your comments, posts, bug tests, conversations with our designers, creative ideas, and other feedback over the past year. We are very proud of what we have accomplished together and we are excited for you to get [your hands on it](https://i.redd.it/oki81jw2tro01.gif).

Without further ado, and for those who don’t have access yet… here’s what the redesign looks like:

All that said, we know that many of you love Reddit [just the way it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJWM5FmZyqU). If you are one of the lucky few chosen to test out the redesign and prefer the existing Reddit experience, you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top or visit [old.reddit.com](http://reddit.com/). Furthermore, we do not have plans to do away with the current site. We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit ^(we are looking at you i.reddit.com.)

**What’s next?**

As those of you who’ve given us redesign feedback already know, Reddit can be extremely complex. That said, we have not yet rebuilt all of our current features. We’re still iterating on your feedback and building more of the features you love \-\- such as native nightmode and keyboard shortcuts \-\-  plus more new features, which will arrive in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future. We’ve made r/redesign the community dedicated for feedback on the redesign, public to everyone and post weekly updates on our progress there.

We’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer questions.

8830oa,anand-m,And Now a Word from Reddit’s Engineers…,"Hi all,

As you may have heard, we’ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts, [u/Amg137](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amg137) and [u/hueylewisandthesnoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/hueylewisandthesnoos) talked about[ why we're redesigning](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign),[ moderation in the redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded),[ our approach to design](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team), and[ Reddit’s evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit). Today, Reddit’s Engineering team invites you “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s core stack.

Spoiler: There’s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we’ll get through it together.

**History and Journey**

For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit’s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days—a [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \(aka “r2”\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.

Given Reddit’s historically tiny eng team \(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\), our code wasn’t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:

* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): ""For a while now, ‘The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist’ has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.”
* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): ""After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \(unsurprisingly\) part of the code review process is to use ‘git blame’ to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \(one of the more core JS files we had\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‘full stack’ to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \(and depressed\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \(a senior web dev\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.""
* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): “I worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.”

Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team’s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you’ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\), and new features \(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.

Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit’s desktop code to date.

**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**

Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn’t want to outright break.

When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble—with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit’s 330 million monthly users.

But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase ""developer velocity,"" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more ""git blame"" for decade\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.

**The New Tech Stack**

These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:

* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\-related bugs, has good built\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)

**Just the Beginning**

With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We’ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we’ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\). So far, we’ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of \~20 features and 200\+ bugs per month.

We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items \(like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts\), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign—and because of our engineers’ work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.

Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish—we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn’t want to use it.

[Thank you](https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif) to everyone who’s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.

863xcj,Reddit-Policy,New addition to site-wide rules regarding the use of Reddit to conduct transactions,"Hello All—

We want to let you know that we have made a new addition to our [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) forbidding transactions for certain goods and services. As of today, users may not use Reddit to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services, including:

* Firearms, ammunition, or explosives;
* Drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances \(except advertisements placed in accordance with our advertising policy\);
* Paid services involving physical sexual contact;
* Stolen goods;
* Personal information;
* Falsified official documents or currency

When considering a gift or transaction of goods or services not prohibited by this policy, keep in mind that **Reddit is not intended to be used as a marketplace and takes no responsibility for any transactions individual users might decide to undertake in spite of this**. Always remember: you are dealing with strangers on the internet.

EDIT: Thanks for the questions everyone. We're signing off for now but may drop back in later. We know this represents a change and we're going to do our best to help folks understand what this means.

84nyj6,Amg137,A short-ish history of new features on Reddit,"Hi all,

Over the past few months, we’ve talked a lot about our desktop redesign—[why we’re doing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/), [moderation/styling tools we’re adding](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/), and, most recently, [how you all have shaped our designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/). Today, we’re going to try something a little different. We’d like to take all of you on a field trip, [to the Museum of Reddit](https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png)!

When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past \(on Reddit [and other sites](http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png)\). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.

**Trippin’ Through Time**

When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny’s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit’s front page [looked like this](https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg&amp;s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456).

In the site’s early days, [u/spez](/user/spez) and [u/kn0thing](/user/kn0thing) played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests [by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks](http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html), and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned\-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/).

As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. \(Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...\)

They launched commenting. \(The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).\) They recoded the entire site [from Lisp to Python](https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg&amp;s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217). They added [limits on the lengths of post titles](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/z9yk/reddit_headlines_have_been_getting_longer_and/). And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit’s biggest change to date: [user\-created subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/).

It’s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it [wasn’t without controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/). In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and [argued](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/) [passionately](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/) [against](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/) [subreddits](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/). \(Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched [our first desktop redesign](https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/), which received its share of [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/), [bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/), and [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/) reviews.\)

During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in\-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user\-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a [cumbersome URL trick](https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/) people used to make multireddits into [a supported feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/).

That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we’ve built in the years since then, like [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) \(my first project as an admin\), [video hosting](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/), [mobile apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/), [mobile mod tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/), [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/), [live threads](https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/), [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/), and [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/), to name a few.

**What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!**

Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:

* You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.
* The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.

With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third\-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like [set post requirements](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif) and [take bulk actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif) more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback \(more on that in our next blog post about engineering!\).

**Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts**

One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!

Like anything we’ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we’re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.

In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. \(Thank you to everyone who’s given feedback so far!\) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think.

827zqc,spez,"In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I’d like to share our thinking.","In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it’s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, we’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don’t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015–2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOP’s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It’s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues. It’s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we’re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know it’s frustrating that we don’t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries.

Today, I’m here as a hu~~man sacrifice m~~ember of Reddit’s Design team \(surprise: designers actually work at Reddit!\) to talk about how we’ve approached the desktop redesign and what we’ve learned from your feedback along the way.

When approaching the redesign, we all learned early on that this wasn’t just about making Reddit more usable, accessible, and efficient; it was also about learning how to interact, adapt, and communicate with the world’s largest, most passionate and genuine community of users.

# Better every (feedback) loop

Every team working on this project has its share of longtime redditors—whether it's Product, Design, Engineering, or Community. To say that this has been the most challenging \(and rewarding\) project of our careers is an understatement. Over the past year we’ve been running surveys internally and externally. We’ve conducted video conferences with first\-time users, redditors on their 10th Cake Day, moderators, and lurkers. Not to mention an extremely helpful community of alpha testers. You all have shaped the way we do every part of our jobs, from brainstorming and creating designs to building features and collecting feedback.

Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality, you came in and told us where we were wrong and, in most cases, explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you—like [making Classic and Compact views fill your screen](https://media1.tenor.com/images/782ba18e2ff1bb49a36ade1ab90f2869/tenor.gif?itemid=7549364) \(coming soon\).

# What? Reddit is evolving!

Reddit is not a one\-size\-fits\-all experience. It’s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:

* Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit
   * [Give communities tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) that are simple, intuitive, and flexible—for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.
* Make our desktop experience more welcoming
   * Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice \(e.g., different viewing options: [Card](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) / [Classic](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) / [Compact](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif)\) and familiarity to all users.
* Design a foundation for the future
   * Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.
* Keep content at the forefront
   * We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.

# Asking Reddit

As we moved from setting high\-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look\-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It’s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:

* Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a “hamburger menu” on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and [filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters](https://i.redd.it/1is6htgra3j01.gif).
* Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts \(aka “Create a post”\) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you’re creating.
* Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We’ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved \(e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic\), and we’re working on shipping fixes.

The list of user\-inspired changes goes on and on \(and we’re expecting a lot more *i*teration as we expand our testing pool\), but this is how we’ve worked through design challenges so far.

# It’s [never over](https://media.giphy.com/media/fQvND2Wo28q9a/giphy.gif)

The redesign isn’t finished at “GA” \(General Availability, or as I like to call it, “Time to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work”\). With this post, we wanted to share some context on our approach, thank everyone who's participated in r/redesign so far \(THANK YOU!\), and let you know we will continue to engage with you on a daily basis to understand how you’re responding to what we’re building.

Over the next several weeks, we'll be expanding the number of users who have access to the alpha \(yes, you will be able to opt out if you prefer the current desktop look\), hearing what you think, and updating all of you as we make more changes. In the meantime, I'll be sticking around in the comments for a bit to answer questions and [invite all of you to listen to Huey Lewis with me](https://youtu.be/J08ZwySCoJ8?t=84).

EDIT: Thank you for all your comments, feedback, and suggestions so far. I gotta get back to the whole working\-on\-the\-redesign thing, but I’ll be jumping back into the comments when I can over the rest of the day.",2411,1519929846,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/,announcements,18872
80jsi9,arabscarab,Upvote the Downvote: Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality!,"Hey, Reddit! 

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. 

The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one. 

“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**

# What is it?

The Congressional Review Act \(CRA\) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).

# What’s happening in Congress?

Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! 

# What should I do?

Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.

If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”

# Pro tips:

\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. 

\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).

\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.

\-**Don’t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",5223,1519707605,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/80jsi9/upvote_the_downvote_tell_congress_to_use_the_cra/,announcements,142146

7xjt6g,Amg137,Because it’s Valentine’s Day… here’s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!,"Hi All,

Two weeks ago, we [kicked off our blog series](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.

Fun fact: When Reddit first launched, user\-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.

Without further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.

# Features inspired by the community

[**Image Flair - Emojis**](https://i.redditmedia.com/Tk7MR1_C8WtRpgrtnQfM4qziSIsS7q5S1lirkhcMlZo.png?s=048534b6d6837c5a0d2c708b34d2fe3f)

Giving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like [r/baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball)'s team logo flair and [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW)'s faction icons. To make this process simpler, we’re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.

[**Submit Validation**](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif)

Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren’t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.

[**Flair Filtering**](https://i.redditmedia.com/ERuv8BBJBhRL28_cexQVDulJ2q2djLR9tiSCoLmC7iw.png?s=22b5edba1b74e4e1ef604057907f7509)

Many subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities. [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting, [r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop) uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we’ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.

**Sidebar**

Many mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of [r/WholesomeMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeMemes) to [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA)'s schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes [text widgets](https://i.redd.it/7u6ttrufr6g01.png), [button widgets](https://i.redd.it/117hrvjx6af01.png), [image widgets](https://i.redd.it/uhg3r378s6g01.png), [a calendar widget](https://i.redd.it/t2l2jrhy6af01.png), [a related communities widget](https://i.redd.it/8kfygo3y6af01.png), and [a rules widget](https://i.redd.it/grx7kklsr6g01.png). But we’re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.

# Features inspired by 3rd-party tools

Communities themselves aren’t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd\-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite \(RES\).

**Toolbox:** [**Bulk Mod Actions**](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif)

Moderating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third\-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You’ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.

**RES:** [**Show All Images \(aka Card View\)**](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif)

RES has enhanced Reddit’s expandos \(i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs\) for years, and one of the most popular features has been “show all images” \(i.e., expand all the things!\). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post’s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.

**RES:** [**User Info Cards** **\(inline banning/muting\)**](https://i.redd.it/q070hj0yv6g01.gif)

When cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they’ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user’s stats \(like account age and karma score\) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio—plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.

**Toolbox:** [**Removal Reasons**](https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif)

Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox\-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we’re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. \(Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.\)

**Styling**

Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. [Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn’t work on mobile.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif) With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. \(But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.\)

With these new features, we're excited to say that [styling a community is much easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/). Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like [r/AskReddit](https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png), [r/CasualConversation](https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png), [r/Greenday](https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png), [r/ITookAPicture](https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png), and [r/NASCAR](https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png). We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.

**Join the Redesign!**

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews).",1955,1518630409,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/,announcements,7712
7vxzrb,landoflobsters,Update on site-wide rules regarding involuntary pornography and the sexualization of minors,"Hello All--

These policies were previously combined in a single rule; they will now be broken out into two distinct ones.

As we have said in past communications with you all, we want to make Reddit a more welcoming environment for all users. We will continue to review and update our policies as necessary.

We’ll hang around in the comments to answer any questions you might have about the updated rules.

Edit: Thanks for your questions! Signing off now. ",12843,1518026503,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7vxzrb/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_involuntary/,announcements,25270
7u2zpi,spez,"Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion","Hello again,

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&amp;S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I’m serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

7spq3s,StringerBell5,Protect your account with two-factor authentication!,"You asked for it, and we’re delivering! Today, all Reddit users have the option to enable [two-factor authentication](https://i.redd.it/2y66bw0sapb01.gif) for an additional layer of account security.

We have been [slowly rolling this feature out](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7bfoqg/twofactor_authentication_now_available_for/), starting with beta testers, moderators, and third-party app developers, to ensure a positive experience across devices. Your feedback has been incredibly valuable, from pointing out bugs to recommending features. Thank you to everyone involved in testing.

Two-factor adds more security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. In this case, if you opt into 2FA, you’ll access a 6-digit verification code generated by your phone after a new sign-in attempt.

With two-factor enabled, even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you.

You can enable two-factor by selecting the [password/email](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/) tab under your preferences on desktop. Select **enable** under _two-factor authentication_ and follow the steps given to you. And make sure to generate your backup codes in the event your phone is unavailable! You can find more help in our [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication).

Two-factor is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party apps. It requires an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or any app supporting the TOTP protocol) to generate your 6-digit verification code.

A few handy security reminders:

* Choose a strong and unique password. We recommend at least 8 characters. And don’t reuse the same password on Reddit as other sites!
* Add a verified email address. Email is the only way for us to reset your account. (We do require a verified email for setting up two-factor authentication since the account can be lost if, for example, you lose your phone).
* Check your [account activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) for recent logins. It’s a good idea to look at this page from time to time to make sure there’s nothing fishy going on.

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&amp;utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

7a4bjo,spez,"Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.","Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

6qptzw,spez,"With so much going on in the world, I thought I’d share some Reddit updates to distract you all","Hi All,

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We’re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust &amp; Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

6eh6ga,simbawulf,Reddit's new signup experience,"Hi folks,
 
**TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.**

 
Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.  

Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched r/popular as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results. 
 

New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick [tutorial page](https://i.redd.it/77yt9bbojv0z.png) on how to subscribe to communities.

On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding [in-line subscription buttons](https://i.redd.it/ccdmg3aujv0z.png) that show up next to communities you’re not subscribed to.


To the communities formerly known as defaults - thank you.  You were, and will continue to be, awesome. To our new users - we’re excited to show you the breadth and depth our communities!
 
Thanks,

63974m,spez,It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.,"Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit’s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook’s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (“Knight”) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court’s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230’s immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

I’ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can’t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Steve (spez)

60p3n1,HideHideHidden,TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile,"Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You’ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We’re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour’s new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he’s doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for “shitty_watercolour”, “kn0thing”, “leagueoflegends” and you’ll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we’re starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our “friends” feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What’s next?
* We’re taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit’s existing communities, which is why we’re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We’ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We’re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They’ll be able to post to their profile and you’ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&amp;A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (“alpha”) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we’re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There’s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that’s ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We’re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere — therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can’t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We’re also testing a new feature called “Active in these Communities” on the tester’s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we’re being so careful about how we’re testing this feature — we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what’s the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing “friends” feature?**

A: We’re not making any changes to the existing “friends” feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don’t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I’m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you’re wrong?**

A: We don’t have all of the answers right now and that’s why we’re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we’re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won’t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We’ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We’re also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l).

5u9pl5,simbawulf,Introducing r/popular,"Hi folks!

Back in the day, the original version of the front page looked an awful lot like r/all.  In fact, it *was* r/all.  But, when we first released the ability for users to [create subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/03/12/make-your-own-reddit/), those new, nascent communities had trouble competing with the larger, more established subreddits which dominated the top of the front page.  To mitigate this effect, we created the notion of the defaults, in which we *cherry picked* a set of subreddits to appear as a default set, which had the effect of editorializing Reddit. 

Over the years, Reddit has grown up, with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities, each with enormous reach and great content. Consequently, the “defaults” have received a disproportionate amount of traffic, and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit. We, therefore, are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching r/popular, which, like r/all, opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page. 

**Logged out users will land on “popular” by default and see a large source of diverse content.  
Existing logged in users will still maintain their subscriptions.**

##How are posts eligible to show up “popular”?
First, a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place. 
Post from the following types of communities will not show up on “popular”:  

* NSFW and 18+ communities
* Communities that have opted out of r/all
* A handful of subreddits that users [consistently filter](https://i.redd.it/vxybnlltm2gy.gif) out of their r/all page
  

##What will this change for logged in users?
Nothing! Your frontpage is still made up of your subscriptions, and you can still access r/all. If you sign up today, you will still see the 50 defaults. We are working on making that transition experience smoother. If you are interested in checking out r/popular, you can do so by clicking on the link on the gray nav bar the top of your page, right between “FRONT” and “ALL”. 
  

**TL;DR:** We’ve created a new page called “popular” that will be the default experience for logged out users, to provide those users with better, more diverse content. 
  

Thanks, we hope you enjoy this new feature!

5q4qmg,spez,"Out with 2016, in with 2017","Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago—especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven’t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust &amp; Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

5or86n,powerlanguage,Spoilers tags for posts!,"**TL;DR:** We’ve launched spoiler tags for posts.  This allows spoilers to be clearly identified in any community on any platform.

Reddit is a great place to discuss the things you love.  And right now the culture industry is working overtime to pump out oodles of the things you love.  Whatever these passions, you can find a community on Reddit that is as excited about them as you are.  That could be:

- Discussing the [r/StarWars](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/) universe at length 
- Following Worlds in [r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/) 
- Ruminating on the whereabouts of Gendry in r/gameofthrones
- Watching [the showrunner get involved](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5d0zee/the_real_question_no_one_is_asking/da1zzsl) in the fan theorizing on [r/westworld](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/) 
- Getting excited about the long awaited Japanese release of [r/KingdomHearts](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/) 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue 
- Speculating on the upcoming season of [r/twinpeaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/) 

However, you might want to participate in a community where you aren’t up-to-date on the latest happenings.  Enter spoiler tags (an [oft-requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/search?q=spoiler&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) feature).  

OP can now mark their post as a spoiler — this will add a tag to the post that clearly identifies it containing spoilers and pixilate the preview image if there is one.  Other users can then decide whether or not they want to view the post.

Spoiler tags are supported on the desktop site, mobile web and the official iOS and Android apps:

- [Spoiler post on desktop](https://i.redd.it/me0kodw5iiay.png) 
- [Spoiler post on mobile web](https://i.redd.it/q9rfsqg7iiay.png) 
- [Spoiler post in the official iOS/Android apps](https://i.redd.it/jzjrp5x8iiay.png) - **[Download the official Reddit app](https://reddit.app.link/iX69PNtG2z)**

To see what spoilers look like in a safe, spoiler-free environment, we’ve created some sample spoiler posts in r/powerlanguagetest for you to peruse.

If you want full details about how to mark a post as a spoiler, or if you are a mod wondering about the implications for your community check out the [r/changelog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) and the r/modnews post.

And finally, a big thank you to [all the subreddits that helped us test this feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/).

5gvd6b,KeyserSosa,Scores on posts are about to start going up,"In the 11 years that Reddit has been around, we've accumulated [a lot of rules](https://i.redd.it/oek2mm1io01y.png) in our vote tallying as a way to mitigate cheating and brigading on posts and comments.   [Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.   


**TL;DR** voting is confusing, we cleaned up some outdated rules on voting, and we’re updating the vote scores to be reflective of what they actually are. Scores are increasing by a lot. 

**Edit**: The scores just updated.  Everyone should now see ""k""s.  Remember: it's going to take about a week for top listings to recompute to reflect the change.

5frg1n,spez,TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.,"**tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&amp;sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

Steve

PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&amp;fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I’m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.

59k22p,spez,"Hey, it’s Reddit’s totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.","Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x…) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics’. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

As such, beginning today r/baseball will temporarily be added as a default community to users in the US and Canada for the remainder of the fall classic, which is expected to end by early November at the latest.

What does being a default community entail, you ask?

This means posts from r/baseball will begin to appear on the front page for these users through the end of the World Series.

4y0m56,gooeyblob,Why Reddit was down on Aug 11,"**tl;dr**

On Thursday, August 11, Reddit was down and unreachable across all platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.

Thank you all for contributions to r/downtimebananas.

**Impact**

On Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system. 

No data was lost.

**Cause and Remedy**

We use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. 

Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.

At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to “down mode” while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally. 

**Prevention**

As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations.

* Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
* Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations.
* Properly disable package management systems during migrations so they don’t affect systems unexpectedly.

**Last Thoughts**

We take downtime seriously, and are sorry for any inconvenience that we caused. The silver lining is that in the process of restoring our systems, we completed a big milestone in our operations modernization that will help make development a lot faster and easier at Reddit.",3389,1471367551,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4y0m56/why_reddit_was_down_on_aug_11/,announcements,4435
4x35a3,spez,Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.,"I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, we’ve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we’re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we’re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We’ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we’d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We’re still in the early days, but I’m happy we’re dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we’ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We’ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust &amp; Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

4upf11,starfishjenga,New Ad Type: Promoted User Posts,"**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**

Hi all,
 
We’ve been working on some new ad products. When we’re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we’re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.
 
In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.
 
The solution, which we’re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we’re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. 

How it works:

* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content
* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they’re interested in promoting the post
* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post
* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)
* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**

For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)

Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We’ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.

While we’re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we’ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We’ve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.

Thanks for reading, and happy redditing!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**FAQ**

**Q: I don’t want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**
No content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter’s explicit permission. If you don’t want this to happen, either don’t answer or say no when you’re asked.

**Q: What does the promoted by link point to?**
If a brand pays to promote a post, in the bottom right corner where it says ""promoted by"", the advertiser will be linked so that you will know who is promoting the post. Clicking on their name will link to an advertiser-determined location. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What if my content was originally intended to point somewhere else? Do advertisers have the right to change that? Wouldn’t this change the context of the pre-existing comments?**
Your content won’t be used in this way unless you agree to let it become a promoted user post.

If you’ve commented on a post that becomes a promoted user post, promoted user posts will simply create an additional link to these comments pages. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What happens to the original votes? Is this a way for companies to juice the number of upvotes to their posts?**
The vote count from the original post will be copied to the promoted post, but any upvotes applied to the promoted post will not be copied back to the original post in order to preserve the integrity of the ranking algorithm.

**Q: What happens to the original post?**
The original post still remains where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Q: What does the link in the promoted post point to?**
Promoting a post does not change the destination of the original link. If it was a self post, it goes to the self post comments page. If it was a link post, it goes to the link destination, same as before. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png)

**Q: Is there a way for us to view where our content was promoted?**
If your content is chosen for promotion and you accept, we’ll give you a link to the promoted user post.

**Q: Do we get anything in return for agreeing to have our post promoted?**
This may vary across content and across time as we figure out what makes the most sense. It will generally take the form of Gold membership for some amount of time.

**Q: Won’t this encourage more users to submit content containing brands (and more fuss from /r/HailCorporate over “shilling”)?**
We don’t believe the rewards on offer are enough to change people’s behavior in this case, but we’ll keep an eye on it and deal with any problems that arise.

EDIT 2: I'm back early because there's some confusion around what this is. Please see link at the top which I'll be updating with a more clear example.

4tmb16,powerlanguage,Karma for text-posts (AKA self-posts),"As most of you already know, fictional internet points are probably the most precious resource in the world.  On Reddit we call these points Karma.  You get Karma when content you post to Reddit receives upvotes.  Your Karma is displayed on [your userpage](http://reddit.com/u/me).

You may also know that you can submit different types of posts to Reddit.  One of these post types is a text-post (e.g. this thing you’re reading right now is a text-post).  Due to [various shenanigans and low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) we stopped giving Karma for text-posts over 8 years ago.

However, over time the usage of text-posts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit.  Who could forget such classics as:

- [Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/) - from r/starwars 
- [What tasty food would be disgusting if eaten over rice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/) - from r/askreddit 
- [You people make me sick [a grilled cheese meltdown]](https://np.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/2or1p3/you_people_make_me_sick/) - from r/grilledcheese 

Text-posts make up over 65% of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept text-posts. Because of this Reddit has become known for thought-provoking, witty, and in-depth text-posts, and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys.

To acknowledge this, from this day forward we will now be giving users karma for text-posts. This will be combined with link karma and presented as ‘post karma’ on [userpages](http://reddit.com/u/me).

TL:DR; We used to not give you karma for your text-posts.  We do now.  Sweet.

4phzsi,starfishjenga,Sponsored headline tests: placement and design,"Hi everyone,

We’re going to be launching a test on Monday, June 27 to get a better understanding of the costs and benefits of putting sponsored headlines inside the content feed vs. at the top. We believe that this will help Reddit move closer to becoming a long-term sustainable business with an average small to zero negative impact to the user experience.

Specifically, users who are (randomly) selected to be part of the test group will see a redesigned version of the sponsored headline moving between positions 1-6 in the content feed on desktop. You can see examples of a couple design variants [here](http://i.imgur.com/W2zUlcS.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/GppJVkh.jpg) (we may introduce new test variants as we gather more data). We tried to strike a balance with ads that are clearly labeled but not too loud or obnoxious.

We will be monitoring a couple of things. Do we see higher ad engagement when the ads are not pinned to the top of the page? Do we see higher content engagement when the top link is not an ad?

As usual, feedback on this change is welcome. I’ll be reading your comments and will respond to as many as I can.

Thanks for reading!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**EDIT 1:** Hide functionality will still be available for these new formats. The reason it doesn't show up in the screenshots is because those were taken in a logged out state. Sorry for the confusion!

**EDIT 2:** Based on feedback in this thread, we're including a variant with more obvious background coloring and sponsored callout. You can see the new design [here](https://i.redd.it/1mef0qvpl35x.png) (now with Reddit image hosting! :D).

**FAQ**

What will you do if the test is successful?
*If the test is successful, we’ll roll this out to all users.*

What determines if the test is successful?
*We’ll be considering both qualitative user feedback as well as measurable user behavior (engagement, ad engagement data, etc). We’re looking for an uptick in ad interaction (bringing more value to advertisers) as well as overall user engagement with content.*

I hate ads / you shouldn’t be doing this / you’re all terrible moneygrabbers!
*We’re doing our best to do this in the least disruptive way possible, and we’ll be taking your feedback into account through this test to make sure we can balance the needs and desires of the community and becoming a sustainable business.*

What platforms does this affect?
*Just the desktop website for now.*

Does this impact 3rd party apps?
*Not at this time. We’ll speak with our developer community before making any potential changes there.*

How long will the test run for?
*The test will run for at least 4 weeks, possibly longer.*",1180,1466703640,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/,announcements,0

4oedco,spez,Let’s all have a town hall about r/all,"Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

4ny59k,spez,Let's talk about Orlando,"Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let’s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news’ policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We–Reddit Inc, moderators, and users–all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We’ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time.

4nc81l,Amg137,New look on Reddit mobile web: compact view,"**TL;DR:** Mobile web users will be redirected to a new compact view on m.reddit.com starting today

**Hi everyone!**
Over the past few months, we have worked hard to improve the Reddit experience on mobile devices with the launch of native mobile apps and a new mobile web experience. We launched a mobile web beta a little while back and thanks to the community involved, we were able to make improvements for an official launch today. Starting today, users on mobile web will be directed to m.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com.  

**Easy way to opt out:**
If you prefer to stick with www.reddit.com, there is a very easy way to opt out. All you have to do is click the menu button in the top right corner and select ‘Desktop Site’. The next time you come back, you will be served the desktop site by default. [Here](https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif) is a short gif that demonstrates how to opt out.

**What’s next?**
Please give it a try and post any feedback you have — we'd love to hear how we can make it better. This is just the beginning of making the mobile web experience as seamless as possible for all of you.

4mv578,starfishjenga,Affiliate links on Reddit,"Hi everyone,

Today we’re launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won’t be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled “replace all affiliate links”.

The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We’ve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.

We’re structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it’s worth our time. It’s important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.

Thanks for your support.

Cheers,
u/starfishjenga

Some FAQs:

**Will this work with my adblocker?**
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.

**Are the outgoing links HTTPS?**
Yes.

**Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?**
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.

**Can I switch this off for my subreddit?**
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.

**Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?**
~~Yes, this will be completed shortly.~~ This is available [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?** When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?** If I post a link to [a storm trooper necklace](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-Storm-Trooper-3D-Necklace/111817866493?_trksid=p2047675.c100009.m1982&amp;_trkparms=aid%3D777000%26algo%3DABA.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131227121020%26meid%3Daa3df26a727e4999b28c34077939ff19%26pid%3D100009%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D112015566756) and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.

**EDIT 3** We've added some questions about this feature to the [FAQ](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT 4** For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out *provided you have changed the user setting*. This will go live later today.

**EDIT 5** The user preference has been added for *all* users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled ""replace affiliate links"" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 3): Can I get an ELI5?** When you click on a link to some (~5k) online stores, Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase. If you don't like this, you can opt out via the user preference labeled ""replace affiliate links"".

**EDIT (additional FAQ 4): The name of the user preference is confusing, can you change it?** Feedback taken, thanks. The preference will be changed to ""change links into Reddit affiliate links"". I'll update the text above when the change rolls out. Thanks!

**EDIT (additional FAQ 5): What will happen to existing affiliate links?** This won't interfere with existing affiliate links.",2932,1465245570,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/,announcements,2884

4l60nc,KeyserSosa,"Reddit, account security, and YOU!","If you haven't seen it in the news, there have been [a lot](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-passwords-idUSKCN0XV1I6) of [recent password dumps](http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/05/then-there-were-117-million-linkedin-password-breach-much-bigger-than-thought/) made available on the parts of the internet most of us generally avoid.  With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.  

Though Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are *reusing passwords between sites*.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:

 * Choose a [strong, **unique** password](https://xkcd.com/936/).  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean ""use that really good password you use on sites you care about.""  I mean [""one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!""](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/)   [Password reuse is really bad!](https://xkcd.com/792/)  We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that *other* site you use the same password on who decides not to use [bcrypt](https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) but rather a [nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!](https://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/)
 * [Set and verify an email address](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.
 * [Check your own account activity page!](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity)  If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to [change your password](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.

On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in *for several years*.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password ""hunter2"". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!

---

**Q**: *But how do I make a unique password?*

**A**: Personally I'm a big fan of tools like [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) because they generate completely random passwords.  There are also some well-known [heuristics](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2008/11/passwords_are_not_br.html).  [Note: lmk of your favorites here and I'll edit in a plug.]

**Q**: *What's with the fear mongering??*

**A**: [It's been a rough month.](https://i.redd.it/ua725p02cizw.jpg) Also, [don't just take it from me this is important.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc)

**Q**: *Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?*

**A**: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if *we* get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  

Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a [huge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&amp;hl=en) [ecosystem](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8) [of](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader&amp;hl=en) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8), including our newly released [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&amp;hl=en) clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  ""Adding 2FA to the login flow"" will require a lot of coordination.

**Q**: *Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!*

**A**: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know [who the enemy is](/user/me) and [why!](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/)

**Q**: *Do you realize you linked to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/ like three times?*

**A**: Actually it was four.

I’m Alex Le–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What’s New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&amp;publisher_id=294177&amp;site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&amp;publisher_id=294177&amp;site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.

### What’s Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!  
Alex

**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team – we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day. I will keep reading top comments but will be replying less now. ",6631,1460034278,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/,announcements,4750
4dmnn6,KeyserSosa,"New and improved ""block user"" feature in your inbox.","Reddit is a place where virtually anyone can voice, [ask about](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit) or [change their views on a wide range of topics](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview), share [personal, intimate feelings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Avocadosgonewild), or [post cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsStandingUp/) [pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/316cats). This leads to great communities and deep meaningful discussions.  But, sometimes this very openness can lead to less awesome stuff like spam, trolling, and worse, harassment.  We work hard to deal with these when they occur publicly.  Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve just released a feature to help you filter them from within your own inbox: user blocking.

Believe it or not, we’ve actually had a [""block user"" feature](http://i.imgur.com/Tszb0YJ.png) in a basic form for [quite a while](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/4d7a2fa4e0f01f7010e0f7fd0317cb783cda54c1), though over time its utility focused to apply to only private messages.  [We’ve recently updated](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/6c9a28e6bd0cebc05e220b6d807b4bf46663474b) its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the “Block User” button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.  You will no longer be alerted if they message you further.  As before, the block is [completely silent to the blocked user](http://i.imgur.com/GUIBD9t.png).  Blocks can be viewed or removed on [your preferences page here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked/).

Our changes to user blocking are intended to let you decide what your boundaries are, and to give you the option to *choose* what you want—or don’t want—to be exposed to. [And, of course, you can and should still always *report* harassment to our community team!]

These are just our first steps toward improving the experience of using Reddit, and we’re looking forward to announcing many more.",3143,1459962013,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/,announcements,4941
4cqyia,spez,"For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report","In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we’ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn’t easy as a small company as we don’t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, we’ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.

In addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. 

We are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. 

We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

(I'll do my best to answer questions, but as with all legal matters, I can't always be completely candid.)

edit: I'm off for now. There are a few questions that I'll try to answer after I get clarification.

4ch0pv,powerlanguage,Updates to our media previews,"#What is a media preview?

On Reddit, a media preview is an image, video, or gallery in a **link post** that can be expanded with a button and viewed directly on listings and comments pages without having to leave Reddit.  Right now, we have media previews for certain types of videos, image galleries and sound files.  Media previews are controlled by [buttons that look like this](http://i.imgur.com/epKvK2w.png).

#That’s wonderful, but what have you actually changed?

**Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages**

By default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.  [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png).  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.

**New Media Preferences**

You can control how media previews display on your screen with [new preferences](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) available on your [preferences page](http://reddit.com/prefs).  

**Media previews support more file types**

We’ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.  Put simply, if you submit a link post to to Reddit with a URL that ends in `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., that media will be expandable.  Put even simply-er, more content on Reddit will have a preview available.

**NSFW Flows**

Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages, we’ve also added an[ optional screen to block NSFW media](http://i.imgur.com/bdCCAat.gifv). This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media.

**TL;DR:**

- [Media previews auto-expand on comments pages](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png) 
- [New user preferences to control media previews](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) 
- More media previews!

434h6c,spez,Reddit in 2016,"Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

–Steve

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring.

3tlcil,spez,"We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)","In a little over a month we’ll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

3sbrro,powerlanguage,Account suspensions: A transparent alternative to shadowbans,"Today we’re rolling out a new type of account restriction called suspensions.  Suspensions will replace [shadowbans](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/) for the vast majority of real humans and increase transparency when handling users who violate [Reddit’s content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

## How it works

* Suspensions can only be applied to accounts by the Reddit admins (not moderators).
* Suspended accounts will always receive a notification about the suspension including reason and the duration:
    * [See example notification PM](http://i.imgur.com/wQJrnGR.png) - Sent to user account from r/reddit.com 
    * [See example on-page notification](http://i.imgur.com/yzzSXEU.png) - Shown on pages while an account is suspended 
* Suspended users can reply to the notification PM to appeal their suspension 
* Suspensions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of infraction and the user’s previous infractions. 

## What it does to an account

Suspended users effectively have their account put into read-only mode.  The primary actions they will not be able to perform are:

- Voting 
- Submitting posts 
- Commenting 
- Sending private messages 
  
Moderators who have been suspended will not be able to perform any mod actions or access modmail while the suspension is in effect.

You can see [the full list of forbidden actions for suspended users here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686).

Users in both temporary and permanent suspensions will always be able to delete/edit their posts and comments as usual.

Users browsing on a desktop version of the site will see a [pop-up notice](http://i.imgur.com/4uBMcu2.png) or [notification page](http://i.imgur.com/eyvYgt5.png) anytime they try and perform an action they are forbidden from doing.  App users will receive an error depending on how each app developer chooses to indicate the status of suspended accounts.

## User pages

* Visiting the user page of an account that has been permanently suspended will [indicate that the account has been suspended](http://i.imgur.com/eXIlh9i.png) and will not display any other data.
* Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended.
* In addition to this, we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly [display that the account in question was deleted by the user](http://i.imgur.com/bfTfhxs.png). 

## Why this is a good thing

Our current form of account restriction, [the shadowban](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/), is great for dealing with bots/spam rings but woefully inadequate for real human beings.  We think suspensions are a vast improvement.

* Suspensions inform people when they’ve broken the rules.  While this seems like a no-brainer, this helps so we can identify the specific behavior that caused the suspension.
* Users are given a chance to correct their behavior.  We’re all human and we all make mistakes.  Reddit believes in the goodness of people.  We think most people won’t intentionally continue to violate a rule after being notified.
* Suspensions can vary in length depending on the severity of the infraction and user’s history.  This allows flexibility when applying suspensions. Different types of infraction can have different responses.
* Increased transparency.  We want to be upfront about suspending user accounts to both the user being suspended and other users (where appropriate).

I’ve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there’s lots to do here… who knew?).

Here’s a few updates:

* I’m still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2’s legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely ""super highest priority"".

Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

A little about myself:

* I’m [incredibly photogenic](http://imgur.com/4mZR3Jt)
* I love building.  Love VLSI, analog/digital circuitry, microarchitecture, assembly, OS design, network design, VM/JIT, distributed systems, ios/android/web, 3d modeling/animation/rendering.  Recently got into 3d printing - fucking LOVE it.  My 3d printer enables me to make nearly anything and have it materialize on my desk in a few hours. 
* I love people.  When I first became a manager, I discovered how amazing the human mind really is and endeavoured to learn everything I can.  I love studying the relationship between our limbic and rational selves, how communication breaks down, what motivates people / teams, and how to build amazing cultures.  I’m currently learning everything I can about what constitutes a strong company culture and trying to make the discussion of culture more rigorous than it currently is in the valley.
* My current non-Reddit projects are making a grocery list iOS app that’s super simple and just does the right thing (trying out App Engine for backend).  And the other is making this full size fully functional [thing](http://imgur.com/A41GI6o).

I’m suuuuper excited to be here!  I don’t know much at all yet (I’ve been an official employee for… 7 hours?), but I plan to do an AMA in 30 days (Sept 20ish) once I know a lot more.

3fx2au,spez,Content Policy Update,"Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.",19368,1438805878,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/,announcements,974

I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community.

A large part of my role as Head of Community was reflected behind the scenes (policy, community regulation etc.) and the community team is much more interactive than I on a daily basis so very little will change after my departure. Media outlets are suggesting that the circumstances around my departure are different than they are in reality so I'd like to clear this up as I don't like being misrepresented. Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause.

That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them. At the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family.

It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now. 


So what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.

Lucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When /u/spez asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of, /u/krispykrackers. Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community. A redditor since 2008, employed by reddit for five years, and a community manager for over a year, she has been a very important part of our daily community interactions and is so dedicated to her work that I'm not sure she even sleeps!

I'm very confident that krispy and spez, along with the rest of reddit, will guide the community to the best state it has ever been in and I am excited to see the future of reddit unfold with their leadership.

3f10up,spez,"Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.","I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!",10072,1438177826,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3f10up/good_morning_i_thought_id_give_a_quick_update/,announcements,3010
3djjxw,spez,Let's talk content. AMA.,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of ""harm""
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

update: I'm out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I'll check back later.",22569,1437076815,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/,announcements,2181
3dautm,spez,"Content Policy update. AMA Thursday, July 16th, 1pm pst.","Hey Everyone,

There has been a lot of discussion lately —on reddit, in the news, and here internally— about reddit’s policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I’ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I won’t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!",18691,1436908016,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/,announcements,121
3cucye,samaltman,An old team at reddit,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.


NOTE: I am going to let the reddit team answer questions here, and go do an AMA myself now.

3cbo4m,ekjp,We apologize,"We screwed up. Not just on July 2, but also over the past several years. We haven’t communicated well, and we have surprised moderators and the community with big changes. We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we haven’t always been responsive. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  u/deimorz and u/weffey will be working as a team with the moderators on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit and will help figure out the best way to talk more often. We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.

**Search**: We are providing an option for moderators to default to the old version of search to support your existing moderation workflows. Instructions for setting this default are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).

I know these are just words, and it may be hard for you to believe us. I don't have all the answers, and it will take time for us to deliver concrete results. I mean it when I say we screwed up, and we want to have a meaningful ongoing discussion. I know we've drifted out of touch with the community as we've grown and added more people, and we want to connect more. I and the team are committed to talking more often with the community, starting now.

Thank you for listening. Please share feedback here. Our team is ready to respond to comments.

39bpam,reddit,Removing harassing subreddits,"Today we are announcing a change in community management on reddit. Our goal is to enable as many people as possible to have authentic conversations and share ideas and content on an open platform. We want as little involvement as possible in managing these interactions but will be involved when needed to protect privacy and free expression, and to prevent harassment.

It is not easy to balance these values, especially as the Internet evolves. We are learning and hopefully improving as we move forward. We want to be open about our involvement:
We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to [harass](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.

Today we are removing five subreddits that break our reddit rules based on their harassment of individuals. If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate.

To report a subreddit for harassment, please email us at contact@reddit.com or [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).

We are continuing to add to our team to manage community issues, and we are making incremental changes over time. We want to make sure that the changes are working as intended and that we are incorporating your feedback when possible. Ultimately, we hope to have less involvement, but right now, we know we need to do better and to do more. 

While we do not always agree with the content and views expressed on the site, we do protect the right of people to express their views and encourage actual conversations according to the [rules of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

Thanks for working with us. Please keep the feedback coming.

35uyil,weffey,"Transparency is important to us, and today, we take another step forward.","In January of this year, we published our first [transparency report](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/01/reddits-first-transparency-report.html). In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the [content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014#wiki_requests_for_removal_of_user_information), and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.

Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove **everything**: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than [this, surprised and censored Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/FSXEP66.png).

There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.

Today, this changes. 

**Effective immediately,** we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.

Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen [in its original state here](http://i.imgur.com/Fn5cQFu.png), featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.

Should we receive a [valid DMCA request](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_dmca) for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see [a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why](http://i.imgur.com/gcwz5ks.png). 

A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.

You can view an example of a removed post and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingEffects/comments/35urvq/test_post_please_ignore/).

We hope these changes will provide more value to the community and provide as little interruption as possible when we receive these requests. We are committed to being as transparent as possible and empowering our users with more information.

Finally, as this is a relatively major change, we'll be posting a variation of this post to multiple subreddits. Apologies if you see this announcement in a couple different shapes and sizes.

Anyone on reddit can opt-in to become a beta tester, and receive early access to reddit.com features before we launch them to everyone. 

We'll be using /r/beta as the community hub for the beta program, where we'll announce new beta features and give beta testers space to provide feedback.

There are two ways to participate in the beta program:

* If you're **logged in** to your reddit account, you can opt-in as a beta tester in your [preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/), under ""beta options"". This will automatically subscribe you to /r/beta, so that you'll receive the latest information about new beta features. 
* If you're **logged out**, you can visit [beta.reddit.com](https://beta.reddit.com/) to see beta features. Note: you may end up back on www.reddit.com if you click on a link to reddit from somewhere else, like email or Twitter.

More details on the beta program, including how to give feedback on beta features, are on [this wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/wiki/index). Please note that not every feature will go to beta before launching - some changes may not need extensive beta testing, and we will continue to release some new features to [reddit gold](https://www.reddit.com/gold/about) members first.

In creating hundreds of thousands of communities over this decade, you’ve learned a lot along the way, and we have, too; we’re rolling out improvements to help you create the next 9,000 active communities and beyond!



**Check Out the First Mod Tutorial Today!**

[We’ve started a series of mod tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THHl3VT4vms), which will help anyone from experienced moderators to total neophytes learn how to most effectively use our tools (which we’re always improving) to moderate and grow the best community they can. Moderators can feel overwhelmed by the tasks involved in setting up and building a community. These tutorials should help reduce that learning curve, letting mods learn from those who have been there and done that.   



**New Team &amp; New Hires**

Jessica (/u/5days) has stepped up to lead the community team for all of reddit after managing the redditgifts community for 5 years. Lesley (/u/weffey) is coming over to build better tools to support our community managers who help all of our volunteer reddit moderators create great communities on reddit. We’re working through new policies to help you all create the most open and wide-reaching platform we can. We’re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We’re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community -- [spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam](http://redd.it/2mc9tt), not dealing with spam in your subreddit.



**Protecting Your Digital Privacy**

Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we’ve cared deeply about since reddit’s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address.

No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified. [As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#section_involuntary_pornography).

[We’re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.](http://redd.it/2sk8i9) We’ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report.

We made reddit to be the world’s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We’re learning together as we go, and today’s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond.

We’re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey.

2sk8i9,ekjp,We're updating the reddit Privacy Policy and User Agreement and we want your feedback - Ask Us Anything!,"As CEO of reddit, I want to let you know about some changes to our Privacy Policy and User Agreement, and about some internal changes designed to continue protecting your privacy as we grow.

We regularly review our internal practices and policies to make sure that our commitment to your privacy is reflected across reddit. This year, to make sure we continue to focus on privacy as we grow as a company, we have created a cross-functional privacy group.  This group is responsible for advocating the privacy of our users as a company-wide priority and for reviewing any decision that impacts user privacy.  We created this group to ensure that, as we grow as a company, we continue to preserve privacy rights across the board and to protect your privacy.  

One of the first challenges for this group was how we manage and use data via our official mobile apps, since mobile platforms and advertising work differently than on the web.  Today we are publishing a new reddit [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) that reflects these changes, as well as other updates on how and when we use and protect your data.  This revised policy is intended to be a clear and direct description of how we manage your data and the steps we take to ensure your privacy on reddit. We’ve also updated areas of our [User Agreement](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) related to DMCA and trademark policies.

We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences.  We are experimenting with some ad partners to see if we can provide better advertising experiences in our mobile apps. We [let you know](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/24aevu/we_like_you_all_so_we_wanted_to_let_you_know/) before we launched mobile that we will be collecting some additional mobile-related data that is not available from the website to help improve your experience. We now have more specifics to share. We have included a separate section on accessing reddit from mobile to make clear what data is collected by the devices and to show you how you can opt out of mobile advertising tracking on our official mobile apps. We also want to make clear that our practices for those accessing reddit on the web have not changed significantly as you can see in [this document](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/privacypolicy-2015-01-15.html) highlighting the Privacy Policy changes, and [this document](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/useragreement-2015-01-15.html) highlighting the User Agreement changes.

Transparency about our privacy practices and policy is an important part of our values. In the next two weeks, we also plan to publish a transparency report to let you know when we disclosed or removed user information in response to external requests in 2014.  This report covers government information requests for user information and copyright removal requests, and it summarizes how we responded.

We plan to publish a transparency report annually and to update our Privacy Policy before changes are made to keep people up to date on our practices and how we treat your data.  We will never change our policies in a way that affects your rights without giving you time to read the policy and give us feedback. 

The revised Privacy Policy will go into effect on January 29, 2015. We want to give you time to ask questions, provide feedback and to review the revised Privacy Policy before it goes into effect.
As with previous privacy policy changes, we have enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman) and Matt Cagle (/u/mcbrnao) of BlurryEdge Strategies. Lauren, Matt, myself and other reddit employees will be answering questions today in this thread about the revised policy. Please share questions, concerns and feedback - AUA (Ask Us Anything).

**The following is a brief summary (TL;DR) of the changes to the Privacy Policy and User Agreement. We strongly encourage that you read the documents in full.**

* Clarify that across all products including advertising, except for the IP address you use to create the account, all IP addresses will be deleted from our servers after 90 days.
* Clarify we work with Stripe and Paypal to process reddit gold transactions.
* We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances.
* We use pixel data to collect information about how users use reddit for internal analytics.  
* Clarify that we limit employee access to user data.
* We beefed up the section of our User Agreement on intellectual property, the DMCA and takedowns to clarify how we notify users of requests, how they can counter-notice, and that we have a repeat infringer policy.

2hyyhu,[deleted],"When this post is 59 minutes old, reddit will go down for a brief maintenance","**Edit: all done!**

Greetings,

On this most auspicious of evenings, I'll be performing some maintenance on our RabbitMQ server. Rabbit provides an AMQP message queuing service which allows us to process events on reddit asynchronously (i.e. not in request). Many actions on reddit perform work asynchronously, such as the processing of votes the insertion of comments into comment trees.

We've been hitting a bottleneck somewhere in this system lately, which has caused comments and votes to become slightly lagged during peak-redditing hours. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to tell exactly where this bottleneck lies, so I'll be utilizing the standard sysadmin technique of changing things until something changes or improves.

Due to the nature of how we use AMQP, I must enact data silence on the site to allow the queues to drain for the replacement, which in turn requires a site downtime.

I'll be taking the site down at **0105 PDT / 0805 UTC**. I expect the downtime to last **up to 5 minutes**.


Comments on the downtime thread which don't approximate iambic meter will be stricken. I'll also accept trochees.

cheers,

alienth

Greetings people of the dark,

As you may have heard, AWS is performing a [large number of instance reboots](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-maintenance-update/) in the coming week. Unfortunately the majority of one of our memcache pools is up for reboot tomorrow. To prevent site issues during the reboot, I'm going to be replacing the affected instances tonight. Unfortunately that replacement requires some brief data silence, and as such requires that I bring the reddits to a halt.

I'll be taking the site down at **0905 UTC / 0205 PDT**. I expect the downtime to last **up to 5 minutes**, followed by up to 10 minutes of slowness while the caches reheat.

2fpdax,alienth,Time to talk,"Alright folks, [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.


I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.


Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.


With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.


A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.


When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.


That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.


The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.


In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. 

Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.

This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.


As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. 

Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.



That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.

So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?


The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.

---

Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.

Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!

A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.


Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.

We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.



Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!

A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.


Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?

A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.



Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!

A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).




That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.

293oqs,umbrae,New reddit features: Controversial indicator for comments and contest mode improvements,"Hey reddit,

We've got some updates for you after our recent change (you know, that one where we stopped displaying inaccurate upvotes and downvotes and broke a bunch of bots by accident). We've been listening to what you all had to say about it, and there's been some very legit concerns that have been raised. Thanks for the feedback, it's been a lot but it's been tremendously helpful.

First: **We're trying out a simple controversial indicator on comments that hit a threshold of up/downvote balance.**

It's a typographical dagger, and it looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/s5dTVpq.png

We're trying this out as a result of feedback on folks using ups and downs in RES to determine the controversiality of a comment. This isn't the same level of granularity, but it also is using only real, unfuzzed votes, so you should be able to get a decent sense of when something has seen some controversy.

You can turn it on in your preferences here: http://i.imgur.com/WmEyEN9.png

Mods &amp; Modders: this also adds a 'controversial' CSS class to the whole comment. I'm curious to see if any better styling comes from subreddits for this - right now it's pretty barebones.

Second: **Subreddit mods now see contest threads sorted by top rather than random.**

Before, mods could only view contest threads in random order like normal users: now they'll be able to see comments in ranked order. This should help mods get a better view of a contest thread's results so they can figure out which one of you lucky folks has won.

Third: **We're piloting an upvote-only contest mode.**

One complaint we've heard quite a bit with the new changes is that upvote counts are often used as a raw indicator in contests, and downvotes are disregarded. With no fuzzed counts visible that would be impossible to do. Now certain subreddits will be able to have downvotes fully ignored in contest threads, and only upvotes will count.

We are rolling this change a bit differently: it's an experimental feature and it's only for “approved” subreddits so far. If your subreddit would like to take part, please send a message to /r/reddit.com and we can work with you to get it set up.


Also, just some general thoughts. We know that this change was a pretty big shock to some users: this could have been handled better and there were definitely some valuable uses for the information, but we still feel strongly that putting fuzzed counts to rest was the right call. We've learned a lot with the help of captain hindsight. Thanks for all of your feedback, please keep sending us constructive thoughts whenever we make changes to the site.

P.S. If you're interested in these sorts of things, you should subscribe to /r/changelog - it's where we usually post our feature changes, these updates have been an exception.",4806,1403737764,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/293oqs/new_reddit_features_controversial_indicator_for/,announcements,1764
28hjga,Deimorz,"reddit changes: individual up/down vote counts no longer visible, ""% like it"" closer to reality, major improvements to ""controversial"" sorting","""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit, and is fairly often followed up by someone explaining that reddit ""fuzzes"" the votes on everything by adding fake votes to posts in order to make it more difficult for bots to determine if their votes are having any effect or not. While it's always been a necessary part of our anti-cheating measures, there have also been a lot of negative effects of making the specific up/down counts visible, so we've decided to remove them from public view.

The ""false negativity"" effect from fake downvotes is especially exaggerated on very popular posts. It's been observed by quite a few people that every post near the top of the frontpage or /r/all seems to drift towards showing ""55% like it"" due to the vote-fuzzing, which gives the false impression of reddit being an extremely negative site. As part of hiding the specific up/down numbers, we've also decided to start showing much more accurate percentages here, and at the time of me writing this, the top post on the front page has gone from showing ""57% like it"" to ""96% like it"", which is much closer to reality.

(Edit: since people seem confused, the ""% like it"" is only on *submissions*, as it always has been.)

As one other change to go along with this, /u/umbrae recently rolled out a much improved version of the ""controversial"" sorting method. You should see the new algorithm in effect in threads and sorts within the past week. Older sorts (like ""all time"") may be out of date while we work to update old data. Many of you are probably accustomed to ignoring that sorting method since the previous version was almost completely useless, but please give the new version another shot. It's available for use with submissions as a tab (next to ""new"", ""hot"", ""top""), and in the ""sorted by"" dropdown on comments pages as well.

This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion. Please give it a chance for a few days and see if things ""feel"" better without being able to see the specific up/down counts.",14447,1403120379,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/28hjga/reddit_changes_individual_updown_vote_counts_no/,announcements,0

This revised policy is a clear and direct description of how we handle your data on reddit, and the steps we take to ensure your privacy. Yes, we are going mobile, building an app that covers new ground and complements our site and other existing apps.  No, it is not available yet, and we'll be sure to let you know when it is. We want everyone to feel comfortable using an app made by reddit, so we are building it with the same user privacy protections we have for reddit today. We do want to let you take advantage of all the great options mobile can offer, so you’ll have the ability to opt-in to more features. We will be collecting some additional mobile-related data that is not available from the website to help improve your experience.

As we did with the [previous privacy policy change](/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/), we have enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman) and Matt Cagle (/u/mcbrnao) of BlurryEdge Strategies. Lauren and Matt have done a fantastic job crafting and modifying the privacy policy.
Lauren and Matt, along with myself and other reddit employees, will be answering questions in this thread today about the revised policy. Please share your questions, concerns and feedback about these changes - AUA (Ask Us Anything).

The revised Privacy Policy will go into effect on **May 15, 2014**.  We want to give you time to ask questions, provide feedback and to review the revised Privacy Policy before it goes into effect.

**We allow ad buyers to tailor ads based on a user’s country or metropolitan area. We are now signaling posts that have location targeting on them. We are adding more information about how location targeting affects you in the privacy policy.**

* reddit has allowed ad buyers to tailor ads to your computer’s general location (your country or metropolitan area) as signaled by your computer’s IP address. We think this is a privacy friendly way to provide you with more relevant ads. We continue not to create or contribute to any profile that tracks you across the web. 
* We will let you know when an ad is location-based with simple icons (http://www.reddit.com/wiki/targetingbycountrycity). You should know that interacting with a location-based ad could reveal your computer’s general location (since some ads — like for a music venue in San Francisco — are only seen in some geographies).

**We will be launching reddit Mobile apps.  The information they collect will be governed by the same privacy practices governing the reddit website.**

* If you use the app without signing in to reddit, it will store your in-app activity, but not link it to your reddit account.  
* If you use an app while signed in to reddit, we will associate your app-based activity with your account as if you were browsing the reddit website.
* As is the case with our website, we only use information collected via the app to provide our service, and we never disclose it unless required by law or in an emergency. 
* The app uses Google Analytics so we can learn how groups of users interact with it.
* Deleting your reddit account may not delete the information collected by the app if you previously backed up the app’s information elsewhere.
* A reddit app may also allow you to post to social media, including Facebook or Twitter, but reddit will not connect to the servers of those services, share information with those services, or post on your behalf.

231hl7,alienth,We recommend that you change your reddit password,"Greetings all,


As you may have heard, reddit quickly patched its SSL endpoints against server attack of the infamous heartbleed vulnerability. However, the heartbleed vulnerability has been around for quite some time, and up until it was publicly disclosed reddit's SSL endpoints were vulnerable.

Additionally, our application was found to have a client-side vulnerability to heartbleed which allowed memory to be leaked to external servers. We quickly addressed this after it was reported to us. Exploiting this vulnerability required the use of a specific API call on reddit, and we have analyzed our logs and found nothing to suggest that this API call was being exploited en masse. However, the vulnerability did exist.

Given these two circumstances, it is recommended that you [change your reddit password](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) as a precaution. Updating your password will log you out of all other reddit.com sessions. We also recommend that you make use of a unique, [strong](http://xkcd.com/936/) password on any site you use. The most common way accounts on reddit get broken into is by attackers exploiting [password reuse](http://xkcd.com/1286/).

It is also strongly recommended, though not required, that you set an email address on your reddit account. If you were to ever forget your password, we cannot contact you to reset it if we don't have your email address. We do not sell or otherwise make your email address available to third-parties, as indicated in our [privacy policy](http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#p_13).


Stay safe out there.

alienth

**Edit:** A few people indicated that they had changed their passwords recently and wanted to know if they're now safe.  We addressed the server issue hours after it was disclosed on April 7th. The client-side leak was disclosed and addressed on April 9th. Our old certs were revoked by the 9th (all dates in PDT). If you have changed your password since April 9th, you're AOK.",3926,1397512850,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/231hl7/we_recommend_that_you_change_your_reddit_password/,announcements,4103

Greetings all,

Tonight I'm going to be making a change to a library which our app uses. Our memcached client makes use of an algorithm known as 'ketama' to map keys to our memcache servers in a consistent manner. The default parameters for this algorithm result in some imbalances for some of our pool sizes. I'm going to be pushing out a change to adjust those parameters and hopefully address the imbalance.

Unfortunately adjusting this algorithm means that most of our memcache keys will get mapped to new servers. As a result, the site must be taken completely offline to avoid any split-brain scenarios.

I plan on taking the site down at **0330 PDT / 1030 UTC**. I expect the downtime to last **5-10 minutes**. When the site comes back up it may be slow for a period of time while the caches reheat.

So, ladies and gents of the US-daytime, welcome to a downtime notification. Australia and Europe finally get their revenge for all of the maintenance windows they usually face.


I plan on taking the site down at **1500 PDT/2200 UTC**. I expect the downtime to last **up to 15 minutes**.

See you all on the other side.

We will be sharing more about these issues in the coming days as well as trying to recruit experts for IAMAs and other discussions on reddit.

There’s been much discussion, anger, confusion, and conflicting information about CISPA as well as reddit's position on it. Thank you for rising to the front lines, getting the word out, gathering information, and holding our legislators and finally us accountable. That’s the reddit that we’re proud to be a part of, and it’s our responsibility as citizens and a community to identify, rally against, and take action against legislation that impacts our internet freedoms.

We’ve got your back, and we do care deeply about these issues, but \*your\* voice is the one that matters here. To effectively approach CISPA, the Senate cyber security bills, and anything else that may threaten the internet, we must focus on how the reddit community as a whole can make the most positive impact communicating and advocating against such bills, and how we can help.

Our goal is to figure out how all of us can help protect a free, private, and open internet, now, and in the future. As with the SOPA debate, we have a huge opportunity to make an impact here.

n49rw,alienth,We're back,"Hey folks,

As you may have noticed, the site is back up and running. There are still a few things moving pretty slowly, but for the most part the site functionality should be back to normal.

For those curious, here are some of the nitty-gritty details on what happened:

This morning around 8am PST, the entire site suddenly ground to a halt. Every request was resulting in an error indicating that there was an issue with our memcached infrastructure. We performed some manual diagnostics, and couldn't actually find anything wrong.

With no clues on what was causing the issue, we attempted to manually restart the application layer. The restart worked for a period of time, but then quickly spiraled back down into nothing working. As we continued to dig and troubleshoot, one of our memcached instances spontaneously rebooted. Perplexed, we attempted to fail around the instance and move forward. Shortly thereafter, a second memcached instance spontaneously became unreachable.

Last night, our hosting provider had applied some patches to our instances which were eventually going to require a reboot. They notified us about this, and we had planned a maintenance window to perform the reboots far before the time that was necessary. A postmortem followup seems to indicate that these patches were not at fault, but unfortunately at the time we had no way to quickly confirm this.

With that in mind, we made the decision to restart each of our memcached instances. We couldn't be certain that the instance issues were going to continue, but we felt we couldn't chance memcached instances potentially rebooting throughout the day.

Memcached stores its entire dataset in memory, which makes it extremely fast, but also makes it completely disappear on restart. After restarting the memcached instances, our caches were completely empty. This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores, namely Postgres and Cassandra.

Since the entire site now relied on our slower data stores, it was far from able to handle the capacity of a normal Wednesday morn. This meant we had to turn the site back on very slowly. We first threw everything into read-only mode, as it is considerably easier on the databases. We then turned things on piece by piece, in very small increments. Around 4pm, we finally had all of the pieces turned on. Some things are still moving rather slowly, but it is all there.

We still have a lot of investigation to do on this incident. Several unknown factors remain, such as why memcached failed in the first place, and if the instance reboot and the initial failure were in any way linked.

In the end, the infrastructure is the way we built it, and the responsibility to keep it running rests solely on our shoulders. While stability over the past year has greatly improved, we still have a long way to go. We're very sorry for the downtime, and we are working hard to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

tl;dr

Bad things happened to our cache infrastructure, requiring us to restart it completely and start with an empty cache. The site then had to be turned on very slowly while the caches warmed back up. It sucked, we're very sorry that it happened, and we're working to prevent it from happening again. Oh, and [thanks for the bananas](/r/downtimebananas).",1428,1323313344,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/n49rw/were_back/,announcements,2414
me5e9,reddit,American Censorship Day - Stand up for ████ ███████ ,"reddit,

Today, the US House Judiciary Committee has a hearing on the [Stop Online Piracy Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) or SOPA. The text of the bill is [here](http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). This bill would strengthen copyright holders' means to go after allegedly infringing sites at detrimental cost to the freedom and integrity of the Internet. As a result, we are joining forces with organizations such as the EFF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/).

Part of this act would undermine the [safe harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor) provisions of the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington, please consider [writing your representative](https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml) and the sponsors of this bill:

gva4t,jedberg,On reddit's outage,"As you probably know, reddit was down or degraded for the last 36 hours.  Right now we are still a bit degraded, but we have enough servers to handle the weekend traffic (we think).  We hope to be at full capacity by Monday.

We want to tell you why reddit was down.

In short, Amazon had a failure of their EBS system, which is a data storage product they offer, at around 1:15am PDT.  This may sound familiar, because it was the same type of failure that took us down a month ago. This time however the failure was more widespread and affected a much larger portion of our servers (and not just ours, many other companies were affected as well).  Namely, most of our database slaves were disabled from this outage. Even though we are spread across multiple availability zones (data centers), it did us no good in this case, since the outage was so widespread and hit multiple availability zones.

Since that last failure, we have been doing everything we can to move ourselves off of the EBS product.  We're about half way there.  All of our Cassandra nodes are now using only local disk, and we hope to have all of postgres on local disk soon.

We will continue to use Amazon's other services as we have been.  They have some work to do on the EBS product, and they are aware of that and working on it.  The other services that we use are still performing as expected.

That being said, if you work for another hosting platform and believe you can make a compelling offering, please contact us at hosting@reddit.com, and we'll get back to you in a few days.

The team and I have been up the last two nights waiting for this issue to get fixed on the Amazon side so that we could bring the site up as soon as possible.  Because of this, we probably won't be around much to answer questions in the comments here, but feel free to talk amongst yourselves.  :)

As always, thank you all for your continued support.  And to whoever sent us a pizza, thank you!  It was much appreciated.

To end on a high note, I'd just like to mention that we are making excellent progress on the hiring front to bring on some new developers to help us implement long term fixes.

eorhm,raldi,redd.it: 30% less typing!,"As you may know, reddit has a five-year-old [preference](/prefs) entitled ""display links with a reddit toolbar"" that lets you bring along a 20px strip of reddit whenever you click a submission. [[screenshot](http://www.reddit.com/help/toolbar)]

It's especially useful when opening a bunch of links up in background tabs, solving the issue of ""Why did I open [this random picture](http://www.reddit.com/tb/eohp9) two hours ago?""

It's also turned out to be a good de facto reddit shortlink system. Instead of having to pass around this mouthful:

    http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/em5zw/father_and_son_launch_an_hd_camera_and_an_iphone/

You can just use the toolbar link:

    http://reddit.com/em5zw

This is what the ""share"" button has always done, by the way (have you ever tried it?) Your friend gets a link to the toolbar version, and this way they can see the content, the headline and, should they desire to go exploring, a way to get to the comments. Ideally this will lead them to create an account, and thus reddit moves one step closer to world domination.

Anyway, the reason we're writing about all this today is that we've acquired the domain `redd.it`, shaving a few characters off our shortlinks and bringing them down to a size where we can put them in the sidebar. (Do you see this submission's shortlink up there on the right?)

    FAQ:
    Q1. Is reddit entering the URL shortening business?
    A1. No. We just acquired a cool domain and wanted to show it off.

Note for adblockers: If you made an exception for reddit the simple way (by clicking the stop sign and saying ""Disable on reddit.com""), that'll apply to every link you visit in the toolbar. If you only want to make an exception within reddit, and keep adblock on for external sites viewed inside the toolbar frame, you should instead set things up as described in [/help/adblock](/help/adblock).

We'll end with a protip that, for whatever reason, not a lot of people know about. Skip it if you're easily confused: 

If you're on an external site, and you want to wrap the reddit toolbar around it, you can just prepend ""redd.it/"" to the existing URL. For example, if you're visiting a hot new search engine at `http://www.google.com`, just change that to `redd.it/http://www.google.com` (I know it looks funny, but go with it), and you'll be taken to the reddit page for that URL. If it's not already on reddit, you'll be taken to a prefilled submission page.",835,1292853946,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/eorhm/reddit_30_less_typing/,announcements,2055

ddz0s,ketralnis,reddit wants your permission to use your data for research to build some new features!,"One of reddit's greatest strengths is the huge collection of niche communities and categories of content that we have. One of our greatest weaknesses is that most of it never makes it to the front page. So many vast, undiscovered communities. I mean, just look at my own list of favourites:

[programming](/r/programming), [technology](/r/technology), [comics](/r/comics), [math](/r/math), [Python](/r/Python), [coding](/r/coding), [linguistics](/r/linguistics), [haskell](/r/haskell), [robotics](/r/robotics), [answers](/r/answers), [electronics](/r/electronics), [StandUpComedy](/r/StandUpComedy), [ideasfortheadmins](/r/ideasfortheadmins), [ECE](/r/ECE), [emacs](/r/emacs), [reddithax](/r/reddithax), [Coffee](/r/Coffee), [sanfrancisco](/r/sanfrancisco), [erlang](/r/erlang), [bayarea](/r/bayarea), [chrome](/r/chrome), [redditdev](/r/redditdev), [systems](/r/systems), [artificial](/r/artificial), [compscipapers](/r/compscipapers), [algorithms](/r/algorithms), [macapps](/r/macapps), [horseporn](/r/random ""good catch""), [arduino](/r/arduino), [operabrowser](/r/operabrowser), [SketchComedy](/r/SketchComedy), [golang](/r/golang), [kindle](/r/kindle), [smallprog](/r/smallprog), [robot](/r/robot), [Esperanto](/r/Esperanto), [avr](/r/avr), [hadoop](/r/hadoop), [cassandra](/r/cassandra), [colorblindness](/r/colorblindness), [android](/r/android), [england](/r/england), [BSD](/r/bsd)

We have loads and loads of these communities, some very tiny, but they just aren't very discoverable. I think that helping people find this stuff is a problem worth solving, and so do plenty of researchers and grad students that have contacted us asking for this data (that we've historically had to turn away). There's lots of [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) out there on this kind of problem that we'd like to participate in. There's our [JSON API](http://www.reddit.com/.json), but that's just not enough for the in-depth analysis that we'd like to do and allow researchers to do.

We feel that opening up users' private data to researchers like that has to be done very carefully, and always with the permission of the users affected. So I'd like to announce that, from now on, we're going to share all your private data with DARPA. No, just kidding. Today we're adding a **new [preference](/prefs)** under ""privacy options"" called ""allow my data to be used for research purposes"". **By ticking that box you're agreeing to allow us to include certain data about you in big data dumps** like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/bubhl/csv_dump_of_reddit_voting_data/). This is **optional and opt-in**.

We want to make sure that everyone understands *exactly* what ticking that box will do. The data that you're giving us permission to reveal are:

* Your [community subscriptions](/reddits/mine)
* Your list of [friends](/prefs/friends) **edit1** none of *their* data, just that you friended them **edit2** only friends that have *also* opted in would be listed
* Non-content information about private reddits that you post in (that is, we may share *that* you posted there, but not *what* you posted)
* Your browser's user-agent
* Information on spam reports that you've filed (the `report` button)

On a separate tickbox, you can also share your voting history so that people can see your `liked` and `disliked` pages (this has been there since 2005). Either of these tickboxes will mean that you give us permission to share this voting data. Some items we're considering but want to talk to you about are:

* The last time you visited reddit at the time of the data-dump (in general this can be approximated from your last vote)
* The first two octets of your IP address (that is, if you're at 1.2.3.4, we may reveal that you're at 1.2.x.x)
* A [one-way hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of your email address **edit** looks like this one's out, lots of people seem uncomfortable with it

**Please tell us if you think that any of these are going too far**, especially if you'd tick the box but for one or two of the data involved.

If we ever change or add to this list, we'll reset everyone back to the default of `off` (and/or implement a more granular set of research-related preferences), so you don't have to worry about us sneaking things in there while you're asleep. **You're not agreeing to let us start telling everyone about every link you click or anything like that without your knowledge**. You are not agreeing to let us share the actual content of your private reddits, and **if you do not tick the preference we will not share this data against your will**. This is for research dumps. We're not going to be fielding requests for data about individual users. We're not trying to share identifiable information and in the general case we'll try to keep you anonymous but we all know that [that doesn't always work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_scandal) which is why this is **optional and opt-in**. Did I mention that this is **optional and opt-in**?

Our goal isn't just to get a bunch of data out there, but to use this data to *make reddit better*. We want features like hyper-local communities and recommendations. And we want you guys to [help us](/r/redditdev) shape those features, but to do so and attract interested researchers we need lots and lots of data for analysis. Also, if you don't tick the box, I'll kill [a kitten](http://www.flickr.com/photos/crumley/160490011/)",892,1284515457,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ddz0s/reddit_wants_your_permission_to_use_your_data_for/,announcements,1535

d73ow,reddit,"reddit 101, or: click this if you're new around here! [updated]","Every fall, as people go off (or back) to school, reddit sees a surge
of new users. And now, as we get ready to turn the calendar to September,
we're starting to see the first signs of this annual phenomenon in our
traffic logs.

In past times like this, posts have popped up where the old farts formally
introduce themselves to the newcomers and get a good back-and-forth
going. This way, the latter can ask questions about the site and the former
can detail the precise way they'd like those darn kids to stay off their
lawn.

It's been a while since there's been one of these, so we thought we'd kick
one off today.

Some ideas to get everyone started:

* [What makes reddit special?](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d73ow/reddit_101_or_click_this_if_youre_new_around_here/c0y327r)
* [What are some cool aspects of the site that might not be immediately obvious to new users? Which of the default settings should be changed ASAP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d73ow/reddit_101_or_click_this_if_youre_new_around_here/c0y325u)
* [What are your favorite reddit communities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d73ow/reddit_101_or_click_this_if_youre_new_around_here/c0y31pn)
* [What about reddit do you find ugly or annoying or buggy? Do you have workarounds? Perhaps a GreaseMonkey script or Stylish module?](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/d73ow/reddit_101_or_click_this_if_youre_new_around_here/c0y329z)

bhlao,jedberg,Sorry about that :(,"reddit was down from 12:30 UTC to 14:24 UTC.  Initial indications are that the load balancer went down.  We don't use Amazon's load balancer, we use haproxy on our own instance.

Normally such a thing would cause our web monitoring software to freak out and wake us all up, but unfortunately it looks like that *also* went down at some point (that isn't on EC2 at all).

Again, apologies for the inconvenience.

**EDIT:**  Here's the post mortem.  It looks like we were hit by a bug similar to [this Ubuntu bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/276476).  As you can see, the bug was fixed in a later version of the kernel.  However, the way EC2 works, we can't upgrade the kernel ourselves.  What I can do is switch to a new base image, but I hadn't, mostly because there were always higher priority things to do, and it was never really a problem before.

As for the monitoring, it looks like our monitoring server experienced a power failure sometime yesterday, and the UPS failed, and then it failed to reboot cleanly.

So what are we doing to fix the problem and prevent this type of failure in the future?  First, I'm going to add a second monitor on a Slicehost machine that has been generously donated by a trusted reddit user, and then I'm going to have the two monitors watch each other.  After that, I'm going build a new instance for our load balancer that is on the most recent version of Ubuntu, and does not have that nasty kernel bug.",801,1269441510,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bhlao/sorry_about_that/,announcements,1802

avcxs,jedberg,reddit does not run pop-over ads (at least on on purpose),"As [some of you seemed to have noticed](http://i.imgur.com/n1BUU.png), a pop-over ad was running on reddit this morning.  This was not intentional.  As [KeyserSosa has said](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/akj4z/get_your_mcdigg_on_reddit_if_you_ever/c0jksgg?context=1), we would sooner bludgeon ourselves to death with keyboards than run pop-over ads.

So what happened?  We do not actually control the ad box on the right -- that is outsourced to a company called DART.  We share an account with the rest of Conde, so multiple people have access to this.  Someone accidentally put in the wrong ad for the wrong site, and you saw the result.

If you turn AdBlock off, you will see that we have disabled the box ad and replaced it with something else until we can find out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.

However, blaming problems on a third party just isn't our style.  We take full responsibility for this failure, and apologize profusely.

In the coming days, we will be adding some additional safety measures to the ad box to make sure this never happens again.

As karmanaut [predicted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/avbf2/dear_reddit_whats_with_the_ads/c0jkquf), here is where I ask you to give us another chance and disable AdBlock for reddit.

**What will we be doing?**  We will be performing part two of the maintenance we started [three weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/tb/amumr).  We will be upgrading memcached and memcachedb, and their supporting system libraries.  It turns out we are two major revisions behind, and we'd like to take advantage of some of the new improvements, like the binary protocol.

**Why?** We hope this will further enhance site performance, and make page load times even faster!

**I thought you are ""in the cloud"".  Why can't you do it with no downtime?**  The cloud is not a magic bullet, and we are cheap and lazy.  We could in theory bring up a bunch of new machines that are already upgraded to replace the machines we will be upgrading, but it turns out that moving the data would be a big pain.  So instead we will just take the site down for a bit to do the upgrade in place.

The beauty of the cloud, however, is that we'll have a backup instance already booted and configured if something goes wrong.

**Ok, but why do you have to take the site down?**  One of the things that we are upgrading are the permacaches, which use memcachedb (see previous blog post).  Because of the way we access them, they are currently a single point of failure for us.  We hope to resolve that in the future, but in the meantime, we can't take one of them down without breaking the site, so we'll just take them all down at once.  

**Fun fact**:  Since we took the site down 3 weeks ago, page views are already up about 15%  Lesson:  Site faster == more traffic :)
