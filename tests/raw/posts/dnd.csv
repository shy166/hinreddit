fso1kf,Stevekitty,"Making items for my campaign!!! ideas, comments, suggestions welcome","Made a gnome Kingdome the city is kinda like the one in the dragonlance books. I made them kinda crazy I had in mind the enchantments from WoW the goblin tree where they are good but high risk kinda deal. Anyways I made a few items I'll update as I make more but the one I kinda like I named boots of speed.

Boots that you need to roll a 1D20 to see the effects once per day.

1-4: run uncontrollably for 100ft in the direction they were moving.

5-8: doubles their movement (30 to 60 for example).

9-12: doesn't work and move as normal.

13-16: boots catch fire and cause a fire ball to hit on their location.

17-20: works and they can use them again.

Again comments are more then welcome. I'm trying to make this as fun as I can.

Was thinking of a bottom less bag but of they put a item in it it literally just is a extra dimension straight down forever. Thought if they get crafty they could use it in amazing ways. Like knock out a drow and shove them in the bag.

Hope to hear cool ideas or helpful comments üòâüòé",0,1585697719,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fso1kf/making_items_for_my_campaign_ideas_comments/,DnD,1

Would it be a good idea for a beginner like me to DM a game with only one person?

With everything going on in the world, I've had nothing but time to write and work on some homebrew creations, so I figured I would share them on here! This is my first entry in the Orin Bestiary which will contain all of the creatures and fauna that inhabit the fictional world of Orin.

&amp;nbsp;

Gnarlhorns are among the most ancient of Orin's creatures. Fearsome protectors of nature, these protectors of the forest serve as a living reminder of the time of Gods and elemental beasts on Orin.

&amp;nbsp; 

My goal is to create monsters that are fun to interact with and can be defeated with advanced information and investigation to prepare for the encounter. I am new to homebrew so I apologize if the stats are off but I'm hoping this first entry will serve as a jumping off point to kick-start my writing!

Hey guys, I was hoping an artist would come along and put my character onto paper or the digital canvas.

G-5 is a Rogue Assassin Warforged who was created by Eberron as a spy.

He loves all creatures however, and is accompanied by his small, young green dragon Marsha (female).

G-5's weapons are: very futuristic looking sniper rifle and pistol, as well as a two nice daggers.

He wears a torn cloak that covers mainly his right shoulder and some of that arm.

His body is very similar to the suit of Go Go Tomago from the Disney movie Big Hero 6, with the blades on his feet, he is very skinny, and he is a dark-eggplantey-purple.

If you have any questions I will happily answer in the comments, or you can DM me on Reddit.

The Heart of Adventure is a brand new real-play D&amp;D podcast hosted by 6 down to earth nerds who are are friends but are basically family (some actually). The podcast is set in a homebrew world unlike one you've seen before, with a light whimsical atmosphere. Adventure abounds around every corner, laughs and jokes are mixed with dark and mysterious beats, trips to the shadowfell and voyages on a land-roving, kitten-filled pirate ship called ""The Boar's End"". Come and enjoy as we play along, cry, and scream at the whims of polyhedral plastic pieces.

Each episode is around 1-1.5 hrs and will be posted on the last Tuesday of every month. You can find us at [hoacast.com](https://hoacast.com) or on any major platform. You can also email us at [heartofadventurecast@gmail.com](mailto:heartofadventurecast@gmail.com) with any comments, feedback, or ideas about the show. I look forward to hearing from you all, and remember to always follow YOUR heart of adventure.

Thanks,

Thomas from HoACast

fslfn6,Dragoncat91,Made my first DnD character. New to DnD but not RPing,"I've done post by post forum based RPs for a long time, starting back in circa 2001, when I would RP Warrior Cats on Neopets...and was a cringey preteen, all things considered. I am now 28, almost 29, and since then I have done fanfic and RPs involving Nintendo games, mainly Zelda and Fire Emblem. I have been wanting to try DnD for a good while, and a close knit Discord server I'm a part of is doing it!

I am posting my first character here, I must say I love him already, as much as I love my fankids, OCs and canons for various video games. The first session is on April 4th, any tips or comments for a newbie? Please be nice! Oh, and the art is not mine, unfortunately. A member of the group is drawing for everyone.

fsl50r,Argarath,Almost accidentally killed a insane party member trying to save the party and don't know if I was an asshole or not,"So I am finally playing DnD for the first time after wanting to play for years, and last night's session, after the boss was killed, one of our party members that is insane (he literally has to minds controlling his body) went insane when a evil liquid magic thing touched him, so our party knocked him out and I cleaned him up with prestidigitation and started to tie him down with my rope, tying his hands and feet as well as his mouth because he was a caster. 

 When he wakes up and is still untied. I fear him using some of his custom spells to damage the rest of the party and heal himself, I quickly cast magic missile first level, aiming them all on his head to try to get him knocked out while the cleric of the party hits him with their staff on the head as well. I dealt 9 or 11 points of damage and the cleric dealt 3, and the insane party member falls unconscious. The thing is, the DM made it sound like he just passed out, and he was actually doing death saves this time instead of rolling to wake up like earlier! Luckily the paladin gave him one hp and brought him back, but now the party is constantly joking that I'm the insane one and super aggressive player... Should I take that as jokes and not think too much about it or are they exaggerating? I legit didn't see any other way to stop the insane teammate from possibly killing us all while still being hunted down inside the enemy's fortress : /

fskasd,TapirTamales,Would ambush master allow sneak attack damage on a second attack?,"Ok so this is a little bit rules-lawyer'y but her goes. In XGE you have the scout rogue archetype which has a feature called Ambush Master. XGE states:

*""the first creature you hit during the first round of a combat becomes easier for you and others to strike; attack rolls against that target have advantage until the start of your next turn.""*

Now its pretty clear that the advantage is only given after the first hit, so you definitely wouldn't get advantage on that hit itself. And the advantage ends at the beginning of your next turn so you can't attack using your own advantage.

My question is this: If a player multiclasses between fighter scout rogue to the point where they get an extra attack as well as Ambush Master (rogue 13/fighter 5) would they be able to give advantage to themselves thus guaranteeing sneak attack damage on their second attack? And if so would this even be worth it keeping in mind that if you're ambushing someone you're probably sneaking anyway (in theory)?

I think RAW the player would be able to do this, it would be very technical and you would definitely have some DMs who would overrule RAW. What do you guys think? Am I misunderstanding the rules or is this technically allowed, and if so would you allow it in one of your games?

tl;dr if you can give advantage with one feature can you then benefit from that advantage with a second attack?",11,1585685546,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fskasd/would_ambush_master_allow_sneak_attack_damage_on/,DnD,1

fsk6i3,YoBoiBabyLegs,A fun story on my first session of dnd,"So the other day I finally got to play some dnd,our dm made me and another newcomer lvl 4 while we were creating our first character so we would could keep up with the players that have already been in the session (level 6 elf paladin, and a level 5 half elf Druid) my fellow newcomer became a rock gnome rogue and I became a fighter subclass of Eldritch knight.
        Our session zero put us in a port town (5th edition campaign where revivals slowly decay(can‚Äôt remember detail)). Anyways we end up betting on dinosaur races and all lose our bets, so our gnome rogue decides to steal the pot. Rolling a 5, with a bonus of 3 I think, he got caught by the bet master. As the bet master was taking care of our gnome friend considering attacking or arrest our paladin rolls to grab the pot, and rolls a 20, getting 750 GP while the bet master was distracted. After the paladin swiped the pot, I cast mate hand to grab the bet master‚Äôs ass, giving our little rogue enough time to scamper away. Since he didn‚Äôt successfully steal no further action was taken against him. 
    That was the highlight of the session I thought would be fun to share lol, the paladin gave each of us newbies 100 GP each and spent the rest on a baby triceratops.

TLDR: first session had our gnome fail to steal, our paladin decided to use the gnome‚Äôs distraction to steal, rolls a 20, and I save the gnome by mage hand grabbing the bet master‚Äôs ass to allow the gnome to escape while he was distracted",0,1585685179,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fsk6i3/a_fun_story_on_my_first_session_of_dnd/,DnD,0

fsk2f0,SnekAmigo,A series of mercury-themed magic items. Critiques much appreciated.," **Mercurous Whipblade**

* Type: Weapon (shortsword/whip or dagger/whip)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted hilt and scabbard which create a blade made of pure frozen mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the blade to melt into a boiling liquid mercury whip or freeze it back into a blade. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 cold damage in its blade form and 2d6 fire damage in whip form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the whipblade has run out of charges, the hilt must be attached to the scabbard to replenish all lost charges. The scabbard contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the whipblade as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The whipblade is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. The shortsword version deals 1d6 slashing damage rather than 1d4 like a normal whip. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercurous Gunglaive**

* Type: Weapon (firearm/glaive)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted iron firearm and holster which fires bullets charged with boiling liquid mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the firearm to disassemble and extend into the shaft of a glaive with a blade made of pure frozen mercury or recompact back into a firearm. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 fire damage in its firearm form and 2d6 cold damage in glaive form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the gunglaive has run out of charges, it must be attached to the holster in firearm form to replenish all lost charges. The holster contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the gunglaive as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The gunglaive is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. In firearm form the gunglaive deals 1d10 piercing damage, a normal range of 150 feet and a long range of 375 feet, 25 shots, and the Burst Fire property. It is compatible with modern or renaissance bullets. Its glaive form lacks the Two-Handed property and has the Thrown property rather than the Heavy property with a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 75 feet. You can use an action to summon it back to you as long as you still have the holster. Both forms have the Versatile property. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercury Capsule**

* Type: Wondrous Item
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A capsule of mercury which comes in two variants, one which serves as a refill for the scabbard or holster of a mercurous whipblade or a mercurous gunglaive which holds enough mercury for one hundred charges and can not be used until all remaining charges in the scabbard or holster are depleted, and one which is meant to be attached to a mercury-charged weapon or can use the capsule to coat the blade of a weapon as an action. The weapon must deal slashing or piercing damage. A weapon which deals bludgeoning damage is not eligible for this. This expends one charge and causes the weapon to deal an extra 1d4 poison damage for one minute. This applies to both melee and ranged weapons.

**Mercury-Charged Melee Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any melee weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to leak through the grooves on the blade to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. If you do not replace the mercury capsule after it runs out of charges, you lose the plus one bonus after 1d6 hours and the 1d4 poison damage after 1d10 hours. All penalties are reset when you attach a new capsule. You can take a standard weapon to a blacksmith to have it modified into a mercury-charged weapon for 350 GP. You must also provide one mercury capsule and 25 GP worth of iron ore or whatever other material is applicable. Only weapons which exclusively deal piercing or slashing damage can be made into mercury-charged weapons. Weapons which deal bludgeoning damage are not eligible for this, nore are weapons which already have some additional features beyond their standard version other than silvered or adamantine weapons.

**Mercury-Charged Ranged Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any ranged weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to coat the tip of your ammo to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage.

fsjoyl,Flesh_A_Sketch,Crowd sourcing ideas for the sake of my players.,"My DM came by last Wednesday and asked if I wanted to do a one man one shot. I mean, of course, I love DMing so I set up a thing in a side country from the campaign I ran last year.

Easy peasy. The world is already built, the Homebrew pantheon already populated and filled with personality, and plenty of Easter eggs left over from the big campaign. All I need to do is populate a town, flesh out a culture that already had meat, and insert some baddies.

So my solo player picks a lizardman druid. I put a run in with one of my gods and give him an accidental uplifting so he can actually have a personality that can interact with the society like a proper sapient. He likes it, it makes him unique among his people, but he plays with the idea that Caymen (the local nickname for lizardmen) have zero natural curiosity or creativity. Many thoughts are novel to him and society has many many quirks that he is trying to figure out.

Anyway, one shot has him getting shuttled to the Hunter Guildhouse, he meets the locals, sees the town, and gets mugged.

Muggers get a lucky Nat 20 on the first attack. He wakes up tied up in their house, and proceeds to wreck them all with only 1hp (which should have been how the first fight went). He then takes his time to fashion the leaders femur into a javelin. Police have a nice long chat with him. He no longer tells them about femur javelins.

Sunday comes along, this is our normal DnD day so three of us are there. DM liked playing enough that he wants me to keep DMing.

Alright, no big. I DM on the fly anyway, most of my world is crafted literally as they're rolling perception rolls to see it. Other player rolls up a gnome fighter.

Okay, so I have a gnome fighter and a Cayman druid, they're after a bounty in a nearby town. At some point one of them rolls a Nat 20 on perception. Thinking quick, I tell him that he briefly sees the shadow of a woman across the street stop, look at him, then continue to be the woman's shadow.

In most campaigns, this would be an omen of doom. Players would get worried and start getting paranoid. He's played my last game and immediately realised that the goddess Liek is watching him. She's a trickery/light domain goddess that appears as a shadow in well lit areas and a glowing female shape in dark areas, and is known for low level material plane meddling and shenanigans.

The underdark hates her.

So I told the players that she's scouting them to help another trickery God in his quest to find a new being to elevate into a minor God of war (this a good thing, this war God commands an army that keeps the astral plane from swallowing the material plane and shredding it into nothing.)

And here comes the crowd sourcing.

As much as I slam together the world in general, I can't slam together a major plot arc. I need to have a general sense of where I need to take my players and the trials they need to face to complete that.

I also want to keep them on their toes, and I can only come up with originals so fast.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.",0,1585683623,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fsjoyl/crowd_sourcing_ideas_for_the_sake_of_my_players/,DnD,0

fsjjm5,wh1te_w0lf93,Mad Mage,"I am starting a mad mage campaign this week as a player. I dm‚Äôd Avernus and am now a player again, which I love both. I played a hex blade and a lore bard in CoS, and loved both equally as they were both charismatic espionage a-holes who meddled in the affairs of others. As mad mage is quite different from CoS, I‚Äôm at a loss for a character. 

The party consists of:
V Human Blood Hunter (2020 edition)
Yuanti Pureblood Cleric/Sorcerer 
Tabaxi Swashbuckler
Unknown Gloom Stalker

I have been heavily leaning towards drunken master as they sound like a blast, but we already have two squish and dex melee folk. My hope was to find a beefy boi (beefier the better) who truly focused on magical damage as their source. I thought, ‚Äúpaladin! For Jerusalem!!!‚Äù Alas, DM wants us to have RP purposes for the campaign and really only sees a conquest paladin making sense which to me is the most meh subclass for paladins (which aren‚Äôt my favorite class in the first place).

I‚Äôm particularly torn between Moon Druid, Battlesmith and Bladesinger potentially. They all have their perks, but all have their downfalls. I don‚Äôt want to be spoiled too much of the content, but I also want to feel effective in the dungeon itself. None of those classes really lend themselves to dungeon delving too much besides Battlesmith, but I‚Äôve read they fall off late game.

fsji9i,RandomGuyPii,Quick question about Artillerist's cannon,"So with the  Artillerist, you only get 1 cannon per long rest, unless you spend a spell slot. 

specifically:

&gt; ""Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. or until you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. ""

So if I'm reading this correctly, this means that you get 1 cannon per long rest, and you have to use your spell slots outside of combat to really be able to use a cannon in more than one combat a day.

fsirkv,IdiotLantern,I have a very strange weapon and I'd love to know your thoughts.,"In our very first dungeon we found a room that was, as far as we know, irrelevant to the quest. We didn't need to go in there. We just did it after the boss was killed and the quest was completed. Now, to the treasure that was in this room; it was a simple room and there were indecipherable glyphs on the walls and a small waterfall surrounding a vase with dragons painted on it. I, the fighter was the person to open it. Inside was a small dagger and obviously I plucked it. The water rose and we had to flee from the dungeon with magical chalk that warped is back to the entrance when we snapped it. Nbd, right? Well, this dagger is called The Dagger of Vitality and it's probably the best weapon I've ever seen. When in combat the weapon changes into the precise weapon that is formidable to the opponent. When in combat with large tentacles it becomes an axe. When fighting an Orc it becomes a Warhammer and when battling knights it shifts into a broadsword, etc. Now, here's the kicker. It manipulates me with greed of it's belonging. When I handed it over to have it examined I became almost enraged with jealousy. When my teammates hold it I have to roll to snatch it up from them and on a possible fail, I could attack them. I threw it into a tentacle and when it stuck in and submerged I almost jumped ship to go get it. HOWEVER! It always comes back into my possession. Sometimes I'm arrested and they strip me if my belongings. I won't even know it's back on my person until I just reach for it. There is a shadow character, that my teammates have yet to see, that follows us the whole time whom I imagine swipes it back and places it on me without my knowing. Any ideas or common situations you guys have encountered? I'm so curious. Also I'm kind of railroaded because I can't play my actual character while my dm plays me for me with only rolls keeping me from doing or not doing what the dagger decided to do. Any input is helpful.

fshb0x,Maskedloner,Rate/Review my Character concept,"Name: Kerwyn (or Lyrune, I‚Äôve been debating between the two.)

Race: Half-Elf.

Class: Bard (College of Whisper)

Background: Urchin.

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral.
 
Personality: For personality I was thinking of kind of a Captain Jack Sparrow type of person. An individual who knows how to play the fool to get what he wants. He‚Äôs a bit of a mess, an alcoholic fun-loving person that tries to play up the bard stereotype so (if needed) he isn‚Äôt seen as a threat until it‚Äôs too late (pretending to be a college of lore bard.) While he‚Äôs not a strongly motivated individual, if he needs to get a job done he‚Äôs willing to push himself to the limits to make sure it‚Äôs a success. All in all, he‚Äôs a friendly face with a knack for mischief and a serious side he doesn‚Äôt like to show.

Appearance: a male half-elf with a strong elf influence look (being a naturally handsome man.) He has a darker skin tone (think Spanish descent in the real world.) with shaggy black hair, a bit of stubble, and silvery gray eyes. He‚Äôs built more for dexterity but has a bit of muscle to him. He‚Äôs got many scars all over his body, with his left ear half missing due to being ripped off by rats in his youth. 

Backstory idea:
Kerwyn was found one day as a baby thrown in the trash, abandoned yet saved by a nearby citizen who heard his cries and delivered him to an orphanage. He was raised there for a few years before eventually he was too old and was forced to leave and fend for himself. Of course, living for many years on the street wasn‚Äôt the best life for Kerwyn yet he tried to make the best of it; occasionally stowing away on caravans and moving to a new city if he grew tired of the old one, hoping the next would be better. One day, while he was scrounging around for coin, he met a college of whisper bard who seemed interested in him because of his ‚Äúpretty face‚Äù and convinced Kerwyn (with the promise of a nice meal and bed) to work for their cause. This led to Kerwyn spending a few years of rigorous training to become a college of whisper bard; realizing he had a knack for it (using some of his skills and wisdoms from being an urchin to aid in his training, noting that people who look down on you tend to think your harmless.) The training was difficult and sometimes cruel/dark, but Kerwyn was willing to do whatever it took as it made something of himself and kept him away from his poor past. Kerwyn, after passing his training, became a bard and now works for his college as basically a lackey. He‚Äôs a bit mistreated in the college but he enjoys the fact that he can basically travel all over the world and do whatever he wants until they need him. Basically shrugging and having the mindset of ‚Äúwhat can I do about it?‚Äù To their darker tendencies and morally corrupt ideals (with the alcohol also helping calm his thoughts on some of the things he had/has to do in life.) -This gives him some things to improve and work on as he progresses through the campaign/interacts with other characters.

This is a character I have had for awhile now, with many changes to the backstory (from bland to dark to blandly dark, etc. etc.) I‚Äôve tried scraping the character and moving on but he‚Äôs stayed with me like a bad cold. So, yesterday I wrote a new backstory idea (I haven‚Äôt fleshed it out much as you can tell, keeping one or two things from his older backstories) and now I‚Äôm putting him up here for judgement. There just always seems to be something missing from him and I never know what. Is it the lack of motivation? Is it the personality? Backstory? Again, I don‚Äôt know (and will probably just try to throw him away again if I don‚Äôt figure it out.) So, I was hoping for some new eyes to look at it and give me their criticisms (both good and bad) please.",4,1585676191,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fshb0x/ratereview_my_character_concept/,DnD,1

fsh895,Jdm5544,"Can someone help me understand how ""expert on killing a specific type of enemy"" and ""nature hunter martial"" got rolled into one class? On that note, does anyone else think they should be split into separate classes?","I'm assuming that it's a holdover from previous editions, and probably followed the idea of being an expert at tracking and hunting animals. 

But it also seems like it's been stretched so far. So many base ranger spells are nature based, but then some of the subclasses are so less nature based like monster hunter or horizon Walker.

I get that base 5E ranger has a lot of problems with implementation from the get go. And I think it's a bit late to really do much about it for 5E now. 

But I'm hoping that in 6E, or if we're lucky enough an ""advanced"" 5E, we can get more of a split between the twin concept of Ranger. The normal ranger class being to the druid what the Paladin is to clerics, and then a separate class having then favored enemy a abilities, but separated by subclass as well. 

Maybe a purifier subclass where you get undead, aberrations, and monstrosities (at different levels). Then a planar defender subclass where you get fiends, celestials, and elementals. So on and so forth.

fsh2o7,ThisIsALousyUsername,"Party wants a cleric; but I favor Zorquan - ""Dragon god of dragonness"", suggestions?","Is it even feasible to play a cleric with Zorquan as my patron deity? There is very little attestation of Zorquan; so far as I've been able to find there are a grand total of _two_ canonical books that mention this deific dragon from an age where dragons almost annihilated themselves in a war over their draconic pantheons. 

Zorquan espoused a philosophy of ""let dragons be dragons"", &amp; ostensibly helped to bring an end to their fractious self-destructive war. Dying in the effort, Zorquan was deified as a ""dragon god of dragonness"" but what I've said here is _literally all I can find on the subject!_ 

My previous character was not a cleric, so their choice of deity was not as vital to success. The group I will be playing with (**tonight!**) includes _literal_ lawyers, &amp; the GM is not inclined to allow anything that isn't strictly by-the-book. 

**Is there** ***any*** **reasonable race I could choose that would allow me to take Zorquan as my patron?** Is it just a bad idea to do so? (If Zorquan is not inclined to answer my prayers, or is no longer relevant in the realm we're in, I could see that being a very real &amp; pertinent problem.) 

I _think_ we're doing the Storm King's Thunder module, but I can't be sure until we play tonight. 

I do want to play a Cleric &amp; I'm open to any suggestions for how to do that well. My _preference_ is to worship Zorquan or at least _some_ Dragon (Bahamut, Tiamat, name one!) but I don't know what's likely to be well received by the GM. (No one else in the group had heard of Zorquan.) Most of their characters are an evil alignment of one kind or another.

Now that I'm using roll20, I'm trying to up my game in terms of the assets/icons I use in game to represent characters/monsters.

I have a program that does a great job of creating badges from PNG files. No problem, I have Irfanview, can easily convert most images I find into PNG. 

But I'm not a ""graphics guy"" and the transparency thing is killing me. For example, take this graphic:

JPG format, white background. No matter what I try, I can't get Irfanview to save it with a transparent background instead, which then causes a problem when I ""badgify"" it, because it has a big white square.

Do any of you know how I can turn the white background in that image into transparent??  I've tried Googling this, and have found numerous tutorials - none of which work. I own Irfanview and GIMP, but not Photoshop.

fsg4yv,lookinforasong,Training a Death-Dog,"I‚Äôm working on a one-shot idea for friends and could use some advice or thoughts on the mechanics I‚Äôve devised. There will be about 4-5 level-one characters, whom have been trapped in a castle and commanded by a vampire lord to train his daughter‚Äôs puppy to obey his taught commands. In return they will be set free and avoid being part of a Vampire Banquet-supper in a few nights. I‚Äôve touched up some of the stat-mechanics of Fluffy, the Vampire daughter‚Äôs pet Death-Dog, to make for more interesting gameplay/combat.

They are expected to teach the dog 4 commands (sit, stand, roll-over, and speak) of which only one character per full-round can make a single command when they hit the target (ranged, melee, spell, whatever) as long as the effect does damage, which the Death-Dog would make a WIS save against the command. I would allow the players to speak openly during the combat so that they could coordinate who will do which command and in what order. 

Here‚Äôs the basic mechanics:
Death Dog (WIS +1) starting Resist-Command Wisdom Save-DC= 5; and as he goes down in health the DC will rise. I‚Äôve separated the HP tiers into high (40-28), med (27-12), and low (11-1); increasing his resist save-DC to 11 and 17 respectively.

Additionally, Fluffy has different feats as he is more damaged (the disease-save is relinquished to only the second bite attack every round). At High-HP the first bite has a DC 12 STR save against him grappling the PC; Medium-HP Fluffy loses the grapple but is now frenzied and has Freedom of Movement (bonus disengage) every turn to attack as many characters as possible instead of being stuck dealing with the Goliath Barbarian; and Low-HP loses disengage but has Reaction-bite when he is hit with DC 12 STR save or be thrown 10ft from him.

Finally, each successful command has an affect on Fluffy. Stand=+2 to his next attack and damage rolls (he stands up and lunges down at target); Sit=+4 AC until end of his next turn; speak=DC 14 WIS save or all within 30ft frightened; Roll-Over=Fluffy reaction move up to 20ft in any single direction, opportunity attacks at Disadvantage.

I was thinking they have to successfully give each command 3 times for him to be fully trained. If they actually kill the dog, and don‚Äôt revive him, then the session becomes an escape-mission!

Please let me know if you think this would be a fun encounter. If you have any alternative suggestions to my mechanics, or additions, feel free to send them my way! Any help is greatly appreciated.",3,1585672482,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fsg4yv/training_a_deathdog/,DnD,1

fsfzmw,SnekAmigo,Vambrace of the Offensive and Vambrace of the Defensive. Critiques much appreciated.,"**Vambrace of the Offensive**

* Type: Weapon (longsword) 
* Rarity: Rare 
* Attunement: Yes
* Description:

Though at first glance it appears to be an average steel vambrace, in reality it conceals the blade of a longsword. As a bonus action you can cause the vambrace to unwrap from your forearm and form a segmented longsword held together with glowing solidified energy or retract it back into a vambrace. The longsword remains tethered to you by a cord of energy protruding from the pommel which connects to a steel band on your wrist. You cannot drop the longsword and it cannot be forcefully removed against your will. You get a plus 1 to all attack and damage rolls and cannot use that hand for any other purpose. As an action you cause the blade to project a portion of the energy holding it together in front of it, making it double as a shield. You lose the plus 1 to attack and damage rolls but gain a plus 1 to your AC. If used in conjunction with a Vambrace of the Defensive, they count as one item in regards to attunement.

fsfygl,BlockHead824,Weapon name semantics and back scabbards!,"Short sword is fine.
Rapier is fine.
Longsword is a bastard sword.
Greadsword is a longsword 

Why do I bring it up? Actual greatswords were used as polearms. Actual greatswords were 6+ feet long. Nobody is swinging that around like a sword. 

I‚Äôm sure this gets on a whole 10 people‚Äôs nerves but I am one of those people that it bugs. 

Side note. Back-scabbards don‚Äôt exist. The biomechanics of trying to pull a 3+ ft sword above your head means that you would have to let go of the handle and grab the blade to shimmy it the last few inches. That‚Äôs for an arming sword, your normal cruciform one-handed sword. Please explain how your barbarian is pulling a 6ft greatsword out of a scabbard on their back. 

Related to that, greatswords and longswords typically didn‚Äôt get put in scabbards of any kind. 

Bonus point: grabbing the blade and striking with the pommel was an actual technique used. Swords should be allowed to do bludgeoning dmg. 

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. I realize this is pointless as I can just homebrew my own rules but it gets on my nerves.

Edit: This has caught some flak. I expected it to. Should my title say ""Meaningless semantics""? Probably. I realize that all of this is meaningless.

fsfy02,SnekAmigo,A series of mercury-themed magic items. Critiques much appreciated.," **Mercurous Whipblade**

* Type: Weapon (shortsword/whip or dagger/whip)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted hilt and scabbard which create a blade made of pure frozen mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the blade to melt into a boiling liquid mercury whip or freeze it back into a blade. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 cold damage in its blade form and 2d6 fire damage in whip form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the whipblade has run out of charges, the hilt must be attached to the scabbard to replenish all lost charges. The scabbard contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the whipblade as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The whipblade is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. The shortsword version deals 1d6 slashing damage rather than 1d4 like a normal whip. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercurous Gunglaive**

* Type: Weapon (firearm/glaive)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted iron firearm and holster which fires bullets charged with boiling liquid mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the firearm to disassemble and extend into the shaft of a glaive with a blade made of pure frozen mercury or recompact back into a firearm. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 fire damage in its firearm form and 2d6 cold damage in glaive form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the gunglaive has run out of charges, it must be attached to the holster in firearm form to replenish all lost charges. The holster contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the gunglaive as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The gunglaive is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. In firearm form the gunglaive deals 1d10 piercing damage, a normal range of 150 feet and a long range of 375 feet, 25 shots, and the Burst Fire property. It is compatible with modern or renaissance bullets. Its glaive form lacks the Two-Handed property and has the Thrown property rather than the Heavy property with a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 75 feet. You can use an action to summon it back to you as long as you still have the holster. Both forms have the Versatile property. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercury Capsule**

* Type: Wondrous Item
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A capsule of mercury which comes in two variants, one which serves as a refill for the scabbard or holster of a mercurous whipblade or a mercurous gunglaive which holds enough mercury for one hundred charges and can not be used until all remaining charges in the scabbard or holster are depleted, and one which is meant to be attached to a mercury-charged weapon or can use the capsule to coat the blade of a weapon as an action. The weapon must deal slashing or piercing damage. A weapon which deals bludgeoning damage is not eligible for this. This expends one charge and causes the weapon to deal an extra 1d4 poison damage for one minute. This applies to both melee and ranged weapons.

**Mercury-Charged Melee Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any melee weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to leak through the grooves on the blade to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. If you do not replace the mercury capsule after it runs out of charges, you lose the plus one bonus after 1d6 hours and the 1d4 poison damage after 1d10 hours. All penalties are reset when you attach a new capsule. You can take a standard weapon to a blacksmith to have it modified into a mercury-charged weapon for 350 GP. You must also provide one mercury capsule and 25 GP worth of iron ore or whatever other material is applicable. Only weapons which exclusively deal piercing or slashing damage can be made into mercury-charged weapons. Weapons which deal bludgeoning damage are not eligible for this, nore are weapons which already have some additional features beyond their standard version other than silvered or adamantine weapons.

**Mercury-Charged Ranged Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any ranged weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to coat the tip of your ammo to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. If you do not replace the mercury capsule after it runs out of charges, you lose the plus one bonus after 1d6 hours and the 1d4 poison damage after 1d10 hours.

fsfjij,Villager2020,Horrible first DnD experience. Is this normal?,"The dialogue was s-h-i-t.

Had we transcribed it to paper it would not have passed for a story written by a 6th grader. This is what can be expected I suppose when players are expected to improv-roleplay. Everyone was so polite and agreeable, and predictable, and uncreative.  I looked up some videos of the ""pros"", and to be honest, I found their examples only to be polished shit. They are all just so happy and agreeable that it registers as being affectatious. 

There is also the fact that we are expected to accede to the DM's immediate plot, which means I never had the choice to be contrary or to even act authentic pursuant to the temperament of my character. I HAD to be like ""sure, that's a great idea, let's go!"" otherwise everyone would get irritated that I was trying to derail the plot or be difficult. 

On top of poor dialogue, I find it very awkward for the players to try to act out their own personal conceptions of their characters while following the DM's separate vision, and to expect either party to be satisfied. 

I had flashbacks of playing ""make believe"" as a 5-year old, when someone inevitably got pissed off and threw the plastic burger-patties, lettuce, and buns 10 feet into the air, then stormed off to go play with their legos. 

So, should I be surprised/dismayed, or is this really just ""make-believe"" for adults? Because if it is... I can understand.",20,1585670568,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fsfjij/horrible_first_dnd_experience_is_this_normal/,DnD,0

fsffs2,Mystran,Do you have any specific strong opinions on D&amp;D?,"Hey,

I'm feeling slightly bored and am interested in hearing any strong/unpopular opinions you might hold about the game.

Starting off with a few of mine:  
1-Pre-written adventures are too rigid to be enjoyable. I feel like most DM's should make heavy adjustments around the players and add new homebrew elements to make them tolerable.

2-I'm much less invested in campaigns that take place in official settings. Playing in a person's homebrew world immediately makes me much more interested in the world/characters/story as a whole.

3-The game is way more fun when things go wrong.

4-The alignment system is kind of pointless and anti-character development. A player should know their PC well enough to know how they would act and being enforced via alignment is restrictive.

5-Humans are by far the most interesting/versatile race.

6-Villains should be crafted around the PC's and act as foils for them.

fseoib,Wigriff,Large D&amp;D/TTRPG Discord to Host Covid-19 Fundraising Event,"First off, thanks so much to u/Iamfivebears and the rest of the r/dnd mod team for letting us spread the word to this excellent community. 

&amp;nbsp;

Hail and Well Met! My name is Wigriff and I currently help run a large ttrpg Discord community called *Dungeons &amp; Downvotes*. 

&amp;nbsp;

**A bit about us:** 

Dungeons &amp; Downvotes is comprised of nearly 6000 people from all over the world, ranging from brand new players to people with decades of experience. We have dozens of  long-term campaigns going on right now, as well as a constant revolving door of 1-shot games being posted on our 'adventures' bulletin, across countless game systems including D&amp;D 5e, 3.5, AD&amp;D, World of Darkness, various OSR systems, Pathfinder, and many more.  

We also have workshop channels for advice and inspiration, social hangouts, rooms for DM/GM resources, player resources, a gallery with user-submitted art, and dedicated rooms, both private and public, for voice and text chat to be used for games. Many games posted on our adventures bulletin utilize a combination of Roll20 and Discord, but some games use only voice chat, text chat, or 'theater of the mind' as well. 
      
&amp;nbsp;

**Why we're making this post:** 

We frequently do themed server events where, if you host a one-shot game during the time-frame of the event, you're entered in some sort of giveaway or raffle. We have historically done it just for fun, and to promote more games being played on the server, but considering the current state of affairs in the world we have decided to do something a bit different this time. So, r/dnd, we implore you to...

**[Bring Out Your Undead!](https://i.imgur.com/3vT9jRS.jpg)**

*‚ÄúI have no idea what's awaiting me, or what will happen when this all ends. For the moment I know this: there are sick people and they need curing.‚Äù*
‚Äï Albert Camus, The Plague

‚Äî Run a one-shot (or several!) on our server between Friday, April 3rd and Sunday, April 12th. Advertise these games in the #bring-out-your-undead channel. Your game does not have to be undead-based in order to qualify.

‚Äî After you‚Äôve run your one-shot, send me ( @Wigriff ) a private message to say you have done so. I will then add you to our public list of DMs who have successfully run a Bring Out Your Undead one-shot. 

‚Äî **For each individual game run during this event the Woobly (Moderator) team will donate $5 to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy's (CDP) COVID-19 Response Fund.**

‚Äî Every DM who has participated in the event will receive the vaunted role of **‚ÄôPlague Doctor'.**

&amp;nbsp;

We welcome you all to come out, join our community, and participate in some games for a good cause! Thank you for your participation and support! *Please keep in mind that we are going to likely cap the donation amount to $600, as the donations will be made entirely by our small moderator team, out of our own pockets, and none of us happen to be millionaires (unfortunately).*

**Thank you again!**

Hello everyone! I'm a new DM who has only run Sunless Citadel, and the first part of Hidden Shrine of Tomoachan in addition to a handful of sporadic sessions. I am still cutting my teeth with modules before I delve into making my own campaigns and encounters.

I am about to run Against the Giants, and I see that it is recommended for 4-5 11th level characters instead of the 6 I plan on running it with. I understand how even one extra player in the party can drastically change the difficulty of an encounter.

What changes would you recommend to rebalance the adventure as to ensure it is still a fun challenge to the players? Would adding a single giant or a couple of ogres to each room/encounter enough? How about just upgrading AC/HP to not further bog down combat with additional combatants? Just start everyone at level 10 instead?

Thanks a ton for the input everyone, I'm really trying to ensure the module will be fun and challenging for the group even with the larger size of the party.",1,1585666327,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fse996/running_against_the_giants_5e_for_6_players/,DnD,3

fse7gz,CoasterLife,Looking for more ideas for a sex dungeon themed one shot,"Last year, I ran a rave themed one shot where I created classes based on rave stereotypes like a bro, kandi kid, rave mom, wook, headbanger, etc. We played with traditional DnD 5e roles but set in the real world. It went super well because all of my friends are ravers and we could play into those stereotypes well. It has made me want to do more themed one shots and my next idea was a sex dungeon themed one because my friend group is also into the kink scene.   

&amp;#x200B;

I have some ideas on classes (dominatrix, furry, etc.) but would love any ideas you guys may have for game mechanics, sex themed monsters, or even a pun for the name of the one shot. Thanks!   

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Just to clarify, this game will NOT have any sex in game whatsoever or anything similar. The sex dungeon is only a theme that will allow for some stereotype based jokes with the characters. I want it to play out like a normal one shot, maybe with a mystery to solve, where they just happen to be in a sex dungeon.",10,1585666149,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fse7gz/looking_for_more_ideas_for_a_sex_dungeon_themed/,DnD,0

fsd5jy,wil-thieme,[5e] Tabaxi Monk Speed Calculation,"I know there have been a lot of discussions about various speed bonuses, but I'm having a hard time parsing this one. Can anyone weigh in?

I have a player who is a Tabaxi Rogue/Monk Multiclass with Boots of Speed and I'm trying to understand the interplay between the various speed bonuses.

**Tabaxi Base Speed**: 40  
**Feline Agility:** When you move on your tum, you can double your speed until the end of the tum. Can't use again until you move 0 feet in one round.  
**Monk Movement:**  Speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield.  
**Cunning Action:** Dash as bonus action.  
**Boots of Speed:** If you click your heels together as a bonus action, the boots double your walking speed for up to 10min/long rest.

**Dash**: When you take the Dash action, you gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers.

Obviously the unarmored speed is now 50ft/rd. Activating the boots of speed ""doubles your walking speed"" which could mean a total of 100 or 90, depending on whether the +10 is doubled.

Finally, assuming the boots are already going from a previous round, he can bonus action dash which should be 130ft, 140ft, or 150ft, depending on how all of this combines.

The tight quarters made her fear effect really strong, so after being frightened one of my players told me that he was going to grapple the creature and pull it deeper into the cave, away from everyone else. 

I told him that he couldnt do that because he can't move closer to a creature he's frightened of. He countered by saying he wasnt ever moving toward the creature, just grappling it, moving laterally around it, then running away from it while grappling it but still pulling it behind him. 

I DM vetoed the idea because it doesn't make sense to me that he would be so magically frightened by this creatures supernatural abilities that he literally cant move toward it, but he *would* still be able to physically pull the creature behind him as he's moving deeper into the cave.

I'm not sure of what bigger story to evolve this into but I have some ideas. 

- They discover a Treasure Map (or piece of one) hinting at *Legendary Renowned Pirate's* treasure trove hidden somewhere in the world and have to hunt it down, fighting other Pirate crews also seeking the treasure

- They're prompted by a person of power into becoming Pirate hunters, hunting down the legendary *insert number* pirate Lord's causing terror across the world 

- I let them go crazy and decide on their own adventure, making adjustments and improvise as they go along.

fsc97a,Toowe22,One Spell Slot Started a Chain of Events Which Led to 3 PC Deaths,"So our party is playing through Strahd and we got to Vallaki last session. We are using some curse rules that let you come back to life after you die but with a random curse. Our fighter had a curse that meant his heart would stop if he didn't take lightning damage every 24 hours.

Our warlock decided that in the middle of the town square surrounded by guards would be a good time to cast witch bolt (1 spell slot) at the fighter. This obviously got him and the fighter into a lot of trouble with the Baron, especially after they decided to run away. 

A few days later when we were in the Blue Water Inn and they didn't have any magic to hide, the guards broke in and took both members of the party. They were immediately taken to a public gallows and were going to be hung. 

The rest of the party decided that they should break them free but a series of bad rolls led to a massive battle with almost every guard in town. Everybody went down and it went to death saves. 3 people made it to stable but one of them was the warlock and was executed while the other two were taken into custody. 

The worst part is that the warlock didn't even do enough damage to jumpstart the heart so this whole series of events happened for nothing.

fsbtto,Acidosage,[5E] How do I make combat interesting?,"I'm planning to DM a campaign in a few months and want to know how I can make boss battles more interesting. I've got a boss in mind who is an angel turned evil called ""Lucifer the Almighty"". He has two phases, the first phase, he is an above average fighter really. He's got a longsword, a longbow (with a special feature that means he can switch weapons at the start of the turn without using an action), a parry and riposte and a few legendary actions. He's sort of feels like an eldritch knight mixed with a battlemaster. This is to give a false sense of security. He will be dangerous, don't get me wrong, but he's basically just as tough as any other knight. 

When he drops to 0 health, flames will erupt from inside him and everything about him will be boosted. His weapons will be greatly boosted, now doing fire damage and chances to attack multiple times with one attack and a 50ft flying speed. He will gain a lot more speed and movement and the environment will become more varied and technical. What was previously a blank and empty vast flat floor will now be a large collection of rocks and lava that provides cover, verticality and a chance for hiding to catch a breather (to get sneak attacks and stuff).

fsbdsv,mozennymoproblems,Looking for feedback on a silly sorlock build,"Haven't thought too much past level 7 but would love some feedback on this build and if you think it's by the book or I'd be asking my DM for flavor favors.

&amp;#x200B;

Flying Tiefling Variant   

2 Levels Warlock

  Otherworldly Patron:  The Noble Genie (UA)

  Invocations: Grasp of Hadar, Repelling Blast

&amp;#x200B;

5 Levels Sorcerer

  Sorcerous Origin:  Aberrant Mind (UA) 

  Metamagic: Quickened and Twinning

&amp;#x200B;

Aberrant mind gives us Hunger of Hadar, Noble Genie lets our spells originate from a person/creature to whom we are tethered within 100 feet. (tether as an action, charisma mod times per day, lasts an hour)

&amp;#x200B;

The plan:

Cast of Hunger of Hadar. Fly above HoH. Rely on my tethered companion to get himself on the opposite side relative to me of an enemy. Use first eldritch blast cast from my position, using my once per turn Grasp of Hadar to pull the enemy 10 feet up and towards me. Quicken eldritch blast from my tether friends position, using Repelling blast on both shots.

&amp;#x200B;

Dumb example math:

I'm directly in the middle of HoH but 30 feet in the air. Enemy is 30 feet away from the center of HoH, my tether boi on the opposite side. I'm \~42 feet away from the enemy. Grasp pulls him 10 feet closer to me, double repelling pushes him 20 feet closer to me more or less along the same line. This puts the enemy \~21 feet into the air and \~11 feet into Hunger of Hadar.

&amp;#x200B;

The results:

Enemy takes 4 eldritch blasts and 20 feet of falling damage. Enemy starts turn prone and blind inside of difficult terrain and with 2d6 cold damage. Enemy has to dash to have a chance of getting out (hoping DM will have them run random direction since blind). Potentially takes 2d6 more acid damage and 2d6 more cold at the start of their next turn before they get out.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking for future levels:

I think I want at least 5 levels of warlock. Another invocation for agonizing for damage or lance of lethargy to really get people stuck in Hadar, level 3 spell slots for more sorcery points on demand/HoH casts. Not sure about what to really invest in after that. I have a few forced movement spells picked out. Psionic Blast seems especially useful to knock groups into HoH (and also prone). I think I'm pretty interested in Blink, I have Misty &amp; Thunder step. My dream is to kind of be Night Crawler but slinging spells and eldritch blasts that force my opponents into a hellish void.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love some suggestions and feedback. I think the hardest part to sell of this plan is my quickened blasts being soon enough after my initial action to still hit my enemy while he's in the air and whether or not I'd have disadvantage trying to hit an enemy mid air wit those quickened blasts.",3,1585654628,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fsbdsv/looking_for_feedback_on_a_silly_sorlock_build/,DnD,1

fsa71q,DoktorValue,"My character has left the party. Am I the asshole, guys?"," 

As my character died mid session, i created a new one, a warrior / warlock crossbow wielding demon hunter, his patreon are his ancestors granting him power, and a talking familiar sword of his father that thirsts for revenge against demons and similar monsters.

I was really enjoying the character roleplaying it and everything was going well, although i was kinda sad that the DM rushed through my introduction and people didn't understand my detailed backstory well enough.

Anyway, we approach a beholder that is apparently maimed and acts friendly. My character doesn't buy it, this thing looks like something that should not exist. I use suggestion on him to show his true nature in order to convince my party that he is a threat. I tell him to stop this charade and he attacks me. the DM announces that the cleric with high passive perception realizes that i cast a spell.

Everyone then in an epic meta gaming moment comes to think that I made him hostile. That i, a demon hunter made a fucking beholder evil, and this comes from our cleric who literally talked to his deity, asking him to send a divine warrior to help them kill the demon lords. He distrusts me as well as his diety and everyone else too in a metagaming moment.

The beholder slaps my ass throwing me in the air, paralysing, fearing and charming me in 2 turns while everyone watches. The cleric claims that the beholder hasn't done damage to me yet so he doesn't attack, as if i'm not fucking mentally dead and paralyzed in the air.

At this point the sorcerer casts banishment on me.

They talk to the beholder for one minute and he's like no i'm cool.

They believe him and as i reappear from a harmless demiplane, humiliated and betreayed by the people that should be my party members who asked help of me, the dm asks what do i do.

At this point nothing makes sense except for my character to leave the party and continue his quest by himself as he can no longer rely on the party.

Have i done the wrong thing? Is it too much to ask to do this fight against an npc that is irrelevant to the plot but very relevant to my backstory?

fsa4hr,Lazarock,Creating a level 10 undead dread necromancer resisting a rebuking,"Hey !

I'll start in a near future a new campaign with a lvl 10 character and I choose Dread Necromancer for the flavour (it happens 2 years after a massive war between orcs, dwarves &amp; dragons).

But, I heard that another player will play a cleric/apostle of peace and I think this is a problem.

He's a full optimizater, I know every dip he could made was so he'll be near invicibility, and I think that he will not really try to let my minions do their job (or worst, trying to destroy me because I'm an undead). He's already at 35 AC and 13 feats, no great doubt he will try to outpower me and my zombie-squad.

I tried to discuss with him numerous times about his characters (always overpowered, but it's allowed by the DM so... that's fine), but he's a bit stubborn and I don't see why this one would be an exception.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have some suggestion to help me and my pals resist easier to this kind of things ?

fs9ig2,jonathino001,[Lore Question] The Weave,"So this is a question that has been bothering me for some time now. What forms of magic require the weave to function?

Firstly I know that Psionics is explicitly defined as non-magical, and doesn't require the weave, but that's about the only one I could find that's definitive on the issue. For all other playable classes I have more or less confirmed that they do, in fact, require the weave, with the exception of the monk, and I suppose the barbarians weird totem magic shit.

Also while cleric or paladins spells do require the weave, it isn't clear whether a gods power itself does. At least a few must not, since they existed before the weave, but we don't know if that's the case for all gods. We know they all require worship to fuel their power and existence (except for overgods like Ao) but that's as much as I know.

And what about monsters with innate magical powers, like a displacer beast, beholder, or a dragons breath weapon?

Note that you can't use spells like anti-magic field as a reference since in previous editions they didn't affect the weave, but instead prevented magical effects themselves. So the lore is kinda all over the place.

P.S: I'm not looking for your interpretation of the lore here, since anyone can have there own interpretation, (hell, even I'll probably go with the interpretation that makes the most sense to me at the end of the day.) I'm looking for definitive lore.

fs9cwk,Stygious,Green Arrow Inspired PC,"Our GM is starting a fresh campaign at level four, here‚Äôs what I concocted after watching the entire arrow verse in quarantine. Here are the essentials:

Human Variant
-  +1 to Dex and Wis
-  Sharpshooter feat
-  Stealth

Three levels of fighter: battle master and one level of Monk (leading into the Kensei subclass).

Unarmored AC of 17 (19 with Kensei Melee weapon). 

Battle master maneuvers:
-  Precision Attack (to better utilize SS)
-  Disarming Attack (for control and Green Arrow flair.)
-  Parry (for mitigation vs big attacks when I‚Äôm tanking with the longsword with the Kensei +2 to AC with the longsword)

Kensei Weapons:
-  Longbow (obviously, it‚Äôs the green arrow)
-  Longsword (versatile 1d10 when forced to go melee) 

Things will be fun to start at 4 but at level 6 when I take Kensei I get so much versatility between sheer damage and defense if I get rushed.

fs9cop,Herskthefakepaladin,The most ridiculous damage I‚Äôve ever seen a PC do...," So in light of the quarantine I offered to run a one shot on Roll20 and discord to help my friends get a quick DnD fix. The game took place in a world where magic was outlawed (Think Karsus but the new goddess of magic just locked the weave) So all of the Pcs has to choose martial characters, which wasn‚Äôt an issue because the most of them play martial classes anyway. One of my players who always makes really neat characters wanted to make a joke character. A goblin rogue that was supposed to die within the first three rounds of combat, he ended up living to the very end. Acquiring a fancy magic quarterstaff with latent magical abilities (The thing had 3 charges of Misty Step) which I gave to make up for his PCs lack of mobility. ((Now before I get into the shit show that was the final boss, I need to explain a house rule I introduced. Criticals have always been kind of lackluster to be, an extra damage die seem so anti-climactic. So I have a rule where the attack deals max damage, plus the damage die the original attack gets. For example a critical with a great sword would do 12+2d6+modifiers. Which is MUCH more damage than a boring 3d6. And tilt add to that for this campaign I added confirmed Criticals with no limit.))

Okay now onto the final battle, the party found the orcish warlock who had using his demonic sorcery to enthrall local beasts to attack the town. (For an image imagine Guldan from world of Warcraft) the warlock with some really good rolls, blasted the goblin and destroyed the quarterstaff. I thought this might have taken him out but he succeeded his death save but just barely. On his turn he grabbed a great axe on the floor... and struck. With 4 consecutive natural 20s... dealing 12+12+12+12+1d12+2d6(improvised sneak attack) in slashing damage. Rolled nearly max damage at 69(nice) slashing damage in a single hit. Dealing over half his health, and the warlock failed his death saves. Effectively one-shoting the bbeg.

So yeah, I am no longer allowing confirmed Criticals in my games.",7,1585643917,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs9cop/the_most_ridiculous_damage_ive_ever_seen_a_pc_do/,DnD,1

fs8705,DemetrioM,My group has conceived a crapload of characters in the years we've been together. Rate them?,"To elaborate, I want to boast about the many innovative ideas my group has brought to the game throughout my DM'ing career. I do wonder though if their ideas will be well received at other tables? In particular, what I am looking for in review is:

- How well developed you think they are,

- How long you think theyd last in your game,

- If they have any glaring flaws in need of dire improvement.

Now let us begin.

- Chad Giggsby, Halfling Wizard. Runs a brothel by the name of ""Lady Luck"", carrying himself with style and swagger. Learned wizardry for the sake of the clout that came with it. Always looking to expand his clientel, and would rather talk business than whip out the ~~pimp hand~~ spellbook.

- Mercury, Simic Hybrid Sorlock. A Squid man who spares no expense in driving his agenda (establish a cult worshipping the ocean, drown the landlubbers,) forward at any cost. Seems to obsess in particular over the ""superior anatomy"" of Cephalopods.

- Totuth Shinstones, Goliath Paladin. He does not subscribe to the typical Goliath ideal of ""Survival of the Fittest"", for he sees what the strong do to the weak. And so he fights the strong, for the sole purpose of showing them just how weak they truly are, propping up the oppressed so that they may become strong (and restart his cycle of conquest when it goes to their heads). His favored enemies to conquer are any kind of Tyrant, from foul kings to Red Dragons.

- Brick, Revenant Orc Fighter. Once from a slave caste, he died and returned as a revenant, strangely under the control of a Kobold named Mortar, who became his love interest. He persists past a Revenant's one year shelf life because of Mortar, fiercely protecting her with naught but his brutish fists. Speaking of...

- Mortar, Kobold Sorcerer. She lacks any kind of control over her Sorcery, as she is a Wild Mage. She tries to be nice, but her ""incidents"" with magic tend to bring out hostility more often than not.

- Francesco Fyelli, Aasimar Cleric. This angelkin is a self-proclaimed ""War Scholar"" who aims to raise a perfect military state that can function at peak capacity during times of war. While his bizarre accent may confuse people, he is well versed in topics like siege tactics, restoring scorched earth and salted fields, as well as how to quickly desensitize troops to the horrors of war.

- Inyere Brushwood, Half-Elf Paladin. A noble soul who tries to bring the wicked onto a more righteous path, fighting only as a last resort. Typically fulfills the team mom role.

- Lyle Brushwood, Human Warlock. The adopted son of Inyere, even kinder and far more naive. So naive in fact that he picked up a weapon made of condensed evil at the age of 19 and became a Hexblade on the promises of high adventure. Has always been a surprisingly effective hit-and-run combatant.

- Roscoe, ""Gnome"" Wizard. Can hardly be called a Gnome anymore, as experiments and disasters transformed him into a tentacled abomination who is senile, almost exclusively telepathic, always hungry, and a master of Magic Missile.

- Bruja Esceleto, Human Barbarian. Abandoned in the wilds as a baby, and raised by Fey. He grew up with feelings of insecurity, as he was so much larger than his Pixie friends, and remarkably, had even more fabulous hair. While mechanically, he is a typical rage, smash, laugh at damage type of guy, the most hilarious thing about him is a roleplay quirk. His Fey guardians told him to never use profanity, and so if he does swear at someone, he conveys it through glares and muscle flexing.

- Rickety Snivel, Gnome Rogue. A drunken wretch who converted his silly hat into a rapier. Can never keep his lies straight, and has a multiple choice backstory which he enjoys invoking. No one is sure if he is actually drunk all the time or if he is just that good at faking it. He also enjoys being used as a thrown weapon.

- Shield Captain Floyd, Human Paladin. Heavy armor? Check. Twin shields? Check. The Shield Master feat? Check. Magic Initiate Sorcerer for the Shield Spell? Check. By the time he gets up to speed in levels, his Armor Class is just ""Yes."" Invokes the persona of DEUS VULT to demoralize anything that would dare oppose him, but has a swell side to his close companions.

- Anderson, Human Rogue. Former marksman in any given army, by the time an adventure begins he is retired, drunk off the flagon, and wracked with Survivor's Guilt. Will accept any alcohol or booze provided. The mere mention of Ogres, the monsters who killed his men, will send him flying into a rage, matched and exceeded only by seeing one in person.

- Sentinel, Warforged Fighter. In his early years, he met a sick High Elf, who wanted to see the world but was too ill and frail to do so. As a compromise, Sentinel offered to be scryed on as he went on adventures so the Elf could watch how it was done. The Warforged spares no effort in heroic theatrics and has a blunt flair for the dramatic, to make it as entertaining to watch as possible. Goes the extra mile of fighting with just his fists and shields to drag out fights for sport.

- Heinrich Klaus, Human Cleric. Creepy with a capital K, mentally unstable and morally grey. He enjoys healing people as much as he does hurting them; stitching together flesh providing the same thrill as tearing it apart. The help and harm philosophy also applies to his take on psychology, driving some to insanity, guiding others out of their despair. One could say he is addicted to change, both good and bad. ^^^Hail ^^^Tzeentch

fs7irt,-cloudyclovers,Is this a good riddle for some PCs?,"So one of our characters are possessed by a nymph named minthe. I'm wondering if this is a good riddle :)

One moment here
Another moment gone
Watch the person
Not know what‚Äôs wrong
Watch their eyes
Go up and down
Be careful next time
You make a sound
Something is here
Someone is gone
Don't let them know what is wrong

One moment here, another moment gone = Basically they can be themselves, and all it really takes is a word to make the other person take control

Watch this person not know what's wrong = everytime minthe takes over the character can't remember what happened not does the character know they are possessed

Watch their eyes, go up and down = when this person gets possessed their eye changes slightly to a aqua color and it's so unnoticeable that it requires a role over seventeen

Be careful next time you make a sound = basically means, certain words or sentences can change the person into the other one. So you have to choose your words carefully as to not bring back minthe. If it helps minthe can be triggered with these words
Cult
Bar
Rat
Knife 
Poison
River
Beer
Liquor 
Whisky
Alcohol 
Alcoholic 
Cocktail 
Mint
Minthe
Min
Demon
Tiefling
Satan
Hell
Underworld

Nymph 
Dagger
Gamble
Money
Dollars
Coins
Gold
Silver
Curse
Binding
Curious 
Scared
Fear
Despair
Help
Leader
Boss
Casino
Woodsburrow


Something is here=basically meaning that minthe is possessing the character

Someone is gone=meaning the character has been possessed by minthe and the possessed person won't remember anything

Don't let them know what is wrong = don't tell the character or else the next time minthe possesses them she will kill the character.

fs7489,Nicholas_TW,How to deal with DMs ignoring Passive Perception?,"tl;dr: I've played with three different DMs who tend to either ignore or misunderstand how the Passive Perception mechanic works, and I'd like advice on how to get my DMs to actually implement these rules correctly or tell me they're houseruling it from the beginning of the campaign. I'd appreciate advice.

 Pg. 175 of the PHB:

&gt;A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn‚Äôt involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here‚Äôs how to determine a character‚Äôs total for a passive check:  
&gt;  
&gt;**10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check**  
&gt;  
&gt;If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.

I once made a character whose major party role was being a lookout, and maximized my PP; I had a high WIS, was proficient in Perception, took Observant, and got a DM-approved item which granted advantage on all Perception checks, for a total PP of 23. Awesome.

Later, during that game, we suddenly got ambushed by a bunch of (large-sized) driders. Attack rolls were made, we all got stuck in webs, we had to roll initiative... a bit too late, I asked if it looked like they were coming out of some kind of invisibility or teleportation spell or something, but the GM told me no, they snuck up on us. I didn't want to make a huge deal of it because he'd have to roll things back, but apparently all six large-sized creatures all managed to roll above a 23.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried a similar build with a different DM and he was a bit better about remembering that Passive Perception is a thing and he couldn't just have enemies appear (although the moment I took Observant, it felt like nearly every stealthy enemy suddenly gained Expertise(Stealth)...). The issue was, he refused to let me use my Observant bonus on anything other than my PP (which, RAW, is correct). And he refused to let me use my PP on any perception check that he didn't already want me to use PP.

**Example**:

Me: Can I take a 10 on my perception check to look for treasure?

DM: Sure.

Me: 22.

DM: Oh, you don't get your Observant bonus because you're actively looking, not passively.

Me: ...Can I... *passively* take a gander around the area and just kind of see if I *happen* to notice anything??? Since apparently my character is better at noticing things when she's not actively trying?

DM: Uh. No. Roll.

**Also**:

DM: So you're at the party, and there are all sorts of things...

Me: Did I notice any magic items while we were entering?

DM: Perception check.

Me: Can I use my passive?

DM: No, because if you're asking then you're actively looking.

Me: \[\**Doesn't even know where to start with explaining why he's wrong, just goes with it so I don't argue with the GM*\*\]

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on, but you guys probably get the idea by now; DM's I play with keep either ignoring that Passive Perception exists for the sake of ambushes, or critically misunderstand how it's supposed to be used. I've tried showing them the exact rules but they either don't read that section or still misunderstand the point of passive abilities.

I'm fine with DMs not using the PP mechanic (or altering it), as long as they *tell me* before I make my character, so I'm not stuck with a feat that only works when it's convenient for the DM. But during CC, when I ask them if they plan on using PP as-written, they always say yes and then do things like I described above. Any suggestions for ways I can get my DMs to actually commit to one or the other? Or should I just stop making characters with good perception and just resign to only see what the GMs want me to see?

Alternatively, am I the asshole here?",7,1585632335,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs7489/how_to_deal_with_dms_ignoring_passive_perception/,DnD,1
fs737v,DiademDM,Dunamancy Monk Subclass,"Way of the Dunamonk

Hey guys, got this idea in the dead of night and needed to get it out there. Not all the ideas are fleshed out but let me know what you think!

Self-Adjust Density:

Starting when you take this tradition at 3rd level, as an action, you can magically alter your own weight. You can either halve or double your weight for up to 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell)

Rewind Strike:
At 3rd level, you can manipulate a moment in time while you attack. Once a turn, you can spend 1 ki point to re-roll a flurry of blows attack. You make this decision after you know whether or not the attack hits. You must use the second roll.

Gravity Training:
Accustomed to drastic changes of gravity, your body can take much more than others. At 6th level, you gain advantage in Constitution saving throws.

Extra Moment:
At 6th level, if you aren‚Äôt surprised, you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on your initiative roll.

Atmospheric Prowess:
At 11th level, your understanding and manipulation of the atmosphere around you grants you the following abilities:
	‚ÅÉ	As your movement, you can spend 1 ki point to run on air up to half your speed.
	‚ÅÉ	You have blindsight in a radius of 10ft around you.
	‚ÅÉ	You can sense if the weather in your current location will change within the next 24 hours.
	‚ÅÉ	While you are falling you add +2 to your AC.

Slowest Fall:
At 17th level, you are immune to fall damage.

Shift Between Moments:
At 17th level, as a reaction you can spend 3 ki points to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.",3,1585632194,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs737v/dunamancy_monk_subclass/,DnD,1

fs6ub5,PrinceOfMiscellany,Casting from a wizard's spell book,"So according to the PHB, a wizard can prepare spells at the end of a long rest by taking time to memorize incantations and hand maneuvers and such.

Now, shouldn't it be possible for a wizard to take a few minutes in the middle of the day to prepare some new spells?

\&gt; Fighting a bunch of normal undead as level 8s, doing fine. Got a cleric, a fighter, a wizard and a melee druid. However, we are getting overwhelmed by the seer amount of skeletons. So the cleric goes to what we can only assume is a large 20ft wide exit door in this dungeon.

DM : As this battle rages on, you walk up to the door. \*He looks probably at his notes\* Juuusst for the sake of it, roll a perception check. 

Cleric : 23! 

DM : You go up to the door and you can hear something, no, multiple somethings running to the door on the otherside. They are very large.

Cleric : Shit, I'm going to use my action and yell back to the party. ""Something else is coming!"", ""They probably brought a troll!"" (He likes making references). I'm going to then end my turn.

DM : You're within 10ft of the door, you don't want to move?

Cleric : Nah

\&gt; Fighter downs 3 zombies with the Cleaving Battle Master attack and moves to the cleric to help get advantage on anything that comes through the door

DM : The door suddenly is pounded open, the 20ft wide door swings with you two in the way. Roll a Dex Save

\&gt; Cleric nat 1, Fighter, 16. 

\&gt; Fighter passes

DM : You both go flying 30ft away and take...4d6 bludgeoning damage from the doors. Fighter you take half. Oh boy, the doors do 19 points of damage. 

Cleric : I'm down

\&gt; Party : ""WHAT"" Cleric then replies that he wasn't healing himself, fighter then replies that he's almost down himself.

DM : You see barging through these doors, 4 massive zombie ogres. Wizard what you doing

Wizard thinks for about 30 seconds and probably looking at his spells : ""Don't worry guys, I got a plan"", this mf then straight up goes, ""I'm casting dimension door out of the room"" and then says out of character with a laugh, ""Fuck this shit, I'm out""",19,1585629260,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs6gd3/bruh_im_out/,DnD,1

fs5wle,SnekAmigo,A series of mercury-themed magic items. Critiques much appreciated.," **Mercurous Whipblade**  

* Type: Weapon (shortsword/whip or dagger/whip)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted hilt and scabbard which create a blade made of pure frozen mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the blade to melt into a boiling liquid mercury whip or freeze it back into a blade. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 cold damage in its blade form and 2d6 fire damage in whip form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the whipblade has run out of charges, the hilt must be attached to the scabbard to replenish all lost charges. The scabbard contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the whipblade as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The whipblade is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. The shortsword version deals 1d6 slashing damage rather than 1d4 like a normal whip. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercurous Gunglaive**

* Type: Weapon (firearm/glaive)
* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

An enchanted iron firearm and holster which fires bullets charged with boiling liquid mercury. You can use a bonus action to allow the firearm to disassemble and extend into the shaft of a glaive with a blade made of pure frozen mercury or recompact back into a firearm. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 fire damage in its firearm form and 2d6 cold damage in glaive form. When you attack with it as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to expend up to five charges, causing pieces of mercury to break off, inflicting the poisoned condition and dealing 1d4 poison damage per charge. The weapon holds fifty charges. When the gunglaive has run out of charges, it must be attached to the holster in firearm form to replenish all lost charges. The holster contains enough mercury to recharge ten times. After the scabbard runs out of mercury, you can roll a d20 to try to use the gunglaive as if it still has one charge. On a 1 or a 20 the bonus action succeeds, and on any other roll it fails and takes a permanent -1 from all attack and damage rolls. The gunglaive is destroyed if it falls to a -5 from attack and damage rolls. In firearm form the gunglaive deals 1d10 piercing damage, a normal range of 150 feet and a long range of 375 feet, 25 shots, and the Burst Fire property. It is compatible with modern or renaissance bullets. Its glaive form lacks the Two-Handed property and has the Thrown property rather than the Heavy property with a normal range of 15 feet and a long range of 75 feet. You can use an action to summon it back to you as long as you still have the holster. Both forms have the Versatile property. If you are proficient with one form but not the other, you become proficient with both.

**Mercury Capsule**

* Type: Wondrous Item
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A capsule of mercury which comes in two variants, one which serves as a refill for the scabbard or holster of a mercurous whipblade or a mercurous gunglaive which holds enough mercury for one hundred charges and can not be used until all remaining charges in the scabbard or holster are depleted, and one which is meant to be attached to a mercury-charged weapon or can use the capsule to coat the blade of a weapon as an action. The weapon must deal slashing or piercing damage. A weapon which deals bludgeoning damage is not eligible for this. This expends one charge and causes the weapon to deal an extra 1d4 poison damage for one minute. This applies to both melee and ranged weapons. 

**Mercury-Charged Melee Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any melee weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to leak through the grooves on the blade to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. If you do not replace the mercury capsule after it runs out of charges, you lose the plus one bonus after 1d6 hours and the 1d4 poison damage after 1d10 hours. All penalties are reset when you attach a new capsule. You can take a standard weapon to a blacksmith to have it modified into a mercury-charged weapon for  350 GP. You must also provide one mercury capsule and 25 GP worth of iron ore or whatever other material is applicable. Only weapons which exclusively deal piercing or slashing damage can be made into mercury-charged weapons. Weapons which deal bludgeoning damage are not eligible for this, nore are weapons which already have some additional features beyond their standard version other than silvered or adamantine weapons.     

**Mercury-Charged Ranged Weapon**

* Type: Weapon (any ranged weapons)
* Rarity: Uncommon
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A modified weapon which can have a mercury capsule attached to it. When you take the Attack action with this weapon, you have a plus 1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deal an extra 1d4 poison damage. As a bonus action you can hold down the trigger attached to the mercury capsule, expending a charge to allow enough mercury to coat the tip of your ammo to deal an additional 1d8 poison damage. If you do not replace the mercury capsule after it runs out of charges, you lose the plus one bonus after 1d6 hours and the 1d4 poison damage after 1d10 hours.

fs5t3x,NoCoffeeNoThink,Searching for non-combat player roles aboard ships,"There's a wealth of resources for ship to ship combat, and even some good stuff on events in the sea. There's nothing about crew, aside from a list of what they are. Looking at Ghosts of Saltmarsh, it's said that crew has a quality score and that it goes down with poor morale. And that's all. It lists officer positions, and a few special cases where a player officer would roll dice, and that's all.

So, here's how it come across:

Everyone at the table sits there bored while the captain player moves the ship around the map. Or, perhaps, the ship is besieged by endless, high-frequency attacks and events from the moment the party leaves port. Insofar as actually playing the role of officers, the other players don't. They just wait. There's also something about morale and a crew quality score, but that's really the DM making up whatever on the fly. Neither really exist, game-mechanic-wise.

I've searched for anything that would get the players.. well, playing, in terms of running the ship outside of combat, and aside from a few rolls and roleplay during events. Why does everything fall to just the one player who assumes the role of captain?

fs5r1w,blargablargh,[Dark Sun] Arcane Defiling and a Defiler subclass for Wizards [OC],"Hi all, I homebrewed some rules for Arcane Defiling to use in a Dark Sun campaign. It's a weird mechanic, but then again everything is weird in Dark Sun. Your thoughts are appreciated!

**Arcane Defiling**  
**Corruption:** You have a Corruption Threshold equal to your Wisdom and Charisma scores added together. Corruption Points are accumulated every time you use Arcane Defiling. When your Corruption Points equal or exceed your Corruption Threshold, your Constitution score is permanently reduced by one point, and your Corruption Points reset to zero. Your Corruption Points decrease by one after a long rest.

**Preserving:** When you cast a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can remove 1d4-1 Corruption Points from yourself or from another creature within 10 feet of you.

**Defiling:** When you cast a Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you may choose to Defile. Every living creature (except you) in a 10-foot radius around you takes necrotic damage equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. You also gain Corruption points equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast the spell.

**The Defiler** (Arcane Tradition)  
**Dreaded Reputation**  
Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, you become proficient in the Intimidation skill, if you aren't already.

**Control Defiling**  
Starting at 2nd level, when you use Arcane Defiling, you may choose a number of creatures in the area equal to your Intelligence modifier. These creatures are not damaged by your Defiling. Additionally, if a living creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the damage from your Arcane Defiling, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of 1).

**Scour the Land**  
Starting at 6th level, you may enhance the power of your Arcane Defiling. The radius of your arcane defiling increases to 20 feet, and the damage dealt to all creatures in that radius increases to 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell slot used to cast the spell. Afterward, no defiling can be used for one month per level of the spell slot used in the area you have defiled.

Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Walking Wasteland**  
Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage and you add your Wizard level to your Corruption Threshold. You now only lose Corruption Points at a rate of one per week.

If you cast a concentration spell using Arcane Defiling, you can continue to inflict the damage dealt by your Defiling at the beginning of your turn each round that you maintain concentration. You continue to accumulate Corruption Points equal to the level of the spell slot used each round you maintain concentration in this way.

**Siphon Energy**  
Starting at 14th level, you may use your Arcane Defiling to draw even more magic from the parched land, though the cost is steep. When you Defile using a spell slot of 3rd level or lower, you may voluntarily suffer an additional 1d6+1 Corruption Points. You recover the spell slot as soon as the spell is cast. You may do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You regain all spent uses of this ability after a long rest.",3,1585626212,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs5r1w/dark_sun_arcane_defiling_and_a_defiler_subclass/,DnD,1

fs5fsb,Joy_to_the_Fandom,Slave to the Rhythm (Need Advice),"DM here. I'm putting together a 1920's style mystery campaign (will need advice for that, too), and one of my proposed players approached me with an interesting backstory for her character. 

She is playing a warlock (race TBD) who sold her soul to a record label for fame/a beautiful singing voice. I though it was SUPER fun, so I agreed. However, I'm running into a bit of trouble of thinking how this would impact the game. 

On one hand, there have to be consequences for selling your soul. This typically includes eternal damnation after death, but the afterlife doesn't really apply when a character pretty much stops existing when the player is finished with them. Thus, it would make sense for an active consequence while she is alive.

On the other hand, I don't want to consequences to be so that she regrets building her backstory. It is, after all, a backstory and not a spur-of-the-moment, chaotic in-game moment. She will still be able to be revived and healed. Perhaps she is not allowed to marry so she can focus on her work? Maybe her arm is covered in horrific tattoos that mark her as ""soulless""?

fs564y,Gattatok,Request for advice.,"TL;DR - I custom-tailored World of Warcraft content for my group's power levels, but I feel cheap for not coming up with original content after a player's mocking. 

Hello, I've been running a dnd game for the past 3-4 years. My group of players are playing 2 groups in the same world (forgotten realms, 5e) and when I was younger and less experienced, I gave them some powerful magic items that fit each character theme and scaled with their level. This isn't a problem in itself, but coupled with the fact that there are 6 characters in each group, Challenge Ratings are pretty much useless.

Cut to the current conundrum: the two groups are currently level 16-17,and I want to get them to 20 before they fight the (not quite) final boss, but in running out of ideas for dungeons, so I turn to popular media, namely World of Warcraft. There are several dungeons in there that fit my designs perfectly, have interesting fight mechanics, and that the 2 players that have played Wow haven't actually done yet.

So, since I can't exactly use challenge ratings, I'm having to custom tailor each of these fights to offer a challenge without going overboard. We ran through the first dungeon, and it went even better than I could have hoped. Fantastic challenge to the players, a legitimate threat to them (even at their increased power levels), and interesting rp mixed in.

The problem? One of the players realized the dungeon was from WoW, and has not stopped giving me flak about it. Constantly calling me out for putting WoW stuff in the game and such.

I know this player, and I know he's saying it teasingly and doesn't mean any ill will towards me, but I still feel cheap for not coming up with my own dungeon.

Am I going about this the wrong way?",3,1585623765,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs564y/request_for_advice/,DnD,1
fs562d,UndeadPriest94,Kobold Eggs: Farming-Worthy?,"I've been working around the idea of running a ""kobold"" farm in a game, where I have kobolds lay eggs like chickens. However, this comes to a big question: how feasible is it to make a kobold egg farm?

I've read a bit on kobold physiology through various sources, and with it I got that they lay hard-shell eggs and they lay eggs at a fairly rapid rate compared to the rate of reproduction of other humanoids. In addition, based on their size being greater than that of chickens, their eggs are likely greater in size. I do recognize the biggest problem, in that it takes 2 weeks for a kobold to lay an egg, compared to a chicken's 1 ^(1)/2 to 2 day rate. However, like chickens, I suspect a better diet would improve their rate of egg-laying (kobolds do live in squalor and have to live off any food they can find, which likely affects their rate and quality of egg-laying).

The bigger questions remain, though: can kobolds lay eggs without fertilization, and are kobold eggs edible? I haven't found any information on these factors. Is there any hidden lore about kobolds that answers these questions?",11,1585623755,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs562d/kobold_eggs_farmingworthy/,DnD,1

\&gt; The weapon can be drawn without an action as it flies into the hand of the attuned with a simple flick of the wrist.  
\&gt; The weapon can be recalled to the hand of the owner by verbally calling it, the blade will return at a speed of 30 ft. per round.

fs4sxv,Emersonson,Carrying Capacity Question,"For no particular reason I was hoping that someone could check my math on what I think is the maximum carrying capacity that a single player character could achieve. 

Race: Warforged (Juggernaut) or Goliath

Class: at least 3 levels as a Rune Knight; at least 6 levels as a Barbarian (Path of the Totem); 

Strength: 20

Modifier: Enlarge spell

So to start, with 20 strength (I'm assuming to be the max) you have a base carrying capacity of 300 pounds. Now we start applying the modifiers. First, taking 6 levels as a Path of the Totem Barbarian lets you take the second Bear Totem ability and double your carrying capacity (300 x 2 = 600). Second, the Rune Knight is able to invoke the ""Giant Might"" ability at level three to grow to ""large"" size for  a brief period (bringing the modifier to x4). For every size level a creature gains they are able to carry twice as much. Third, if someone then casts Enlarge (immediately doubles willing creature's size and bumps you up a size category) you can get up to ""Huge"" size (x8 modifier). Finally, Warforged Juggernauts and Goliaths both have a racial feature where they can lift as if they were a size larger, bringing the final modifier to x16. This leaves you with a player character able to carry 4,800 pounds (300 x 16) or push, drag, or lift up to 9,600 pounds (since you can push, drag, or lift up to twice your carrying capacity).

My advice is to give vague yet consise detail on the souroundings be it smells, the way the wind moves through the grass, the view from the mountain top and how you can just barely make out the clock tower of a town just over the peak of another hill, make it vague but not mysterious and let the players imagination fill in the blank areas",0,1585618613,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs3uyx/response_to_the_breath_of_the_wild_guy/,DnD,1
fs3qyg,LunarianCecil,Is there any indepth guide on Bladesinger Wizard?,"So ive recently seen a post regarding Bladesinger, and the class sounds suuuuuper fun and exactly like the type of class ive been trying to create since ive started playing D&amp;D late last year.

Ive tried searching through this sub via keyword 'Bladesinger' but only found some useful comments, but no real indepth guide on them. I know in those comments ive seen people that have said they loooove bladesinger and its their fave subclass, and figured maybe making a post would be able to get some help on the topic.

Any Links, comments, would be super helpful, and if your a bladesinger lover dont be afraid to just leave a loong comment if you want or to DM me.

fs3pe6,Argus-Wanderfoot,Allies with Mindflayers?!?,"So I am the type of DM who likes to subvert expectations every once in a while and luckily, my party is generally thoughtful, non-murderhobos so it works out. 

So I got this idea of introducing the party to a clutch of Mindflayers but I don't want them to be immediately hostile. Maybe they want help from the party, maybe they are just peaceful creatures who want to be left alone. Or maybe they just seem like they are allies to gain control over the party. But the point is I want the party to be initially scared by them, then be forced to work with them then come to trust them and then I'll make a decision to either have the flayers betray the party or thank them and send them on their way. 

My question is do you folks have any ideas for solid pretexts of situations where a party may have to work with a mindflayer or a group of Mindflayers? I've only ever seen them used as cultists of Old Ones and as per evil. Do they have hopes and dreams of their own. Are there any instances where they maybe overthrow the Big Brains and throw in their lot with our heroes?",7,1585618023,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs3pe6/allies_with_mindflayers/,DnD,1
fs3ozm,DaBobLawBlah,"Feeling left out, and all I want to do is play some D&amp;D with friends...but they're disorganized &amp; flakey.","The last week or so I've been feeling super depressed about D&amp;D. A friend of mine recently started looking for people interested in playing. He formed two separate parties, and plans to DM for them both. I'm part of group 2, but basically all of my friends are in group 1. I don't know anybody in group 2. I've asked if I could instead play with group 1, but it's at capacity, and the DM won't let anyone else join it. 

Though that adds to it, that's not my real problem. The actual issue is that group 2 is being flakey, disorganized, and we can't seem to coalesce on any plan. Group 1 has already had a few sessions...and we can't even get characters ready, let alone an entire game. In response to this, I've been incredibly patient and helpful to the DM. Trying to give them suggestions on how to organize the group and get a game plan, literally and metaphorically, into action. After all, at this point it's beginning to feel like it's just a tease.

I don't know what else to do about this, other than be patient or just back away. It's depressing because I keep hearing how much fun these games are for group 1, and yet I'm not getting any action. Even though I was the first in either group to have everything ready to go. Literally, I had 5 character sheets ready to play before anyone else had theirs finished.

Can anyone else identify with this problem? üòì",16,1585617979,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs3ozm/feeling_left_out_and_all_i_want_to_do_is_play/,DnD,1

fs35bk,Lessiy,Using different character voices,"Hey everyone,
So I've been playing d&amp;d for about 2 years now and I have never done a special voice for my player character. I always use my normal voice. Mostly because I feel like the characters that I make represent me in one way or another, so I find it hard to imagine the character having another voice, but on the other hand, I do really want to do some kind of voice for more involvement and a somewhat deeper connection with my character if that makes sense. From time to time I do try something when I'm alone but never with great succes. Also, I feel like I can manipulate my voice way better in English than in my native language (Dutch). But because everyones native language is Dutch, we play to game with Dutch voices. I find it really hard to get some kind of accent flowing or change my way of speakin entirely.
Now in those two years, I have done some voices for NPC's when I was the DM. I could do those pretty good and they were really interesting, but they were taking their toll on my throat and I don't think i can do such voices for my player characters.

My question is: how did you guys start doing voices for your character? Do you even use voices, of do you feel the same about voices as I do? Any tips? Im really curious so let me know!",8,1585615894,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs35bk/using_different_character_voices/,DnD,1

I'm starting a new wrestling themed campaign and I was wondering if anyone might have some fun encounter/ puzzle/ ideas!

The elevator pitch of this game is that the world is essentially a technicolor fantasy world dialed up to 11, and one of the most popular forms of entertainment is wrestling. Except here, it's not fake, you'll actually see an undead wizard and his half demon brother fight.

The party is a faction on a developmental promotion looking to train and level up, with the end game of the campaign being the trials of mount fightlympus, to essentially take their place among the wrestling gods.

I wanna try and make the campaign have legs so it's not all just grappling battles in a ring, so would love any ideas or advice anyone has.

Thanks!",4,1585615719,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs33o0/creating_a_wrestling_themed_campaign_any_advice/,DnD,1

Warning, this may contain minor spoilers.

Getting right to the point, the text labels things with a C and M notation in the text, but the maps are not labeled C or M; I'm assuming that C is City and M is monastery. But I am quite confused if that is even the case. Both start on a cliff side outcropping which is not helpful, the ferry service is labeled under C3, but it goes to the monastery, but it's under C, and 3 on the monastery map is a building in the center of the floating island. 3 on the city map is right under where the party pops out of the caverns, but has no depiction of a ferry service of any kind; it's just in the middle of a pool of ooze.  


I'm really lost. I apologize if even my question does not make sense, I'm not even sure if the floating island is directly above the ooze city or not. Am I the only one who is this confused as to how these maps are to be interpreted?  


Is the floating city above the ooze city?  
Which map does the C and the M areas correspond too?

fs1n1n,ALonelyPug,The Joking Skull Riddle,"I was bored so I made a (hopefully) simple riddle. It goes like this:

You enter a room with a closed stone door across from you at the end of the room. A skull sits upon a square, stone table in the middle of the room. The skull is clearly magical and animated, with glowing dots in it's eye sockets, and jokes constantly coming out of it's mouth. No matter how the skull is looked at, it will always seem as if it is sad, and it's mouth always somehow looks as if it is frowning. (When the players approach the skull, the skull will start making jokes, often ones that are crude lies about the PCs) The stone table upon which the skull sits has an epitaph about the skull's life on the northern side of the square table that says,

*""In life and now I was the funniest man in all the land, preforming in castles that were oh, so grand! I lied, joked, and made many a jeer. By a king's side, I was always near. I caused many a hearty laugh with my jokes and funny tricks, balancing on wires and juggling bricks! But then one day, I made a jeer too bold, angering a powerful wizard, of times gone and old. His temper flared, I was struck down. And forced to be here, with an eternal frown.""*

If the players read the epitaph, the skull asks, *""What am I?""* in a confused, questioning tone. The skull remembers none of it's past, and cannot answer any questions about it, nor can it divulge any information about the riddle. After the skull asks *""what am I?""*, a piece of parchment, an inkwell, and a feather pen magically appear a few seconds later in front of the skull. When these items appear, the skull says, *""My ears aren't what they used to be. Please write down what I am on this parchment.""*. To solve the riddle, the PCs must write down what the skull is: a liar. Why is the skull a liar? Well the important parts of the epitaph are the phrases *""In life and now""* and *""I lied, joked, and made many a jeer.""*. These essentially say, in life I was a liar, and I still am. In fact, everything written on the epitaph is a lie, except for the fact that the skull lied in life, which is true. I put the fact that he lied in life before everything else to try and subtly say the skull is a liar, as to make the answer less obvious. If a PC writes down a wrong answer, they take 3d4 fire damage, as the ink that was used to write the incorrect answer bursts into flames, scorching the PC that wrote the incorrect answer. (The paper stays intact, despite the flames.)

TLDR: Riddle about a skull's life, answer to the riddle is ""a liar"" or anything similar to that answer.

Feel free to use this in a game or modify it for use in a game, it is totally fine.",17,1585610397,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fs1n1n/the_joking_skull_riddle/,DnD,1
fs1lz6,Owalover,One of my players just attuned to the Wand of Orcus,"A little context.

The Wand of Orcus has been dropped randomly into the Material plane by Orcus again (he does that on occasion, did some lore checking on it). One of my players is a warlock, their powers coming from Graz'zt, another demon lord. Graz'zt contacted her and told her to bring it to him, and that it was nearby. Simply said it was nearby, she's resourceful enough to find it (he was having trouble pinpointing it due to anti-divination magic, but he didn't say that), and it was in the clutches of a cult.

The cult, it turned out, was a group of people who were actually looking to destroy it in some way. They were made up of a group of about 12 dwarves (their clan was destroyed by Mind Flayers, they were roaming the underdark previously until their services were requested), 2 Paladins of Kelemvor, 2 Priests of Lathander, 3 drow, and an older human male that everyone seemed to respect due to his leadership in bringing everyone together. Everyone else in the group brought here due to information from their respective deities wanting the item destroyed, or at least locked away.

The older human is a Cambion in disguise, an offspring of Graz'zt that is attempting to return the Wand to his ""father"" in a power grab against his other siblings (it's how Graz'zt knew about it in the first place). 

Everything here is very politically charged, but the ""human"" has been able to keep everyone from killing each other, as this would make his life difficult because of their location.

Shorter story, party arrives, integrates, monk in the party decides to hold the Wand. Now, in the official description of the Wand, it says that the sentient mind inside of it is cold and calculating, but I felt that my players were much to smart for the ""I'll give you power to kill Orcus, or your enemies, or whatever"" to bother trying anything like attuning to it. So, I gave it the voice and mannerisms of a little kid. It talked to the monk, telling him that it didn't remember who it really was, and that it hated the fact that it held so much evil. It was willing to help the monk in whatever way he wished, whether it meant killing Orcus, or destroying the Wand. All an intelligent ploy by the Wand to work against this good aligned character that was holding it.

The ploy worked.

The monk attempted to attune to the item, and made his save. For anyone who doesn't know, failing the save is instant death. A success is 10d6 necrotic damage. I gave plenty of foreshadowing to the players about the evil emanating from this thing. Even had it kill the youngest dwarf in the clan, whom they'd had previous amusing interactions with, in front of one of the PC's. The young dwarf had also been tricked into attuning to it.

Now, i'm trying to decide where to take it. Graz'zt wants the Wand, the other members of the little ""cult"" want to destroy it, the warlock is VERY torn (in and out of character) about whether to take it to her patron so she can keep her powers, or if she should attempt to have it destroyed. 

I'm happy with the results as they currently are, I'm just having a bit of a writer's shlump.

fs0vmu,DragonbeardNick,"Professional DMing, Why I think the hobby should start paying DMs more","So I posted an ad over on r/lfgpremium ([https://imgur.com/gallery/HgVue1H/comment/1831190303](https://imgur.com/gallery/HgVue1H/comment/1831190303)) but I wanted to open up a broader discussion on the topic of paying money to play Dungeons and Dragons. It seems like such a weird taboo. I think that it should be more commonly accepted to pay DMs. 

Now when I play with my friends, or DM for them, I don't expect payment and I don't pay my DM. However, when we played in person I never expected the DM to pay for food for the night, and both in person and online our group likes to pool money and buy gifts (minis, books, dice etc) for the DM.

However, it seems like when you say ""I will run a game for this group of strangers, but I will need my time compensated,"" players are shocked. ""You should DM for the fun of it!"" And yes, DMing is fun, but time consuming and expensive. It seems that the expectation generally is that DMs should spend all their free time creating an immersive world, designing encounters, creating terrain, etc and then a bunch of their own money buying books, miniatures, and software (especially now).

Essentially it seems that players perceive D&amp;D as free, but its only free to them. DMs have to pay into each session with both their time and money. What do you all think? Is this fair?

The Corpse Flower is a Large animated plant that grows from the ground in which the corpse of an evil necromancer or powerful undead has been buried.

I have extensively researched because I love the game even with how little I've been playing, but I've been having trouble with my group for various reasons.
My main issue right now is that I don't really know how to create a good dnd character, I'm used to creating characters for books or stories but they don't seem to be working here and it's making me feel incredibly bad. Ive had two of my characters dismantled and denied by the group and I spent a week on each of them.

frzm1h,maplenewt-goodies,Advice on a slightly homebrewed character? [5e],"Like many people these days, I recently started up a quarantine campaign. One of my players came to me with a really interesting character idea- so interesting that I decided to let her run with it. However, I am a new DM, and I'm not sure if this character is going to be broken down the line. The last thing I want is for the other players to feel like I was playing favorites, so if you guys wouldn't mind, could I get some feedback?

The premise of the character is that it's a dybbuk possessing the corpse of a child. The campaign takes place in Eberron, and the child was killed during the Mourning. The dybbuk possessed the body, but found it felt guilty when it saw how happy the parents were to see their child ""alive."" Afraid it would not be able to properly imitate the child's behavior, it ran away.

Mechanically, she is a ""human"" wizard, with a penalty to Charisma because, well, she's a corpse. The dybbuk preserves the corpse just enough to make it appear alive, but I figured there would probably still be something unsettling (she doesn't breathe, etc) that people would subconsciously pick up on. HP is treated as the wear and tear on the corpse- at 0 the dybbuk is ejected from it's vessel. Death saves, in this instance, are the dybbuk's attempts to undo enough damage to get the corpse moving again, and failed saves mean that it's been damaged beyond repair, and the dybbuk needs to find a new body.

After talking it over, we also decided that healing spells and such wouldn't work on her, though potions might (since it's a chemical reaction instead of magic trying to affect a life force that isn't there). Instead, she has the Mending cantrip, which she can cast on her body as a first level spell and it will function like Cure Wounds.

That's about the extent of it so far. I want to flesh out more of what happens when her dybbuk form is out in the open, but before I do, I want to know if this is at all unbalanced, so I can try and fix it. We've only played one session so far, and she came awfully close to reaching 0, so I want to make sure I have mechanics ready for if/when that happens.

frz3q9,KitsunaKuraichi,Changed plans for my players. How to handle travel?,"Due to the chaos recently I pushed back a mission the players were going to go on in game. I gave them the choice beforehand because we are down a player that was going to lead the mission. They all agreed to push back the mission because they wanted the other player to be their. Plus we got a new (but veteran) player to the group.

Now they are traveling to the top of the continent by horse drawn wagon for 3 and a half to 3 weeks to get to a port town and get to another continent for their mission.

About 4 or 5 hours into the journey my 3 players were attacked by a creature that they killed and then we stopped for the night.

Problem is that I know travel is really boring in DnD. The party has a sorcerer, druid, and ranger that has favored terrain in this area.

Fiends and other creatures have been sighted in the area.

I don't want to just say they travel for X amount of hours, make a survival check, encounter Y, and then rest. Rinse and repeat.

How do I make travel interesting? They are on a time sensitive mission if that matters.

I am a DM and I consider myself to be an okay, if inexperienced dm. Ive only run a couple of sessions (3 to be exact) and a one shot. I dont consider myself to be a SUPER sensitive person but almost every time ive dmed it left me crying after everyone left and im ready to quit. The first session of my first campaign was actually great! It went really well and everyone was getting excited. second session was... okay? at best. I felt as if I didint have them as interested in the game but it was passable. I felt on the verge of tears the entire time. The third session was a complete disaster. I didnt feel like I could say no to them. ALL of my players have 18+ charisma scores and they all set their mind on seducing some gaurds. They did so with nat 20s on two of them and a nat 18 from another they decided that they wanted to take them with them on the journey and ended up dragging them along. This was the point at which I decided that I should say no. Then they hit me with the ""oh come on it will be fun"" and begged me to let it slide And I thought that i would just give them some consequences in the future although I wasint happy about the way I handled it. I felt as if i had no control over the story and i was pretty upset and lost alot of motivation. Now the one shot. the one shot. my last straw. I spent all day prepping a cool high level pirate one shot for my players, who were a gunslinger, a sorcerer and a monk. It was going really smoothly and really well! I was stoked. Until halfway through we met a (intentionally) hard dilemma. one of the three had to give up their eyes in order to continue their quest. This was the point where the gunslinger decided he would rather die than give up his eyes. So he killed himself. I was annoyed but granted not surprised. so I said that he wakes up with one hit point and blind. Because freaky black magic reasons.  What my players didint know was that it was all an illusion that the island itself created to scare them off. It would be revealed if they waited literally a couple of minuets until the blindness effect on the gunslingeer that killed himself ended. But instead, sorcerer stabs the blind gunslinger, casts fly on himself, and then flies out to the ocean and drowns himself. Then I was saying that ""no you cant do that that not fair."" and he says ""well im leaving anyways its getting late. bye."" and LEAVES THE CALL. IT WAS 10:00 AT NIGHT WE HAD ONLY BEEN PLAYING FOR AN HOUR. We all have no idea what to do so we decide that we will continue this later. We text in the groupchat wondering when we are going to meet to finish this and the player that ruined the game said ""oh I thought this was a one time thing. Im not going to meet again I dont want to make a practice of it."" at this point im fuming and so done. Then the following conversation occurs over the next few days. Now I realize that I might not have handled this in the best way. I was angry and hurt that this all had happened.

frx8lm,Bagam_the_Animator,Goblin Be-gone!,"A Scarred thug named Ancis Ammes holds a shackled up goblin by an iron chain in front of a crowd.

The party can roll perception (DC 10). If they succeed they notice that the goblin is pretty beat up and seems to wince whenever the man waves it's arm towards him.

Ancis explains that he developed a special potion that repels goblins. He holds the potion in one hand and shows it to the crowd.

Then he opens the potion bottle and spills some of the liquid on the goblin. The goblin then drops on the ground as if unconscious.

The party can roll perception again (DC 17) If they succeed they notice the goblin only fell unconscious after noticing the stern look Ancis gave him.

The crowd then makes one loud ""Awe!"", as they are amazed of the potion's special effect.

Ancis then explains that a single verbal command will make the goblin wake up again, ""Tripolya!"".As he finishes saying the word, the goblin wakes up and stands on it's feet again.

The crows makes another loud ""Awe!"".

Ancis then announces that he offers the potion for only 1 GP a bottle. The crowd then gathers around offering to buy the potion, several people even taking two.

The party can also buy a potion. If they buy a bottle, they see that the liquid inside looks strangely like normal water. A detect magic or identify spell confirms it is indeed, plain water.

The crowd then disappears. Ancis walks to his house with a heavy bag of gold, pulling the poor goblin behind him by the chain.

The party can confront Ancis and threaten to expose his scam (DC 15 Intimidation). If they succeed, Ancis offers to share half his earnings in exchange for their silence. (50 GP)

If they fail the intimidation check, Ancis becomes aggressive and tells them they can't prove anything. 

The party can prove Ancis is a scammer by using magical means like identify or detect magic on the potion, this proves it's nothing but water. They can threaten to show this to the authorities.

If they do, Ancis offers them half of his earnings in exchange for their silence as if they succeeded in the intimidation check.

Should they refuse his offer and demand that he confesses, Ancis attacks.

\------

Ancis stats:

AC: 14

HP: 50

Club: Attack Bonus +3, 1d4+2.

\------

When Ancis's health drops below 15, he loses his grip on the chain that holds the goblin. The goblin wiggles free and quickly makes a run for it. He runs in to one of the town's people, the man quickly produces the bottle he purchased from Ancis and sprinkles on the goblin some of the liquid. To his surprise, the goblin is not affected at all. 

The goblin then lunges at the man, pushing him aside and runs out of town. Several other people see this and gather around the party and Ancis.

They demand their gold back, calling Ancis a scammer and a cheat.

Ancis confesses that it was a lie and offers the money back, begging for mercy from the town people. 

Two guards show up and take him away.

frx0w6,goblingonads,Arms Master: Wanted to create a Battle Master lite‚Ñ¢ that focuses on making the most of all types of weapons. Decided to reskin an existing homebrew instead of starting from scratch. C&amp;C welcome!,"[Arms Master first draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dYipVQhZst0SV2RSVxhD739grundA3RWhN-qiyTZvZE/edit?usp=sharing)

Never done this sort of thing before so please comment and criticize harshly but fairly. The work of the original homebrew by knight5000, called the Master-at-Arms, can be found on [DNDbeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/486-master-at-arms).

It's worth noting that I adjusted the flavor of this homebrew martial archetype to fit a specific campaign, and the mileage of this subclass would invariably vary depending on your campaign. I run  campaign for one player, and one player only, who has a limit of 2 low-power companions, so it's reflavored with that in mind.

The power and flavor of abilities are reminiscent of the Battle Master intentionally, as they are meant to be tactical options similar to Maneuvers that don't clog combat as much as the Battle Master\*. To do this, the original creator, knight5000, removed the need for superiority dice by making the ""maneuvers"" weaker and more passive, however limiting the class to one specific fighting style: dual-wielding. I did not find this flavor to suit my tastes and felt that it locked you into selecting certain feats and fighting styles, and didn't give the impression of a ""master"" so much as it did a ""specialist.""

The archetype was initially founded on two key parts: weapon damage type and two-weapon fighting. My take on the design was to really highlight the ""master"" portion of its name, and allowing the archetype to, at max level, excel at every melee weapon type.  To do this, I had to remove the two-weapon theme entirely, and focus on a broader range of weaponry to fit the theme of the class.

I have expanded this archetype to have a more solid foundation, based on two broad aspects: weapon damage type and weapon style. What this means is that the archetype functions based on whether you are wielding a piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing weapon; and whether you are assuming a one-handed weapon style (no off-hand, including shields), a two-weapon style, or a two-handed weapon style. This has allowed for a more defined behavior of the class, in my opinion.

Again, any comments and criticisms are welcomed, and please be harsh but fair.

\*This is my opinion on the class.",0,1585595345,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frx0w6/arms_master_wanted_to_create_a_battle_master_lite/,DnD,1

I'm undertaking an attempt to convert Pathfinder's Kingmaker AP to 5e. (Yes, I know they announced that they would be releasing such a conversion themselves, but honestly, why pay more money?)

The one thing I'm having trouble working out is how gold transfers across. Magic items in 5e are a lot less prevalent (and powerful), and some of the quests they have here offer first tier groups up to 800GP for one quest. 

How would you convert the gold reward into 5th Editions reward structure?",1,1585594774,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frwtwl/kingmaker_conversion_to_5e/,DnD,1

frvu56,kr1mz0n,"Need help defining some ""Relics of Destiny""","So, i've been running a 5e game for a while that began with the PCs being part of a caravan that was exiled from the ""civilized"" world by an evil usurper (who was prophesied to become a god.)  When the campaign started, the caravan had found a city that was, according to the NPC spiritual leader, a significant place to gather certain items that would allow for the defeat of the usurper.  There were seventeen items spread out across the map that they would have to collect.

OOC this was meant to be an episodic game, where there was a huge map, i put 17 stars out there and numbered them.  That way, in a meta-game way, the PC's would know where to go for the adventure (which were level appropriate for the # on the star).   So I provided them the names of the items at the stars... but never really decided what the relics would do.

Fast forward a long time (today) and I've put things in motion where they are actually going to be going into a large scale combat with a neighboring area, and they realize they might need to use some of these items (the ones that haven't been stolen by an NPC traitors).  Surprisingly, they never really asked for the properties of the relics before - but suddenly they're all ""what does this actually do?""

So - i'm coming here for help!  What should these things do?  I'm thinking things like 1/long rest powers or effects.

&amp;#x200B;

Level 3\* Copper Knife - This was found in a cave with a coven of Hags :: The PC's have this one

Level 4\* Amulet - 1) needs a cooler name, 2) was found in an Orc village :: The PC's lost this one

Level 5\* Soul Gem - There were Cambions trapped in the gem, and when it was found, the adults of a village had been trapped within it. :: The PC's lost this one

Level 6\* 3 Glass Orbs - The lizardmen of the village where they found it said that each could be thrown to destroy an army (grenade style)... of course, this is what the lizardmen thought, but they hadn't used them. :: The PC's have this one

Level 7\* Bowl of Blood - found in the loot of a green dragon :: The PC's lost this one

Level 8\* Waterfall of Silver - actually it's 300 pieces of Electrum pieces. :: The PC's lost this one

Level 9\* Black Mantle - :: The PC's haven't found this one yet

Level 10\* Bone Flute - Has some necromancy power - I think I might have hinted it would allow the casting of a second concentration spell, but would do damage to the whole party every round. :: The PCs have this one

Level 11\* Necklace of Teeth - found in a dream world - the teeth are dragon teeth :: The PCs have this one

Level 12\* Ephemeral Shawl - It's actually a Torc, and gives advantages with and against illusions :: The PCs have this one

Level 13\* Driftwood Staff :: The PC's haven't found this one yet

frvddx,Padengeg,[5e] Fighter : Two-Weapon Fighting¬¥s Hit and Damage Calculation,"Hey,

just a quick question because I¬¥m kind of confused about all the ""Bonus Action"" stuff.  


So I¬¥m playing a **fighter** having the ""**Two-Weapon Fighting**"" (PHB 72) fighting style.  
My weapons are 2 sickles (1d6) with the light attribute.  
My STR is at 18 (+4) resulting in a +6 Bonus on Attack rolls after adding proficiency bonus.  


When rolling for attacks, does my process work like this?:  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ACTION**  
Roll for Attack  -&gt; d20 + 6   
If this hits, 1d6 + 4 (Str Modifier)   


**BONUS ACTION**  
Another roll for Attack -&gt; d20 + 6 (since my fighting Style allows to add modifiers on dual wielding bonus actions)  
If this hits, 1d6 + 4 (see above)   
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Is this correct? It seems like quite alot of damage in comparison to my other party members, and I feel like I¬¥m doing it wrong, but the PHB just describes *WHEN* a Bonus Action is possible and not *how* it works.  
Or is the error that I¬¥m using the ""Fighting Style"" in a wron manner?  


Sorry for this mundane question, I¬¥m pretty new to this game.",12,1585590182,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frvddx/5e_fighter_twoweapon_fightings_hit_and_damage/,DnD,1

Costs one spell slot of any kind,

It can pick up anything within 60 feet that weighs between 1-5 pounds,

It launches that object in a straight line for 90 feet, 

It requires a failed dex save to hit, 

And at higher levels you can lift 5 pounds more with each level. 

Now here‚Äôs where the potential comes in: it says any object under 5 pounds. You can launch stuff like alchemist fire, gold pouches, messages if you put a rock on it. 

And if that doesn‚Äôt satisfy you, let me introduce you to my new DnD invention, the Double javelin : simply tie two javelins together with rope, drop it on the ground, and it‚Äôs ready to use.

fruf3n,Bite-Size-Ewan,My broken bridge puzzle.,"The party can find themselves in anywhere you wish, as long as these things apply; there is something that needs to be reverted to youth for the party to continue, there are clues in the form of skeletons in a village and there is the wordplay I use. These things can be adapted to an extent.

The players come across a collection of stone tablets or runes in a village, carved into them a message conveying this: Our village (or other community) have struggled to fight the changing times/ attacks/ curse of the land, and we are not able to survive for long. But we have come across a spell that can revert anything to youth with the sacrifice of a living creature into the flames and the words ‚ÄòPuer natus est‚Äô (meaning, and tell the party, youth to the old) spoken.

The party can conclude that the spell failed, as the village is dead, all skeletons, and it didn‚Äôt work for them. The ‚ÄòYouth to the old‚Äô in the spell means to convert the youth INTO the old, therefore the spell killed the villagers which attempted it as they all became instantly aged into skeletons. 

In the campaign it can be a broken bridge: the party has to work to reverse the spell by tossing the DEAD into the fire and saying the reverse of the spell: ‚ÄòNatus puer est‚Äô and reverting the destroyed bridge into a fixed one, it‚Äôs old state. They can then continue on as they were.",4,1585587164,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fruf3n/my_broken_bridge_puzzle/,DnD,1

fru3ru,LimeLine131,"DND players of reddit, what is the best backstory you or someone else has come up with for a character/ campaign?","I‚Äôm joining a campaign this summer with a bunch of friends and our DM wanted for us to make lord based characters for the campaign. Me being a book writer and a character designer of 9+ years I was happy to deliver.

 I am playing a 4‚Äô0 tall, homebrew species of moth (My dm and I used the stats for kobolds and added a gliding feat). She started off with a very normal life, her father was an explorer and her mother was a stay at home caretaker that had to deal with two little rambunctious kiddos, one of which being my character and the other being her younger brother.
 Now, There are a few things you need to know  about the Mothfolk- first of the canopy they live in is waaaaay high up in the sky, protected by the redwood trees and out of reach from the monsters that prowl far below on the surface. Second- moths don‚Äôt take too kindly to wild magic users. They see them as ‚Äúcursed‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe bane of all existence‚Äù, they had such a hated toward them that if they were to find out you were ‚Äútainted‚Äù with this dark art, you would be sentenced to death on the spot...and moths- are BRUTAL.
Aside from their fuzzy nature, they‚Äôre like the romans when it comes to killing those who don‚Äôt abide by the rules. And this is where our story begins.

Now, this backstory all takes place before my character was even born. My characters father was in desperate need of help, as he was backed into a corner and on deaths door before a man- that‚Äôs before a man (let‚Äôs call him the kernel) came in and leveled the thing that was about to claim his life. The moth thanked the man and said he would do anything to repay him for his kind gesture. The kernel didn‚Äôt require the man to do anything but the two did hang out for a long time, checking in on each other from time to time as the grateful mothfolk came in and of of town during his travels. But one day, As he was sitting with the Kernel, the elvish man spoke up ‚Äúold friend... I know this was long time passed, but would you mind doing a favor for me?‚Äù My characters father was eager to comply and waited patiently when the kernel said it would take a few days to get things ready, then he would tell him what needed to be done. 
Three days later, the mothfolk woke up with a searing pain in his head, shocked as he watched the color of his hands turn a blackish color as magic coursed through his veins. He tried to find the kernel... but he was long gone. Leaving the mothfolk alone to deal with the problem himself.

My characters father eventually found out the origin of the magic had to find a way of expelling the magic when he didn‚Äôt know any magic at all. Thus leading him to take frequent trips outside of the canopy to use the magic without being found out. By the time my character was conceived, the father had gotten his magic under control and was able to stay at home for longer amounts of time before going out to dispose of the magical essence that built up over time. 
My characters father was a very invested and caring parent, singing to the kids as he played his lute and having a very strong bond with my character. It was the perfect family- until he was found out...
He thought he would be able to control the power he weld without having to dispose of it, thinking he was strong enough to keep it in... strong enough to stay with his family.

But this resulted in the destruction of half of lunar canopy.... the magic releasing itself in one of the most destructive ways possible.
By literally sending a shockwave that broke banisters and supports that sent homes crashing to the ground. 
The next morning, my characters father was executed... but this was no simple execution, nonono.
 The moths would first blind the moth before ripping off the most sensitive and vital part of their body, their antennae. Next they would be tortured publicly before getting their wings ripped from their back and being shoved out of the trees, falling to their death. And if after all of that, they were still alive... well, they would be picked off by the creature‚Äôs that prowled below.

My character was traumatized. One more good thing to mention, my character was BORN with wild magic, inheriting that trait of her father and was horrified when she saw what would become of her. A year after her father‚Äôs execution, she was forced to run away after being found out and almost being murdered by her mother in the middle of the night.

To speed up the story, she fell from the trees and was forced to spend a year living in the woods, running from the monsters that lurked during the night, becoming carnivorous as she had to adapt to the harsh life she was now and eventually had to resort to cannabalism when she found an injured moth after she had been starving for days. (She was not able to rationalize the situation cause not only was she young but had gone relatively feral on this time.)
She then came across a city and was coaxed to join an underground trade. What was this trade you may ask? 
The illegal trade and selling of organs, she was in charge of dissecting the body‚Äôs and preparing the organs for market. She would occasional steal a kidney or whatever wasn‚Äôt being used as a means of food. (Don‚Äôt worry she had specific tastes so she wouldn‚Äôt eat just anything- she has standards.) aside from this job, she also worked gigs at night, singing for the townsfolk for spare change.

On one of these nights, she met someone who was a stranger to her- but oh so familiar to her family. (Wanna take a guess who?) 

Well- it was The kernel.

He took her under his wing and after finding out the shambles she lived in, took her in and some what adopted her, but this was all part of a long brewing plan- he did get sidetracked though as he did begin to get attached but remembered his mission and for reasons I do not know, stole her voice after three years and cursed her with amnesia, her only memory of him being the sound of his voice.

She went back to the underground trade before being kicked out and forced to run away from town after the burning of a mansion she may or may not have started by accident. 
So now she spends her time on the run, trying to find out where to go and trying desperately to find her voice once more.

If you thought it ended there well- to put the cherry on top of the cake, she got stuck in a barn fire after trying to make a camp fire for the night and the spell going very wrong in her favor.

A curious rouge, (one of my friends characters) finds the tiny ball of rage weeks later after tracking her down and deciding to follow her due to the endless amounts of mischief and problems that always seem to happen when she‚Äôs around. Maybe it‚Äôs bad luck? Maybe it‚Äôs just fate? But this is where the campaign starts. The two have been traveling for months and have found a way to communicate with each other, the rouge now a translator of sorts for the moth girl as they enter a tavern, unbeknownst to what may await them.",5,1585586164,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fru3ru/dnd_players_of_reddit_what_is_the_best_backstory/,DnD,1

* Rarity: Rare
* Attunement: No
* Description:

A satchel that contains a demiplane which is home to one thousand puppies and kittens which are all immortal and immune to all damage and conditions other than sleep, as well as comfortable boarding for up to ten medium humanoids, including one meal and bedding. Any humanoids that are within the satchel for more than the duration of one long rest must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be forcefully expelled from the demiplane, take 1d6 force damage, and be unable to reenter for 1d8 hours. On a successful save a creature can remain inside for the duration of a short rest before being expelled. A creature expelled in this way takes no damage. If one of the puppies or kittens within the satchel is removed begins losing its inherent magic provided by its connection to the satchel, starting over a period of 20 days, over which it loses immunity to one status condition per day in a random order. Over the next 10 days it randomly loses immunity to one damage type per day. After 30 days it begins to rapidly age to full maturity. The dog or cat retains resistance to one damage type and has a permanent +1 to all stats. You can pour out the contents of the satchel, creating rough terrain for all hostile creatures in a 30 foot radius. Each hostile creature also takes 1 piercing and 1 slashing damage per foot moved within this radius. This rough terrain lasts for 2d6 +3 minutes, at which point the puppies and kittens become tired from their play and retreat back into the satchel. It can not be used again until the next dawn.",4,1585585495,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frtw5y/satchel_of_felicanis/,DnD,1

I want there to be an experience point cost for every item.  I'm going to include a ritual so that a caster doesn't need to use their own experience, but this will require downtime from the donating player.

I figure someone has already built out these rules.  Anyone know where there's a good source for this sort of item creation?

Who would make a better social manipulator, Bard or Sorcerer? (or another class if you have a better idea).

Now, I know, bards can be more aimed towards the role play side of things. But I also look at Sorcerer‚Äôs subtle meta magic, allowing them to intertwine magic into their socializing.

frrqb7,SeraphSlaughter,Balancing a chaos magic dungeon,"I'm about to throw my players into a chaos mage controlled dungeon. I have the general outline, and am looking for tips on balancing some of my randomized ideas.  


The conceit is that the players find themselves in a casino controlled by a harlequin/jester type dragonborn mage. He speaks in limericks, loves to leave things up to chance...but always comes out on top. There are three segments: a combat focused random encounter room, a skill based platforming/magical trap room, and a final room that seems like a puzzle but is really just a way to soften up my players a bit before the 'boss' encounter with the chaos mage. That room I have down, it's just the first two and the final encounter I might need some help with. We are playing 4th edition (I know, we're switching to 5th after this + one more dungeon)  


**Combat Room**  
The way I imagine this room working is this: each player (I have 5) rolls a d20, and based on the result, out pops a monster for them to fight. Based on how high or low the roll is, you get progressively tougher/easier monsters. I don't think I need to have a separate monster for all 20 possibilites, more like nat 1 is a level 1 creature, nat 20 is something around level 16 (my players are level 13), 2-5 is a level 12 creature, 6-10 is a level 13, 10-14 is level 14, 14-19 is level 15. There will be a secondary dice roll for a party wide buff, debuff, or otherwise good/bad situation.  


  
**Skill/Platforming Room**

This one's tougher. I imagine a big chasm (lots of may players have flight/long jump abilities at this point, so it's gotta be wide as heck) the players have to get across. There will be a series of platforms, and I'm unsure if I want them randomly generated or not. For example, rolling once for how many platforms, rolling again for how large they are, and rolling a third time for average distance between them or something like that, but that seems like a lot of work mid-session, so I thought a better one would be to have a predetermined set of platforms, and the randomization comes in what kind of platform they are. For example, roll a d6 to determine if the platform has a riddle you must solve or get zapped for damage, another 1-on-1 combat encounter, a trap you must save against, etc. Some other ideas or an easy way to randomize platform placement would be helpful here.  


**Final Encounter**  
For this one, I'm imagining the chaos mage behind a magical barrier controlled by a slot machine. The barrier, at first, only comes down if you use a minor action to spin the slots and roll a nat 20 on your check (house always wins, after all). Any other number causes an effect to happen - monster spawn, a trap is placed on the map, etc. Basically reusing the hazards from the previous rooms, but in a higher pressure situation. Arcana and theivery checks as a standard action can be used to manipulate the odds on the slot machine so that the barrier comes down on other rolls besides nat 20 - I'm thinking of letting the players choose a new number on every succesful check, to give it a sort of roullette/betting theme. The mage himself is actually pretty weak, he'll just be one level 13 dude on his lonesome with not that much HP. The barrier will also reset after one round. I'll probably leave the odds as they were, so not resetting to a nat-20 only. I'm also thinking that the room will have a monster or two at the start just to prevent the players from getting lucky, rushing the slot machine and never having to face another monster aside from the mage himself.  


  
Does this sound rife with holes? It SHOULD feel chaotic, and lucky rolls should let my players get off scot free in some situations, but I don't want it to be too easy OR too difficult.",0,1585578344,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frrqb7/balancing_a_chaos_magic_dungeon/,DnD,1
frrogr,bloodphoenixxiii,Ideas on a Divination Cantrip,"So a player and I are trying to make some concepts for a campaign I'm planning to run. They want to be an aasamir Knowledge domain cleric, they mainly had grown up rough and used telling fortunes to make money until she grew up and the voices of the Angel's lead her to the temples of the knowledge god. There she studied and learned more about the world and the divine. Later the voices told her there was essentially needed to record a great historical moment and this is how she joins the campaign.

What I am curious about doing is a sort of divination cantrip. They want something that we would replace the light cantrip from her racial background. As I've pondered this I have 2 ideas and only 1 is good imo.

The first idea is essentially a sort of 8 ball cantrip. They use the cantrip and I roll a d8 with 8 generic, yet guided answers like an 8 ball. I like it, however I'm not sure that's what their looking for. I havent brought it up as I wanted multiple options but cant make idea 2 sound good.

The second idea is a super neutered version of commune. Basically as a cantrip they're can ask one question, roll either a d20 or percentile and depending on the roll they get a yes or no to their question. That still seems busted to me as they could easily just spam questions til the get the right roll.

Now obviously as I am DM I can say how many times they could try this, but I know it could be a point of irritation at the table. I want to avoid as many as possible because I have grand plans for this campaign.

So I ask you guys what sort of foretelling cantrip can you think of or would the 8 ball suffice?",13,1585578165,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frrogr/ideas_on_a_divination_cantrip/,DnD,1

Lots of discord DnD groups going on I can imagine.
We have a four person team.
One of our players is a little lack luster.  I get it that it can rotate from session to session who gets their time in the spotlight.
Hes one of our strongest tanks. With the most charisma. and knows the most about the place we are stuck in. 
We get nothing out of them.   

My team and I wanted to brainstorm before we began last session so we had a plan. We spent an hour talking to each other about different ideas we could do.  I kept trying to ping and tag our remaining member as they were online, seeing the posts, left on seen, and saying nothing.
After an hour I said I wasn't hopping into the call until ALL OF US agreed on the plan.
We got a one word answer of ""Whatever.""
It really got my mood sour. I tried to spend the rest of the session keeping the energy up. I helped my team to be inclusive. We constantly asked what our tank was doing.  I know we're all a little burnt out being stuck at home. 

This is also not the first time our teammate has done this.
He leaves mid-session. He mutes completely. He says NOTHING (even when i or my party stop to confirm they are alive or try to include them)
Doing things as a team He goes off and does things alone and says nothing. We get one word responses. So I took to ignoring him completely. 
Should this issue be addressed? If this is how he wants to play (by not playing at all) Fine but maybe this is a problem for the DM?  It makes me not want to play with him.

4. *Sagari:* A yokai spirit resembling a disfigured horse head that hangs on to trees above roads and lets out an unholy cry to any passers-by. [More info here](http://yokai.com/sagari/)
5. *Gumy≈çch≈ç:* A beautiful twin-headed bird resembling a pheasant that inhabits Nirvana. It also is said to have an extremely elegant voice. [More info here](http://yokai.com/gumyouchou/)

frqf2a,ITrashICanIKidI,Player ripped their character sheet in half.,"   So a player (A) of mine attacked another player (B). Fine by me. Player A misses first attack. Player B rebutles by casting magic missile. Player B has no spell slots left so he has to make a melee attack or use a cantrip instead. So Player B decides to punch him. Does one damage. 
   Player A then says he's gonna punch him, rolls attack and realizes he has -1 in strength. Upon realizing this Player A asks me if he could stab him instead. I allow this. The attack hits btw. Says he specifically wants to slit player B's throat. I inform him that if he wanted to call a specific attack (call shots is a older dnd mechanic I allow at my table.) he would have had to do so before rolling the attack.
    He starts bitching about how I'm not following the rules, which is true, but because of me not following the rules he is primed to stab Player B instead of punching him. Player A then proceeds to rip his character sheet in half. This same player constantly rule lawyer's me and is almost always wrong as well.

frpiuw,disgracedknight,My in-game daughter whooped my ass with a stick,"Little backstory: my character is a level 9 human fighter who used to be a soldier in his old kingdoms main military force before he deserted during a year-long war with an opposing kingdom for disobeying a direct order (which involved murdering captured civilians in a local village behind enemy lines) and was about to be executed on the spot for my insubordination until more heavily armed soldiers from the opposing kingdom swarmed into the village, many of the captured were slain during the ensuing chaos except my character, a male trapper and a female herbalist.. who would later become my characters wife and mother of their daughter.

We started a new life together in a small town at the absolute ass-end of the continent, for 8 years until wouldn't you know it, my CO during my solider days who happened to survive that skirmish located me and tried to have me assassinated, putting my family in danger once again. Which is where my characters personal quest began and where the rest of the party came in.

Anyway, my daughter for the longest time has wished to become a war domain cleric for the Dukedom up north, and has pestered me to train her personally in the art of combat ever since she was old enough to wield a weapon. Every chance I got to visit my family during downtime in the campaign or when we were passing through we would train, but despite her tenacity she had, quite frankly, not shown any promise as a warrior at all whatsoever, it also wasn't the life my character wanted for her, especially not after what he experienced all those years ago... that is, until her 17th birthday. 

As a present I bought her a wooden Bo staff to practice with, since she preferred two-handed versatile weapons anyway. So of course we had to break it in... I was not prepared for what happened next. 

She played my head like a snare drum, my wooden practice sword could not land a single hit on her (was rolling a lot of 4's and 6's for some reason) at one point she even finessed my weapon straight out of my hand. Never taking her eyes off me even for a moment but was still acutely aware of her surroundings, just like I had taught her.

I have never felt a stronger sense of both pride and shame for an imaginary child before in my life, whatever doubts I had about her choosing the path of the war cleric were elegantly thrashed out of me.",5,1585569736,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frpiuw/my_ingame_daughter_whooped_my_ass_with_a_stick/,DnD,1

I am trying to improve upon what's out there, so tell me what you dont like about your current character sheet. Do you hate how the spell slots work on it?

Even if it's just formatting or how info is presented! Post or DM me, you can even send a picture of your character sheet (please censor personal info), and that helps too, knowing the kinds of notes that people keep. 

The goal is to get an overall idea of what people like to see in a character sheet besides the regular info on there, and how to make it hands-off, easy to read, and has what you need available but packed away when it's not necessary atm.

frosyd,theoscribe,I have a theory that Radient Energy...,"...is really just hyper condensed sunlight, complete with UV rays.

Vampires are hyper susceptible to sunlight, because of the UV rays which are omitted by alternative light sources. It is known that UltraViolet rays can potentially cause skin cancers such as melanoma, and skin cancers are common compared to other forms because skin cells reproduce very frequently.

When cells reproduce frequently, [they have a higher chance of mutating during mitosis](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBiology/comments/fbrf9s/if_ageing_causes_dna_to_lose_efficiency_in_our/) as the DNA undergoes replication errors, and [radiation can damage DNA,](https://www.nature.com/articles/6601729) resulting in a higher likelihood of cancers developing. This is the reason why older people are at [higher risk of developing cancers](https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/older-adults/aging-and-cancer) than younger people- DNA degrades with time and as a result leaves the person's DNA more vulnerable to mutations.

Younger people do not have this issue because their DNA is loaded [with a protein called RecA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RecA). To put it simply, RecA is the protein which acts like temporary hit points towards DNA- it isn't needed except to extend the number of times a cell is capable of replicating itself and hopefully absorb the deterioration of DNA by factors such as ageing. I'm no true biologist but I'm fairly sure that radiation kills RecA

I have a theory that through necrotic magic or whichever other reason, vampires are less susceptible to cancers as there is an unknown rule which continually adds RecA to their mass producing cells. After all, they have a regenerative healing ability which allows them to continually replace harmed cells- they need RecA more than any of us!

However, cancer cells are a part of the body. So their immune system may not recognise that these are hostile and need to be eradicated. That, or it's more taxing for them to be combating cancer than for them to just stop producing cells to replace the ones lost from wounds. UltraViolet light fucks up their RecA so badly that it's extremely risky and extremely dangerous for them to continue healing, so it's better to not heal at all, not for a few seconds afterwards before the necrotic magic in their veins readies them for more healing. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if any of your Aasimar or Celestial Warlock OCs like to get a tan, I guess this means they're better at staying safe while doing so. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",21,1585566521,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frosyd/i_have_a_theory_that_radient_energy/,DnD,1

I feel it makes sense, saying that a Druid or Ranger could cast with intelligence, which holds the nature skill, a cleric or paladin because Religion is under it, a Sorcerer could be similar to a Wizard and actually learn their spells, Warlock (or even profane soul Blood Hunter if you allow those) could study what their patron gave them, Bards could actually have gone to college for a reason. Wizard (and Artificer, again, if allowed) would simply be locked in with Intelligence.

fro19d,KoolBoyX,Weapons feel boring to me.,"I feel like weapons are much more boring than they should be, my main thoughts are just that a majority of them don't feel rewarding, like the trident, a much less common weapon to use due to being a martial weapon, but has almost the exact same stats as a spear, I feel it should be a higher price, and deal 1d8/1d10 piercing, being versatile. My real problem though, is how simple damage types are, and that nothing allows for more uses, as if it's impossible to stab with the end of a halberd, or an insane idea to even consider slicing with a shortsword. I know, some weapons are restricted and should be, like a flail, though due to the flail being a boring weapon, I considered it being a 1d6 bludgeoning but with reach, no finesse like the whip. I noticed most finesse weapons have a minus 2 to their damage compared to weapons without it, like shortsword and longsword, dagger and spear, so on and whatnot. I feel weapons should have variants, like my flail idea. I had another idea, as the pike was generally a much longer weapon in reality, that it should be different. A pike should attack with disadvantage at close range, like a lance, but be able to reach further. Thus, you could attack up to 15 feet away from you, but deal 1d8 or 1d6 instead, either way, the weapons make me feel like the Fighters are less appealing, despite my loving making them to death. That's my rant, and yes, I very much excluded magic weapons, our DM doesn't give us many of those is my reason for excluding them.",19,1585562669,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fro19d/weapons_feel_boring_to_me/,DnD,1

He can feel the perfect storm coming, man, and like... when he sees that wave he just gets stoked, man, cause he feel it, man. Hermits also get proficiency with Herbalism, and you can imagine what herb Bodhi thinks is most killer: ""oregano, brah.""

Outside of combat, Bodhi is most useful for handing out goodberries and some relaxing ""oregano."" Hes always going on about how you need to ""like, ride the waves of life, brah"" (as per the leadership feat). Despite his chill demeanor, however, he has one major problem:

When he is stressed he turns into a deranged giant octopus. A deranged giant octopus that's is, to everyone's chagrin, both a monk and a tavern brawler.

I will be the first to admit, I was unaware how fun it would be to be a giant octopus monk with tavern brawler. The first time we got into combat, I started off by wrapping my poor victim up, dropping a flurry of blows, and then promptly throwing him at his nearest friend. I tore through that battlefield at breakneck speeds, leaving behind a train of slime covered bodies. When the dust settled, and Bodhi -in tattered clothes- returned to his senses at last, the party never again trusted his kindly ""facade.""",0,1585556818,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frmziv/introducing_bodhi/,DnD,1
frmyyl,MrMcMuffin26,The Party vs Jazz,"So I have been running my first campaign for a couple weeks now and was trying to think of an encounter for this weeks session. The party was heading to a music venue in the city to meet someone for information and I thought it would be fun to have a saxophone playing jazz halfling on stage with animated instruments. It was at this moment I realised there are stats for animated objects already made and decided to make the party fight the band. 

There is something about rolling to hit your Barbarian with a piano while a halfling is aggressively playing a saxophone that makes me so happy to be a DM",2,1585556731,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frmyyl/the_party_vs_jazz/,DnD,1
frmx7t,joc95,don't be afraid to improve away from the quest books and create your own world building,"I've been DM'ing for the first time over the space of a 2 months now playing the Lost Mines of Phandelver. my friend DM'ed 1/4 of the campagin last year until we shelved the game due to college/work reasons.

Then eventually i decided I'll DM the rest of the game. my friend loves to improvise characters. for example, Toblin Stonehill is now a 70 year old man called Mick with a strong Rural Irish/Limerick accent, and he wears a yellow towel on his head. and the TownMaster has been the most hilarious character he's invented. IRL, my friend was stretching his back and legs while roleplaying him and we all laughed thinking that was the character, but he said he was just feeling stiff from sitting and he kicked some empty beer cans too. now every time we see the townmaster, I have to stretch and kick as many cans as possible.

Many of the players said he is so incompetent due to being more interested in stretching and not listening to players. the players then asked whens the next Election for town master, i said it would be a Tenday, and the town master panicked saying he forgot to make election posters. The players encouraged Mick(Toblin) to be the new town master and go in the election race.

Then after capturing Glass Staff, the players demanded a Public Hanging. he was sent to Never Winter to be put on trial and then escorted back to be hanged. the players were so enthusiastic to here this I just had to make it where leftover Redbrand and Orcs had to gate crash.... but my players were smart and instantly decided to all wake up an hour before the hanging and stake out. They kept their weapons and spells ready to strike if the Evil Mage tried to escape. A crowd gathered around including other NPCs the players have met like sister Garelle, Mick, Gungren, Sildar and Darren. I made it where a Redbrand was using stealth and pick-pocked our wizard to take the magical glassstaff of protection. 

When the town master pulled the lever to hang the mage, we noticed he seemed to be floating.......a red brand was hiding under the gallow and holding up his body. The Redbrands Last Stand! the players instantly shot the evil mage who managed to struggle out of his noose and he was killed in 2 rounds. I decided the best course of action for the town master was to hide under the gallows in a fetal position.

our players fished him out, and then told all the public that this man is not fit have a second term and everyone should vote for Mick. the town chanted his name and we ended the session. I cant wait for the local election and to see what else my players will think of next. It was the most fun session we all had because My players outsmarted me, but they still didn't exactly know what they were going to expect from me.

TL;DR I created an extra quest relating to the lost mines because the players were so enthusiastic to have more content, and we love to just RP the NPCs in our own way",0,1585556466,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frmx7t/dont_be_afraid_to_improve_away_from_the_quest/,DnD,1
frmtyb,TheTiefTheif,Is this idea Stupid?,"So im starting a new campaign soon and my player characters (pc's) dont know each other.

the way im going to introduce them is by the tavern trope but im changing it up a bit

""while your traveling on the road to greenest (im starting HotDQ) you see some clouds rolling across the sky begin to darken. as the sun starts its decent a roar of thunder fills your ears"" ""you know shelter must be sought out but you are far from any civilization. as you walk up a hill you see a small building with smoke coming out of the chimney"" ""the clouds are almost directly overhead and it starts to rain""

the Place has a sign outside saying Mash Tavern open always. and another on the door states no fighting unless in the pit. 

anyway the Mash Tavern is a random bar filled with all kinds of bad guys. goblins orcs kobalds gladiators specters and bandits. as well as a succubus working as a prostitute for peoples souls in the corner. they dont become hostile but there is a fighting pit in the basement that any dissagreements can be settled. 

I want the players to meet up and maybe fight the crocodile currently in the pit here while the storm goes over. then they can proceed to greenest to officially start the module. 

I have a goliath barbarian a dragonborn bard a halfing ranger and an elven rouge

Wanting some ideas on other cool badguys i can put here or just general takes on this idea

I have found myself as DM to our amateur group and I want to make the campaign time sensitive. (Our group has the tendency to move slowly, so I want to break the habit with repercussions). The campaign is a train heist. In the beginning, our group finds themselves in the middle of a desert discouraged about the lost rewards of our previous campaign.

The question: is there some sort of charm or spell that induces a loss of time like in Homer‚Äôs Odyssey? The idea is that if the group decides to explore they will lose a week, but since the train has a schedule it balances out in time, but annoys the quest giver. Please help.

frmhke,RadionRed,Limited Magic Immunity,"My DM put us in combat last session against creatures with Limited Magic Immunity and also hinted that he is planning on throwing more of them at us. I have no problem with this except that I think he's ruling it wrong (which I could live with since he's the DM) and inconsistently (which is what really bugs me).

Limited Magic Immunity states:

&gt;The Rakshasa can't be affected or detected by spells of 6th level or lower unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

When we Webbed the ground around them, he said they walked through it completely unaffected because it was a spell of 6th level or lower. But when my character used Green Flame Blade, he said it worked just fine since it was cast on my sword and not on them, so there was an intermediary object.

I asked him why casting the web on the ground wouldn't work, since by the same logic I'm casting web on the ground not on them, which should be an intermediary object. He said because the webs were conjured by magic, that they weren't there before and are thus magic which the Rakshasas can ignore. Apparently GFB just buffs my sword and since the sword was there before, it's fine? Except the magical flames are... magical and from a cantrip which is a level 0 spell. Like I said, his ruling is inconsistent as far as I can tell or at least his logic is.

By his ruling, a conjured creature shouldn't do anything since they didn't exist before. Creation to create a 2 ton boulder over the Rakshasa's head would do nothing since it didn't exist before. The Rakshasa would completely ignore Mage Armor since it's magic and act as if my AC didn't have it on. Illusions would be totally ignored if cast as 6th or lower spells. Magic weapon should work since it's buffing my weapon, but Spiritual Weapon would not since it's a magically conjured weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

According to [Jeremy Crawford](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2018/08/04/rakshasa-can-pass-through-wall-of-stone-it-is-immune-of-a-fire-elemental-conjured-by-a-5th-level-conjure-elemental/):

&gt;Because of the Limited Magic Immunity trait, a Rakshasa could stroll through the wall created by the wall of stone spell, but not if the wall becomes permanent and nonmagical (aka undispellable). A Rakshasa's Limited Magic Immunity offers no protection against a summoned creature. The creature's presence is a spell effect. The creature itself is not a spell effect.

Wizards' [Sage Advice Compendium](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SA-Compendium.pdf) says:

&gt;The effects of an instantaneous spell are brought into being by magic, but the effects aren‚Äôt sustained by magic (see PH, 203). The magic flares for a split second and then vanishes. 

The PHB, 203 says:

&gt;Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.

I don't know how to concisely rule that things do or don't work. GFB targets the Rakshasa and is a harmful, offensive, cantrip: thus it's easy to rule that it doesn't work (which my DM disagrees with as stated above). So I could say spells that target the Rakshasa, but then we get Fireball and that targets a point and not necessarily the Rakshasa and I would also say that they're immune to low level Fireballs because it just makes sense. Can't say instantaneous spell since Moonbeam is concentration and they'd ignore a low level Moonbeam because that makes sense. 

However, web should work as all three of the above quotes agree that once conjured, there is no magic to be immune to. Conjured creatures work by the same logic: their existence is a spell effect but the creature itself is not. However, a Rakshasa should be able to walk right through a Wall of Force or Wall of Stone since they're concentration spells and are being maintained by magic, but once that Wall of Stone is permanent, the Rakshasa treats it as a normal piece of rock. An illusion should work since it's not directly affecting them so there's nothing to be immune to, it's just light and sound messing with their senses. Fog spell or Darkness or Silence should also work as that affects the environment and not them so there is nothing to be immune to.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to build a version of Kilgrave, the Marvel villain and Jessica Jones' nemesis. For those unfamiliar, in the comic books (and show) he has telepathic powers, able to compel actions just by telling someone to do it.

The campaign is level 5 characters (and no level up).

So I want to have a dialogue about my limited experience so far with Adjusted XP in a campaign I'm running right now.  


**Context**:  
D&amp;D 5e  
5 players  
Hex crawl - Tomb of Annihilation Module  
DM (me) has only been Mastering for 2 years, still learning  


So I stumbled on a [resource](https://dhmstark.co.uk/rpgs/encounter-calculator-5th/) for calculating total monster XPs and difficulty for my party.  
Throughout our campaign so far, it would seem that I've been rewarding them the divvied up Adjusted XP, not the base monster XP, having interpreted Adjusted as ""Well there are more monsters and more risk, so better reward! That's only fair.""  


I haven't really made huge changes to how my mobs and such interact with the group (damage, health, abilities etc), they're doing really well, and their XP is right where it needs to be for this section of the campaign.  


Generally my question is:

* Yes, I understand AXP is for gauging encounter difficult ""only""
* Yes, I understand the original rules seem to incentivize Divide &amp; Conquer tactics
* *Yes*, I also understand that as the DM I can just make executive calls...
* No, don't want ""Well Pg. 82 says....... So. /end transmission/""

However... How have I been giving double XP from levels 1-5, and it *still* feels like they're right where they need to be, if not slightly behind still...?  
Does this only work at lower levels and creates overpowered characters at later levels...?

frl29e,helpimfatandstupid,Throwing your friends into a no win situation.,"So, started a new campaign with the bois last Friday. First encounter was with three ghouls with 63 health each, this is their first fight so they are all level 1 still; the ghouls are level 3 so kinda tough but doable. After the first ghoul goes down then I spring it on them. Level 8 foulspawn out of nowhere with 22 ac, they cant even touch it without rolling a nat 20. 

So my bois start going down, elf druid goes down first and she is not happy about it. She wouldn't acknowledge anything else that happened the rest of the encounter. Next is the minotaur warden, who is much more realistic about the whole thing. Hes making save throws while the deva goes down. She shrugs it off though and just waits for it all to end. Last is the living rock who also just kind goes with it.

So now they are all down, before they can die though some NPCs show up and one- two kill the foulspawn and save them. Druid is happy again, everyone is still alive, and they got enough xp to level them on the spot and a pouch of gold that refills three times in total for their troubles.

Tl;Dr: ruin your friendships by throwing them into no win situations and save the friendships by rewarding them handsomely.",10,1585546529,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frl29e/throwing_your_friends_into_a_no_win_situation/,DnD,1

**Gambler‚Äôs Dagger** *(very rare dagger)*

The first time you attack with the dagger on each of your turns, you can choose a number from 1 to 4. The dagger gains a bonus to attack and damage equal to that number. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.

If you roll below the dagger‚Äôs current bonus on the weapon damage die, then you take force damage equal to the dagger‚Äôs current bonus. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means.

On a critical hit you take the damage for each of the weapon‚Äôs damage dice that rolls below the dagger‚Äôs current bonus. For each additional weapon damage die that doesn‚Äôt, increase the attack‚Äôs damage by the dagger‚Äôs current bonus.",7,1585540507,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frjs10/gamblers_dagger_homebrew/,DnD,1

Wondering if D&amp;D ever had or does have spin off games where story exists? In D&amp;D, only combat matters. The rules are solely designed for combat. Even the skills are, too, with very little thought put into the social rolls included in it. Those are just a means to eventually hit someone with a stick. Don't get me wrong, I like hitting monsters with sticks too, but when the entire system is solely about hitting things with sticks it gets boring. I want something that's still D&amp;D lore and race related, but with a ruleset that's story focused?

frjir8,IAmTaka_VG,"Need help with a player, level 5 ranger, able to make possibly 4 sharp shot attacks?","Hey guys,

Having a blast DMing this game however I just need a rules clarification on my Revised Ranger 5e player.

Here are some stats

- Level 5 Human (He took the feat variant)
- 5e Revised Ranger
- He has ""fighting style"" archery
- He has the Hunter Conclave perk so he has Horde Breaker and can attack twice
- He has the feat Sharpshooter (level 4)
- He took the human variant feat Crossbow Expert
- He has Natural Explorer from revised which gives him this perk (On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attackrolls against creatures that have not yet acted.)


So my question is this. At level 5 rangers get an extra attack so he has two attacks. He also can use ""Crossbow Expert"" to add a third attack using his bonus action. He also has the feat Horde Breaker which if there are two enemies within 5 feet, he can do a FOURTH attack.

To top it off with his ""Sharpshooter"" feat that he took, he takes just a -5 to attack penalty to be able to add +10 damage possibly to all 4 attacks? I'm just making sure that's correct here as I have this ranger from 60-100 feet away doing significantly more damage than even my wizard players.

Can anyone confirm this is all correct using 5e revised ranger?

frjelu,Entel7,Funniest quotes from the table?,"""Can I attune to my pet orc?""

---

I gave my player a portable hole, but ""locked it"" for the moment. I decided it would just be a sort of bag-of-holding-esque fabric that he could fold up and put in his pocket for now. 

He experimented, and noticed that if he threw a rock into the hole, it came out at the same speed. Then, he gently placed a rock in, folded up the portable hole, shook it like crazy, and opened it back up. *fwoosh* A rock shot out.

Intrigued, he folded it up and said nothing. I, the DM, was surprised he didn't want to do anything further. Whatever.

Sessions later, during an encounter with orcs, one particularly hard to kill orc remained. The player moved his mini 25ft so he was behind the orc, and silently gestured taking the portable hole from his breast pocket, unfurling it, and capturing the orc inside. Shocked, I went ahead and rolled a Dex save for the orc, thinking maybe he could dodge out of the way... and rolled a natural 1.

""Okay, you capture the orc. He's now locked in your portable hole.""

Silently, the player clasps his hands together and shakes them violently. 

""You intuit the orc is now likely travelling very fast inside the portable hole.""

The player: ""...alright guys."" *puts portable hole away in breast pocket* ""...let's take a long rest.""

""DM, can I attune to my pet orc?""

Me: ""...no.""

Player: ""Oh. Alright."" 

He opens the portable hole, arms outstretched far so he wouldn't get hit by:

The orc: "".....aaaaaaAAAAAAHHHHHHH"" *splat*

fripeh,OhGeeOleGreg,Struggling with Balanced Encounters,"To preface this I'm dming for a party of 7 characters: A dwarf Arcane Archer, an aasimar celestial warlock, a yuan-ti berzerker barbarian, a ratman artillerist, a loxodon beastmaster ranger, and a gnome and a wood elf assassin all lvl 3 (just leveled to 4).

So in our last session my party had two encounters with various gnolls. The first encounter was pretty challenging, they went up against 5 Gnolls and 2 hyenas, and the party all got pretty hurt and I made them use up most of their healing spells. I felt confident in them getting to the next encounter with a Gnoll Fang of Yeenoghu, 4 gnolls, and 2 hyenas. 

However, much to my dismay, they ended up completely demolishing my ""mini boss encounter"" much easier than they did the previous one. They managed to do 38 damage between the artillerist and Celestial warlock to the Gnoll Yeenoghu in one round, and I didn't manage to hit any of the players due to some really shitty dice rolls.

Needless to say, I felt very disappointed with the fight and was wondering how I can workshop it in the future. I had to give the party a surprise round since they managed to ambush the camp the gnolls were in with successful stealth checks and again my dice rolls was so bad for perception.

The next encounter I have planned is for them to fight some hell hounds, imps, and eventually an Incubus. Are there any ways I can possibly make the mini boss encounter more challenging. Dice rolls aside, I want my players to sweat.

I recently started a campaign as a trickery domain cleric, first thing I'd like to ask is, do the spells that you cast with invoke duplicity cast as a bonus action, or an action. I'd also like to know what kind of plays you guys run with the trickery domain. Does the Duplicate get its own turns for casting as it doesnt say anything about the kind of casting/the way it casts, it just says you can cast spells through it. I'd assume I would have to use an action to cast through it and a bonus action for spells like healing words. But I always assumed it had its own turn for casting. Any help on the domain and the ways you use it are welcomed with alot of gratitude.

There was a battle ax, so I called dibs! I was planning on giving someone else the mace, or just hold on to it till I could sell it.

frhi7d,ArnaktFen,Is combat SUPPOSED to be the easiest thing to DM?,"I DMed for my first time yesterday, and I discovered something interesting: I was far less stressed working with over twenty combatants (I threw thirteen bandits, a boar, a necromancer, and two of the necromancer's zombies at my five PCs) than I was working with just the PCs and three NPCs in a tavern. It was so much easier for me to process battle tactics and enemy psychology than it was to deal with three guys who had voices, and I didn't even have to deal with opposite-gender voices.

Heck, my players literally jumped out a window during combat into a wilderness that I hadn't prepared at all, and dealing with that was *still* easier than the tavern.

frhc1z,Luke_EXE123,My experience with Dungeon of the Mad Mage (spoilers),"This is a D&amp;D story for the Dungeon of the Mad Mage. My group of five players and I took on the challenge at the Yawning Portal for my friend to try out DMing, so we were treating it as a oneshot. The party consists of a human fighter, a dwarf barbarian, a goliath paladin, a half-elf wizard, and me, the dragonborn cleric. This is the story of the rise and fall of a curious party in hopes to settle a woman's longing and fill an old woman's obsession for ancient artifacts. Since I played as Frugus the Dragonborn, I figured I should tell the story through his eyes. This is how it goes‚Ä¶

I find myself in a tavern enjoying just another drink. When from within the well in the middle of the tavern, adventurers rise out of the well and everybody in the tavern stands up and cheers for them. Everyone is praising them and the whole place is going crazy. To me this looks like a gig that I would want to partake in. I've had very little adventures in my time; however, I want to go and explore the world and battle enemies along the way. I was a soldier from my hometown, but unfortunately I was only in one measly fight in which I lost. From that loss, I now have a permanent scar going down my face. 

As my eyes dart around the room trying to figure out what's happening here, I notice other adventurers standing up looking just as anxious as me to get into the yawning portal. I, bursting with excitement, run to the well to jump inside. I'm quickly stopped by the humble beernut, the half-elf wizard. He looks at me and screams, ‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? That will be a 300 ft fall, you die in an instant if you jump down there!‚Äù The bartender screams out, ‚ÄúEven if you were going to jump down there, I won't let you without any missions or a party. Look around the tavern and find some, then our humble goliath will let you down into the yawning portal.‚Äù 

I start looking around for people to join the party to go fight the quests the people will give to us so that I don't die alone in the well. I find a human, a goliath (not the pulley goliath), and Bearnut the half-elf to bring along on this journey with me; they all seem very eager as well. All we have to do next is find some quests!

We start looking around for a quest, the first person we stumble upon as an old woman. She asks us if we'd be willing to go down the yawning portal and retrieve artifacts for her. The party all at once shouts out, ‚ÄúOf course we'll do that for you along the way, and we will give any artifacts to you for some gold.‚Äù She seems very excited about this and leaves the tavern. 

We continue to look around for more quests so that when we return we can get more gold. The next person we find is a crying woman in the corner of the tavern. We ask her if there's anything that we can do for her to ease her sadness. She says that her brother went down to the well and hasn't returned for two weeks. She's fairly certain that he's dead at this point; however, any hope that she has leads her to follow us.

I step out in front of the group, ‚ÄúWe will gladly help you find your brother. What does he look like and what is your family crest?‚Äù She then proceeded to show us a picture of both - her brother and the family crest. The half-elf stands up, ‚ÄúIt must be hard losing family, but we can help you out.‚Äù 

The whole party starts walking towards the well and the pulley goliath. This goliath operates an elevator to go down to the bottom of the well. We pay him the respected amounts, and as I get on the elevator, he looks at us and says, ‚ÄúAre you ready to go? Hop on!‚Äù And before we could even say anything, the goliath lets go of the rope sending us into a free fall roughly 300 feet down. Apparently this goliath wasn't very smart. Quickly the wizard casts a *feather falling* spell so that our legs did not shatter into a million pieces when we hit the ground. We all landed safely. 

Stepping forward, the human booms, ‚ÄúAll right, which way you want to go left or ri‚Ä¶‚Äù He was quickly interrupted by a chicken that appeared right in front of him.

The goliath in our group was surviving on one brain cell and quickly ran after the chicken, following it down the right path. The party followed. We turned the corner and saw our goliath staring straight up into the ceiling with a feather stuck into it. I start flipping out. I believe there's some form of trap or enemy nearby. I cast *detect magic* and *detect traps*, yet there is nothing there. The half-elf suddenly jumps on the goliath‚Äôs shoulders to reach the chicken's feather. When he touches it, the chicken falls from the ceiling knocking the half-elf off of the goliath‚Äôs shoulders to be caught by the human. However, the chicken quickly disappears. 

The half-elf mischievously turned over to me and said, ‚ÄúThat was a pretty good joke, right? Casting a *minor illusion* on our goliath really was something funny.‚Äù 

Both of us laughed and the goliath knew no better; however, I was left on edge. We continue to walk down the hallway. I was leading the way with my ability to cast *light.* To our right, two of the party members notice that there is a door that wasn't there before. We quickly investigate the room. Slowly entering the room, we are stunned to find three large sculptures and a corpse of a hobgoblin that has obviously been there for a long time. I cast *animate dead* on the body bringing him partially to life. We quickly grow a connection with the hobgoblin. He becomes our friend, and even though he's a zombie, we named him Skittles. Skittles has a staff for us that I can repair with *mending*, so I do. I grasp the staff that Skittles was holding and when I cast *mending*, the old, rickety wooden staff turns into a beautifully-crafted purple staff with a glistening diamond gem on the end. However, when I repair the staff, it lets out a horrible screech and alerts all nearby enemies of our location.

From down the dark hallway we hear screaming and shouting from a few men. The men clamor, ‚ÄúI think I heard a noise down there; let's go this way!‚Äù

Quickly thinking off the top of my head, I conjure up *create water* in the hallway they were running down. A torrent of water fills the hallway pushing them back into the spears they were wielding, killing all of them immediately. We're safe, for now. We loot them and then continue to walk down the hallway. 

We approach a room filled with four more dudes - one of which was a dark elf standing by the door to look out. We quickly kill off the look-out using a single blow from a javelin. There are still three more guys sleeping on the ground though. We try to knock two of them unconscious; however, one of them we beat to a pulp before finally knocking him unconscious. No matter how many times we tried, the party struggled to roll a high enough strength check to knock him out. In a last great attempt, we nail him knocking him unconscious. I take the rope I have in my pouch, and I tie up the last person with a nat 20. He‚Äôs wrapped so well that I unwittingly tie him to the floorboard underneath him through the holes in the floorboard. We interrogate the man and he tells us that there is something much worse than themselves on the floor. He warns that we are in danger and we should watch our backs. Despite his ardent warnings and since we are a group on a mission, we continue on.

After walking down a couple of hallways with very little interaction with NPCs or enemies, we come across a large throne room. On the far side of the room, there is a large throne made out of bones. In the middle of the room, there is a dead dragon surrounded by broken cage parts and shattered crystals strewn all over. The goliath clunks past the mess and sits down on the throne. Snakes jump up from underneath the throne and ferociously attack him, starting an encounter. 

I, however, have no interest in this. Gripped with curiosity, my eyes dart around the room at the dragon and the crystals. I pick up one of the crystals and replace it with the staff crystal diamond that Skittles gave me. The new gem doesn't really change much other than when I cast spells. The staff now fires in a single beam. To the right, there is a large barricaded door. We easily break through to get to the other room. 

We open the large door forcefully and we're met by three manticores. At first sight of them, the goliath steps up, dealing tons of damage to the first manticore. I swiftly run up afterwards and pry a manticore‚Äôs mouth open with my bare hands. As a copper Dragonborn, I use my breath weapon straight down the manticores throat into his innards, killing him from the inside out. The fight continues. The wizard and I choose to stay behind, not doing very much other than giving support and health to our allies, while the other two members kill the last two manticores using all their might. When the fight is over, we discover our last party member.

From within the manticores‚Äô nest, a dwarf pops holding a large white bag. Multiple times, we ask, ‚ÄúWhat is in the bag?‚Äù He refuses to tell us. 

We instruct Skittles to go over to the bag and take out what‚Äôs inside. Nat 20. Inside the bag, the dwarf is holding the Deck of Many Things. I immediately draw two cards. My first card allows me to forget something in my past as if it never happened because it never will have happened. I immediately think back on my past and wish that the encounter I had with the goblin so many years ago never happened so that my face would return to normal. No sooner do I think it does my wish come true, and the scar disappears from my face. My next card gives me proficiency and multiple stats. 

The human is also excited that we have the Deck of Many Things. He runs over, pushing me out of the way to draw a card. He draws a card that holds the image of a gold key in the flames, and in his hands, a beautifully-crafted blade falls into his clutches. Astonished, the human looks closely. It is The Nine Lives Stealer - a sword whose story has been told through myths and legends. All of us with our new gear continue through the dungeon. 

The next room is large and leads to two hallways that both go to the same room where we continue on. What we can make out from the dark figure is a large ballisk preoccupied with something else on the other side of the room. I charge in for the first blow. Immediately, I realize that was a mistake. I look the ballisk straight into his eyes and my hands start to turn to stone. Quaking in my boots, I am afraid that this is going to be the end of me. I don't remember what happened next; however, I survive long enough to break free from the ballisk‚Äôs curse. I awake just in time to throw my javelin that I had found on my adventures. It is a special javelin. I clutch it in my fists and launch it, and it changes into a lightning bolt and flares through the sky like Zeus‚Äô. 

I successfully take down the ballisk. Elated, I take a deep breath. My reprieve from worry turns suddenly to desperation. Panic sets in. With my chest pounding, I leap forward, and running with all I have within me, I head to where the lightning struck. My head spins with fear. ‚ÄúNoooo!‚Äù I scream. I scramble. I feel confusion and dismay. What have I done? How irresponsible to use the Javelin without knowing how it worked! I stare at the damage. I drop to my knees in shame. My friends have been hit in the crossfire (the whole party). I was unaware how this Javelin of lightning worked. 

Injured and stunned, the party survived the fight and goes to examine the corpse of the ballisk. In the clutches of the ballisk‚Äôs hands, we find what remains of the woman's brother - a mere hand with the family's crest on a ring on one of the fingers. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do about the woman's brother, but at least we are still going to get paid. We move on. However we will not be moving on much past this point‚Ä¶

We enter, four statues clearly made out of marble with the fifth being a deep black, almost as black as the endless abyss that is space. When I observe it, I notice that it has a liquid texture to it. My impulsivity leads me to smash the statue with my mace. As I hit the statue, it catches me. I can't move; it's taking in my mace. little did I know, as well as it took me way too long to realize, this was no statue, but rather an ooze monster. The ooze starts to crawl up my arms all the way to my shoulders. My new human friend runs over to me and grabs me to try to pull me out. He does, but it is the most painful thing that I have experienced in my life. The ooze flows off of the statue onto the floor, ready to strike. We all take turns throwing blows at it, but nothing is working. With every blow, the ooze splits into two copies of itself making itself even more deadly than the last time we had struck. My next move will not only end my own life but my entire party's lives. For some reason, I have the great idea that if we drown it in water, the ooze will dissipate into the water and all will be fine. I was right about the ooze dissipating in the water, however I was not right about the outcome of my actions. I use *create water* in the room that we are in, filling it to the max. The ooze floats to the top of the water. Unbeknownst to my expectations, it sinks into the water. With its acidic qualities, it turns the entire pool of water into a deadly pool of acid. This pool of acid will end the story of this group of adventurers, boiling us all alive, melting the flesh off our bones.

A big thank you to everybody that read this. I hope you enjoyed it! I just wanted to tell the story of this ‚Äúone shot‚Äù that I played with my friends that I really enjoyed. We plan on playing soon, and hopefully, if it's exciting enough, I can tell you guys the story of our next campaign. Overall, I was a little upset that in the end we all died to my own stupidity. This is my first time writing something like this, so hopefully by next time, I will learn more about how to write these types of stories and bring you more tales of my friends and I going on great adventures!",0,1585530469,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frhc1z/my_experience_with_dungeon_of_the_mad_mage/,DnD,1

frh4fh,Brexinga,Genuinely Curious.,"Hey everyone!

I'll start up by being honest. I have never played DnD, have never met or known someone who ever told me that he played DnD nor do I know anything about it other than it's roleplaying and uses Dice to decide stuff.

That being said, I have always loved everything about Fantasy and have been, in my teenager years on some online ""RPG Make Your Story"" forum. Forum where you write a dynamic story with someone else. 

I've always been curious about the game and I've always had question, and decided that today was as good as any day to ask them. So let's go. P.S 

1. If not through internet, how did some of y'all found each other? 90's kid?
2. How many people does it usually take to have a fun game? You can play Risk with 2 players, but it ain't the same thing.
3. How long does a game usually last and is the ""Master of the game"" always that, or do you switch every now often so that everyone levels up together and just finds excuses for the absence?
4. For how long have you been wth your party?
5. Why DnD and not everyother MMORP option out there on consoles and computer?
6. Partner in life participating or understands. If he/she understand, did he/she ever tried a game, or do they understand that it's your safe haven.
7. If you want to say anything else. Go for it. As I said, Never played, one of the thing I wished I could have tried younger, but never found anyone playing it. I'm genuinely Curious.",7,1585529647,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frh4fh/genuinely_curious/,DnD,2

frgxys,Redreversecard,We Finally Completed Tomb of Annihilation,"So, my group just finished our first major, long-running campaign and I just want to rant a little bit.

At the beginning, we declared that we wanted a difficult campaign, coming fresh off the heels of an easy, boring, slog-fest. We asked the DM to not pull any punches, and to run the game on a very hard difficulty. My character was a fighter, with high dexterity and proficiency in acrobatics, which our DM allowed us to use for grappling, which he made an attack action. So, every single time we'd fight a major enemy, I'd grapple, then suplex them.

I suplexed Acererak at the end. We ended up defeating him. Our DM had set his hit points to absolute maximum and we STILL won. It was great.",2,1585528951,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frgxys/we_finally_completed_tomb_of_annihilation/,DnD,1

frgub2,Eternal_Destiny,"[Story] The 3 Steves, a zombie rat, and a broken DM...","My family and I started a new campaign. I play with my two sisters, and my dad DMs. Our characters and the campaign plot all reside in a morally grey area. 

One sister decides to play a monk somewhat modeled after Doctor Strange, so she took the Way of a The Four Elementals and called him ‚ÄúSteve B. Wyrd‚Äù, effectively creating a pun and an homage to her inspiration. 

My other sister is playing a psychotic, druggy, beast master ranger who will (eventually) be able control a swarm of rats. He goes by Ratman, of course. His actual name is unknown, but people started referring to him as ‚ÄúWeird Steve‚Äù. 

Obviously having 2 Steves that are also Weird make things hilariously and unnecessarily complicated. But that‚Äôs not all. 

I‚Äôm stuck playing a much needed cleric, but I decided make it fun with a tiefling trickery domain cleric (for anyone wondering, yes, modeled after Jester Lavorre from CR). She‚Äôs got a fun, deep, backstory I‚Äôm pretty pleased with, but for the sake of brevity, all you have to know is that she doesn‚Äôt technically have a name- she was never given one. 

But anyways, when she struggles to introduce herself to an NPC, Steve B. Wyrd thinks it‚Äôs ridiculous she doesn‚Äôt have a name and (half-jokingly) names her... 

Be Steve Weird. (Bee for short)

My character is a bit salty, sassy, and generally doesn‚Äôt care, so she accepts the name. Combat later ensures against some monsters. My poor dad tries to refer to Steve, only to be met with a chorus of ‚Äúwhich one?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe weird one!‚Äù 

‚Äú... which one?‚Äù

Cue my dad putting his head on the table and laughing very hard. We broke him ;)

Now, the zombie rat incident occurred when we had some interparty conflict. Weird Steve threw one of his pet rats (whose name is Doris) at Bee Steve Weird, and she warned him that that was a dumb idea on his part, and upon the rat biting her, which took half of her health (yay level 1!) she cast her last available spell as ‚ÄúInflict Wounds‚Äù and completely decimated Doris. She was left in shreds on the floor and Ratman was hysterical. 

Our poor DM is watching this all go down, and since our shaky alliance was the foundation for this adventure, and Ratman (backed up by Steve B. Wyrd) wanted to leave Bee behind, he had to come up with a solution. 

And what do you know! Miraculously, the forgotten realm deity of necromancy, who Doris the rat worshipped (yes, you heard that right) decided to take pity on this poor creature and bring her back to life. 

Unfortunately Doris, being shredded, didn‚Äôt return to her original shape and instead resembles more of a breathing, moaning, ‚Äúground beef‚Äù ball than a rat. But Ratman will happily keep her!


TL;DR: Much to the DM‚Äôs dismay we all named our character some combination of ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeird‚Äù, and then after some interparty conflict a party member‚Äôs pet rat was annihilated, and brought back to life as a shapeless blob of rat.",3,1585528594,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frgub2/story_the_3_steves_a_zombie_rat_and_a_broken_dm/,DnD,3

frgp5p,Hail_Papyrus,Making a Cursed Zombie Cow Monster,"I'm in the process of making a homebrew campaign for my second attempt at DMing (possibly ambitious, I know), and looking for some advice. The knowledgeable people I'd usually turn to are going to be players, so I turn to you lovely people of Reddit.

This particular set piece is LOOSELY based on the story of Jack and the Beanstalk, in that there's a cow that needs to be dealt with, and maybe some magic beans as a reward. The farmer lady who owns the cow is convinced it's evil and cursed and she needs to get rid of it, which is where the party come in. They need to remove this creature from the farm, and take it away to be either uncursed (there's probably a word for that but I'm tired) or kill it but away from the farm. They'll be strongly encouraged to uncurse the cow and bring it back, but I'm not relying on them following through with that.

I'm looking for creative, interesting ways to make this not a normal cow, which aren't particularly dangerous but very clearly odd. I'm thinking it spontaneously burps fire every 10 minutes, or projectile attacks mysteriously shatter on impact without doing damage. I don't want it to be super super easy to kill, hence the suggested zombie part, but also not impossible for a very very low level party (like 4 players at level 1 or 2) to handle. As it currently stands, it's not aggressive, but will try to defend itself if attacked of course.

My current build is below, I'd appreciate any thoughts, suggestions or constructive criticism :)



Cursed Cow
HP 25
AC 10

Gore.¬†Melee Weapon Attack:¬†+6 to¬†hit,¬†reach 5¬†ft.,¬†one target.¬†Hit:¬†7 (1d6¬†+¬†4)¬†piercing damage

Charge.¬†If the cow moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

Innate Spellcasting. It can innately cast¬†dancing lights¬†at will, requiring no components. It does so when feeling any particularly strong emotion. Soft pink means it is amused, deep blue is sadness, green expresses curiosity, and crimson is anger.

Projectile Immunity. Any projectile aimed at the cow will either bounce off harmlessly or shatter on impact (at the DMs discretion). Typically, improvised or weak weapons such as twigs or stones would shatter, whereas more durable weapons such as arrows or javelins would just bounce off. In either case, the cow feels nothing and appears oblivious to anything having occured.

Every 10 minutes (in game) outside of combat, the DM rolls a d6. If the result is odd, roll again on the table below. If it is even, nothing happens. If the cow is attacked or attacks, the effect ends.

D8 Random Effect Table

1 - the cow is completely invisible for one minute

2 - any buckles or ropes restricting the cow spontaneously unbuckle or untie and drop to the floor

3 - the cow sneezes fire, enough to startle but not light anything on fire unless it is immediately close to the cows snout (do cows have snouts or noses?)

4 - all the black splotches on the cow turn white, and all the white turns black. Permanently, unless this effect happens again.

5 - the cow levitates 10 ft above the floor for the next minute

6 - with every step, flowers grow from the ground where the cows hooves just left. The cow seems bewildered by this, and if possible will stop to smell or try to eat the flowers.

7 - the cow turns into a stone statue for one minute, which is extremely heavy and difficult to move.

8 - in a 10 ft radius around the cow, extreme weather happens contrary to everywhere else. If it's a calm sunny day, there's a tornado, or torrential rain, or snow. This has no major effect other than to distract or inconvenience the players, such as sudden fog making it difficult to see. This effect lasts 10 minutes.



I think if the players put up with this cow for long enough to take it to the city and get it uncursed, I think they'll be able to remove everything but the dancing lights ability. Maybe this cow is just descended from the deep rothe, it seems nicely chaotic without effecting anything.

frghtj,P33NCrusader,Hi I‚Äôm new to the community and playing my first campaign!,"Hi all! 

I have to admit, D&amp;D was one of those things that used to never appeal to me. It wasn‚Äôt that i didn‚Äôt like it or thought it was lame, it just was never on my radar and i knew nobody who played so it was never even an idea. 

About 2 years ago, while finishing up my finals at uni, i discovered the headgum podcast network by getting back into Jake and Amir from collegehumor. Through this, I discovered Not Another D&amp;D Podcast. This gave me my first look into how interesting the games mechanics are and what you can do with the game. This made me know i wanted to play. 

I started a new job in the summer with some amazing people, some of who played D&amp;D and more who were interested. After discussions and some delays, i am finally playing my first campaign! I‚Äôm really enjoying it more than i ever expected and now that i‚Äôm getting used to the game and how it works, I‚Äôm having the time of my life. Now i have only played over group chats due to coronavirus quarantine but my DM is fantastic and really doing a good job at keeping it immersive. 

Since starting i have begun investigating the wider community and honestly, I‚Äôve been blown away with how creative and inspiring you all are. 

Long story short, this is a world (or endless possibility of worlds) that i‚Äôm so glad i have finally found my way into.",0,1585527318,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frghtj/hi_im_new_to_the_community_and_playing_my_first/,DnD,1
frgfwm,Brbikeguy,First time DM looking for large group one shots,"Okay so, unsurprisingly, this is seeming like a great time to do a virtual one off with some friends. I'd have a pretty big group, like 7 people, and obviously that alone will be dysfunctional and chaotic at best. We all know that, it's more about the fun of hanging out virtually than about it working well. 
I have played but have not DMed. I'd like to take the helm of this one so I was hoping for some suggestions of any good one shots that would work decently with large groups and a newbie DM. Sort of hoping for a leve aroundl 3  for a start, since the cool abilities of most classes are avaible them, but open to any level.

I saw something saying to come up with a slogan for your organization to help flesh them out. So, ""Our work lifts the smallest man to power"". However in my character's backstory he was a field medic so I like a secondary slogan of ""swinging swords make a strong army"" which would show the dedication to medicine I want FTOF to have. 

I like the idea of recruiting people who don't have other choices (Orphans, peasants, those with physical impairments) however I can see that quickly making the church corrupt.

frfyf4,GryffonGamez,"DMs of Reddit, What was that one NPC your players got overly attached to?","Mine was when my party went to see the Jarl of Gundam, who's palace also served as a brothle. The NPC in question was a 15 year old half elf girl who ran into one of my player's room. She was one of the prostitutes who was forced into prostitution by her mother, who was also a prostitute. I made the mother prostitute go to the chaotic evil player's room because I knew he'd kill her which is what I wanted. He threw her through the wall into the other player's room. The girl's name was Eyowyn and after her mother died, she realised she was free and went with the party. One time when the party was struggling with some robots in a dungeon, she burst into flames and killed the two remaining robots with magic out of nowhere. The party decided to go back to the palace brothel to ask the court mage, who was in charge of the prostitutes, to ask if he knew anything. It turns out that Eyowyn's father was my BBEG, kassai the half elf phoenix sorcerer and Jarl of Mageide(He also had a great backstory which I'll happily share), and the bursting into flames was her awakening her dormant powers. She continued her adventures with the party, learning from the party spell caster, until she started having pains. They went back to the Court Mage of the palace brothel, and he revealed she was pregnant and going into labor, by lifting an illusion he'd been holding for 9 months to hide the fact. He also revealed that 9 months ago, Kassai returned to the palace brothel and did the hokey pokey with Eyowyn, not knowing she was his daughter. It was clear she wouldn't survive the child birth so she lay on her bed and had individual moments with the party members to say goodbye. She then gave birth, and died in front of them. This, paired with the emotional song I also had playing, had me and the party in tears which was my proudest moment as a DM. The party was greatly impacted and dedicated the campaign on getting revenge on Kassai which also managed to rerail the campaign which they derailed. That was my proudest achievement and how I made one of the best villains in all our D&amp;D campaigns.

Alibris had a listing of ""fair to new"" books for about $23 and that seemed like a great deal, a dent wouldn't hurt I thought so I bought it. It's also worth noting that on the product listing it said there was a red marker dot on the bottom and that didn't seem that bad so like I said I bought it and waited. So I got it today and was hyped to get into it and for a few minutes it was great until I realized 33 pages of the book were missing. They weren't ripped out or anything besides a dent on the side and the dot it was relatively mint condition besides the missing pages. So basically they sent me a defective copy and passed it off for ""fair to new"" which is was ridiculous, so I'm sending it back and hopefully I get proper compensation I paid extra for quick shipping.

frett2,the_western_shore,I've finally reached a point that every DM fears,"It's been awhile since I started a new campaign. But since this quarantine has started, my group has decided to all put our regular games on hold, since we record them for a podcast. So I offered to start running a weekly game: every Wednesday, starting this week, we will get on Discord and I will run a game. Here's my issue: I've sat down to write Session 1, and I have nothing. I have my world built. I did that in like 45 minutes, it just flowed right out of me. But now I have no ideas for plots, partially cuz I have no idea what my PCs are gonna be. I told my group to get me their ideas by the end of the day. It's 6:30 in the evening here, and I have nothing from anybody (well, there was one idea, but I rejected it because the race he wanted doesn't exist in the world and didn't wanna change the race on the character). 

So I ask my fellow DMs, what do you do when you have a session to run in 3 days, but no ideas on what to do for plot? Obviously, session 1 is hardest as you're starting from the ground up.

fredfx,Atleast1half,I'm going to brag about the hp my warlock has.,"At level 5, with 16 con, my warlock has 51 hp.

Starting at level 1, with 11 hp i rolled a 7 at level 2, a 5, a 8 and another 8 thus far!

It's a melee focused hexblade, so I'm extremely pleased with those rolles.

But i leveling from 1 to 5, i did realize that i hate the warlock as a class, anything it does costs a evocation. 

You want to do anything outside of combat? Best spend those Evocations.

You want a second attack at level 5? That's a evocation.

You want to enhance your survivability without need for spending your precious slots? Spend evocation

I'm level 5 and I'm already running out of evocations on just the basics, compare that to a artificer who gets to make 2 magic items, has more slots, better attacks, a dope pet....

Anywho, glad i got this out of my system, but I'm not going to reroll/suicide by ogre, just yet, no need to suggest it down below.

I'll tell you a bit about Tharum Khardoson.

He is the oldest son of a renowned adventure and a nobleman's daughter. (that's another story) 

He grew up in luxury and grilling his father for stories and tales and exploits about his adventuring days, always wanting to know more, vowing to surpass his dad with the conviction only found in children and crazy people. 

But years passed and Tharum was send to a old friend of his dad to learn about jewel crafting.

Stuff happened and he found a magical sword.

Remembering the promise to his dad, he became a adventure. Thus far he's:

- committed goblin genocide for coin.
- pissed of a succubus 
- survived a ship crash 
- saved a baker from the LG Paladin (Chaotic stupid player) 
- summoned a deva.",14,1585519697,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fredfx/im_going_to_brag_about_the_hp_my_warlock_has/,DnD,2

frebqo,captainpsyche_,The Strangest Warlock I've Ever Seen,"This is gonna be long, so strap in. My party is made up of a halfling cleric named Rosemary Pippen, a tiefling rogue by the name of Remfield Monarch, a half-elf rogue named Aurora Ebonwood, two human fighters named Gerry Hammond and Dimitri Al-Gul, a gnome druid named Nyx Blakesley, and an adopted Kenku named Poe. This story isn't about them though; this is about our dwarven warlock Morgran Dankil. (If any of my party sees this: Thanks for being awesome (most of the time) and don't be too hard on me if the exact details aren't how you remember it.)

So the weird things about Morgran, he's neutral good. He's the only non-chaotic alignment in the party and it's strange that the warlock isn't evil or chaotic. He's also our tank with his 45 HP and 18 AC (The party is level 5). Morgran is also a fisherman. I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty sure there aren't many warlocks who fish as their main hobby. In fact, his backstory goes that he accidentally hooked the Midgard Serpent and drowned, but Brunhilde took pity on him before he was condemned to Helheimr. 

Morgran's PC is also our most experienced player. He's a very polite rules lawyer, which is actually kinda helpful to me as a scatterbrained DM trying to keep track of what at least 9 characters are doing. He also does the most roleplaying, so he's my wildcard player. All of my chaotic players I know are going to do something stupid, so I prepare for it, but I never know what to expect from Morgran, so enjoy some of our highlights while I wait for my players to give me some more info as to what they want to see in the next few sessions:

Session 1: Morgran decides to bring a sack of fish into the manor that will become their base. It ends up serving as a really effective distraction against the small horde of goblins that was in the basement. Later on, he asks to throw his net over the boss who had just been killed by our two fighters and tiefling rogue being antsy with their bows. I got to say this as a replacement for the cool fight I had planned, ""In the middle of his sentence, Lord Thorne suddenly sprouts three arrows from his chest and coughs up blood as he slumps over his desk. A fishing net then falls gracefully over his corpse.""

Session 2: The party has found a cursed chalice that has already created two doppelgangers that they had to kill. One of Dimitri and the other was Rosemary. Remfield decides to ask this question, ""Hey, Morgran, you still got those fish on you?"" ""Always."" They proceed to skin the fish and pick the chalice up using the fish skin as a glove. ""The chalice slips from your grasp as a fish with glowing red eyes appears and begins flopping around angrily."" At this point, they destroy the chalice, and someone asks if the shards hit any of them. One hits Nyx, and Morgran immediately punts the new doppelganger into the ceiling of the dungeon.

Session 3: This is where Poe comes in. The party is hiding behind a ridge planning their attack on the Na'argell cult (yes, that's a Harry Potter pun). At this point, Nyx has a bag of tricks, and Morgran has Beast Speech. He asks Nyx if she can get her Giant Elk out of the bag. She tries and succeeds. (By the way, the cult didn't notice this happening because they'd sent their cleric in to distract the cult by talking about Loki while disguised as one of them.) Morgran asks the Elk if he can get on its back. Elk obliges and Nyx joins him. I've now clued in on what's about to happen, and Morgran asks the elk his name. ""Ralph,"" he responds. Why? Because He's gonna wreck it. The elk then sprints into the clearing, bowling over nearly the entire cult as the rest of the party runs over the ridge. There's a pvp later on about sparing Poe. Morgran wins and Poe lives. 

Session 4: Morgran's PC asks for a wild magic surge because they're trying to destroy a large containment unit that is harvesting magic. Most of the party is turned invisible and the main enemy of this encounter is sent to the Ethereal Plane. They also had to split the party for this combat, so to synchronize their attack, the cleric cast Thaumaturgy to make her voice louder and shouted ""RED ROBIN!!"" The party then bursts through the doors screaming ""YUM!!"" 

Session 5: ""I'm gonna cast Blight on the Kraken's face to dry up its eye jelly."" And later on, ""HOW IS THE HALFLING WORTHY OF MJOLNIR, BUT I'M NOT?? MJOLNIR WAS FORGED BY DWARVES; THIS IS AN INJUSTICE!!""

Session 6: He rolled a nat 20 to fish. This turned into a 30+ minute 1v1 between Morgran and the Sea Serpent that dragged him off the party's ship. This was a session in which they were supposed to meet a recurring enemy again to finish her off. He also tried to pet Nidhoggr.

Session 7: Gerry's PC was DMing this one. The party was marooned on an island by some hirelings that wanted their help finding a sword that didn't exist. They met a Gold Dragon who pointed them in the direction of an abandoned ship and gave them a magic map. Morgran tried to talk to this dragon about fishing for several minutes. The dragon got bored and fell asleep.

Session 8: The party was interrogating a woman regarding some recent kidnappings, and Morgran decides to dive into the harbor to get a head start toward the island they were told to check out. HE SWIMS FIVE MILES. Once he arrives, he scouts out the island and Brunhilde tries to get his attention. His response to this was, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT, WOMAN??"" Brunhilde reprimands him for being rude and then explains the deal with the creepy temple. I used the word ""stone"" and he did that John Cleese as Tim the Sorcerer thing where he's like ""A grAAAIIILLL??"" but it's ""StoNE?? History Check on it."" Remfield also accidentally shot him once the rest of the party shows up.

freb9h,SallyKnockers,Players WANT to be punished- DM advice?,"I might have messed up in our session today. We're playing on roll20 due to corona which is kinda important later on.

My players (lv 2)were on their way from point A to point B when they had a random encounter with some wolves. Due to some really good rolls on my part, like 3 nat20s overall (and no possibility to soften the blows bc of roll20) it didn't take too long and 3/4 of the PCs were unconscious while the 4th one climbed up into a tree.

Now I put in some kind of failsafe if they should be overwhelmed by this encounter which seemed like a great idea at the time. Basically I wrote a note to myself that said ""if PCs take too much damage, deep raspy howl from a distance - wolves retreat"" so my players would know that there's something far more dangerous in these woods that can somehow command the wolves.

Like I said when I created the encounter and  this way out it seemed like a good idea but when it played out it just felt cheap and inconsequential. It just wasn't as fun as I wanted it to be. I talked to one of my players and he felt the same way and said that they maybe need some kind of punishment next session. I agree but I don't want it to be as obvious as the failed failsafe.

I thought maybe don't let them have a long rest so that they get levels of exhaustion but other than that I'm at a loss right now.

fre2v3,sbattis2,First try at roll20 complete! (Advice Needed!),"Hi all!

Well, I did my first attempt at DMing with roll20 today. It was a bit rocky, but that was to be expected: new AV technology (Zoom), new tabletop (roll20), and 5 new-to-DnD- players.

I ran into some technical/knowledge issues related to roll20, and wanted to ask some advice from the vets out there.

1. I used the advice in this article to create my monsters: [https://wiki.roll20.net/Running\_D%26D5e\_on\_Roll20](https://wiki.roll20.net/Running_D%26D5e_on_Roll20). This worked well during setup, because I could easily drag multiple copies of monsters from the journal to the page. But when I got into combat, I couldn't figure out how to use their abilities effectively. If I shift-double-clicked on any monster but the ""original,"" I couldn't open the character sheet, so I often had to go back to the journal to figure out their statistics/abilities. Presumably, this is because each monster token wasn't associated with that ""character,"" they were associated with ""None/Generic Token,"" but I thought I had to do that so that each token would have distinct HP etc. What did I set up incorrectly?
2. I'm unclear on how I'm supposed to start up combat. Should it be like this?
   1. Open turn tracker.
   2. Manually right-click on each monster and player character and select ""Add turn.""
   3. Ask players to roll initiative from their character sheets.
   4. Sort the turn order.
3. How do you roll saves for monsters?
4. Using the roll20 5e character sheets. Do they (or can they) calculate AC automatically? If so, how exactly does that work?

It seems when players click initiative BEFORE I do steps 2 and 3, it doesn't get added to the tracker, so I ended up just manually adding each roll myself, which was tedious. I also couldn't figure out how to roll initiative for the monsters except from the generic die roller.

I'm sure these things are easily solvable. Any recommendations?",8,1585518655,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fre2v3/first_try_at_roll20_complete_advice_needed/,DnD,1

frdoiw,Greyff,[OC][Setting]City/State for use,"&amp;#x200B;

AELFYRE, the Holy City

Population: 18,500 (55% elf, 25% dwarf, 15% half-elf, 5% other)

Third oldest City/State and an island of the Hegemony. It was founded in the Second Age of Man by Kehvahn Bloodbane, one of the Sorcerer-Kings of that time as a refuge from the wars of that time. One of the elven settlements that did NOT join the Elven Empire during the Third Age though they did not actively oppose that group until after the Blood Curse was used against the dwarves.

After that, Aelfyre was firmly opposed to the Elven Empire even though taking that stance marked them as enemies to what seemed to be the dominant portion of the elven race. The city had been over 90% elf prior to that, but non-elf refugees were welcomed - particularly dwarves. Dwarven engineers and crafters began building up the city defenses, human refugees contributed with alchemical knowledge and developing counters to the various plagues and soul-weapons employed by the Empire, and the elves continued to work magical defenses bolstered by the mages of Lobor.

Governance: High Priest of the pantheon is the usual mayor, currently the archfey Glimmershrike. Rule is by representitives from all temples meeting, with the mayor casting the deciding vote in case of deadlock.

Law &amp; Order: As one might expect with a Holy City dedicated to a pantheon which has members who are very different in philosophies from one another, the Holy City has a number of laws which are often in conflict. Horses and other beasts of burden/mounts are not allowed in the streets (or overhead) with only magical transport or rickshaws being permitted due to an incident known nowadays as The Night of Madness which is largely dismissed as myth by the common populace.

Defense: Split between the Knights of the Shield (spellcasting forces 20%), Knights of the Sword (higher level regular forces 30%), and Knights of the Spear (regular forces 50%) for city defense. Guild quarters and the more wealthy will also have bodyguards.

Commerce: Aelfyre is a largely self-sufficient and mostly isolationist community, feeling they have little in common with the other communities within the Hegemony. Nonetheless they will trade alchemical goods and some of the natively grown plants (nunannas, valefruit, rice) with islands that do not get so much rainfall.

Zone: The island of Aelfyre is located in a Zone (Abjuration magic functions at +2 (as if 2 levels higher) with Conjuration at -2) with rain on a daily basis except for a three-month dry season from Sixmoon to the beginning of Ninemoon. Heaviest rains occur during the end of Firstmoon.

NOTEWORTHY LOCATIONS:

Daggerhawk Hall: The noble family of Daggerhawk has been in Aelfyre since its founding and is a major backer of their naval forces. The family business is in trade, shipbuilding, and fishing and dominates particularly in the shipbuilding locally. Their sprawling estate was designed originally with a mind towards defense and it remains a fortress within the city itself.

Den of Inquiry: The library is only open to members, who pay an annual fee (varies as to level of access) to peruse the stacks. Books, scrolls, and records dating back thousands of years are stored at the Den. The staff here are mostly elves though rumors are that at least one of them (Tyler Moonsilver) is actually a shapechanged dragon.

Hawker's Plaza: the bazaar is an open plaza that fills from dawn to dusk with various stalls and tents and wandering salesmen that sell nearly everything except living creatures and undead. Trying to find a particular item can be a problem in itself but there are guides available for a few coppers that memorize the basics every morning. In any case, let the buyers beware as not all dealers are reputable.

The Octopus' Garden: An old inn and tavern near the waterfront. Specializes in cheap but filling fare, and is a particularly large inn for a city-based concern. Dates back to the late Second Age but has been rebuilt twice. The inn is haunted by Suhsahn Traysk, a human woman who worked as a maid and died on the eve of her wedding due to the bombardment of that city on that day. Her memories have faded away over the ages but she remains a pleasant young woman who mainly just shows up to listen when guests are telling stories about their lives and adventures.

Practical Potions: Off by itself is an odd building with four smokestacks, each of which has a different color of smoke streaming from it on most days. Practical Potions is in its third generation and is the single source for such oddities as Instant-Swamp and Bugs-Be-Gone among others. Experimental potions are frequently developed by the extended Addama family (25% elf, 75% half-elf) that most people of the city regard as ""brilliant but a bit dotty"" and are at a considerable discount for those who provide detailed records of the effects.

Sahlman's Pier: The waters off this dock are especially deep and were only recently cleared for use by general ships. Prior to this decision, a section was reserved for Fleet Operative Sahlman Hardlock and his mysterious submersible ship. The ship has not been seen for hundreds of years and is presumed to have sunk at this point. A memorial to Hardlock and his ship the Arkahdee giving his time as a privateer during the Second Age is at the head of that pier.

Triple Towers: Three long towers with bridges between them are the offices of the government, the security forces, and the administration bureau. Located in the center of the city, they are painted a brilliant white that is periodically renewed. During the Third Age, enchantments on the Towers would turn them and their contents transparent when an attack was expected but that magic was lost during one of the bombardments of the city during that conflict.

Zathrun's: The Immortal Zathrun, aka Zathrun Ironsouled, alias Zathrun the Heavy, is a fixture of the city. During the Third Age he'd managed to prepare a form of phylactery - and when he died defending the city was immediately reborn. The iron golem has no breath attack but has an Intelligence of 17 and is a Wizard of level 16, it otherwise conforms to the stats for an iron golem. After the amount of time that has passed, Zathrun's iron golem form is a bit battered and shows some signs of age. Zathrun is a maker of magical prosthesis and weapons of various type.

FESTIVALS:

Bombardment Day: a somber festival remembering the worst bombardment of the city in the Third Age when three invisible ships of the Elven Armada managed to slip past the patrols and enter into range of the island. Banefire was used, setting even the stone on fire and burning soil to ash. Two of the ships were sunk, one managed to retreat with damage. It is a day of rememberance where surviving families leave flowers at the ancestral markers found in homes. Sixth day of Sixthmoon.

Ale Day: On the last week of Tenthmoon is Ale Day, which contrary to the name lasts an entire week. Ales, beers, and alcohol of various other types are all on tap and celebrated in all their variety.

Day of Storms: There is a day (Twelfth day of Seventhmoon) that it storms. Every single year. All day. Nobody's quite sure why, though theories abound. Divination magic comes back with Zone effects and that there's a quest involved but nobody has ever found details.

ADVENTURE HOOKS:

Under The Sea: A map indicates the possible location of one of the elven ships that had been sunk during the Third Age. There is the possibility of items like Banefire cannisters which have survived the ages since then. Shipwrecks are going to be between 500ft and 1200ft down, making it access difficult even if the number of sea-going monsters don't make appearances.

Beauty &amp; The Beast: It's a tale as old as time. He's an impeccably dressed mage from a noble family, she's an accomplished warrior who grew up in the wilds and has a tendency to solve problems with an axe. Arranged marriage from before they were born, he's hiding somewhere after she showed up and threw him out a window when he remarked about her need for bathing. So he has to be found, she has to learn something about personal hygiene, and the family is hoping for some outcome that doesn't end up with death or dishonor.

Got No Strings: Wood golems have started making an appearance on the markets. Unfortunately, some of them ran amok. None of the purchased ones have done anything but exactly what they are advertised to do: perform simple tasks and learn - eventually mastering more and more complex tasks. For some reason these unclaimed golems are attacking people. The culprit is either a malicious ghost or a wizard who seeks to put the merchant out of business.

Colors Of The Wind: A flower from Monster Island has become a fad and is in flower boxes and private gardens all over the city. It is perfectly safe. Most of the time. The pollen released during one particular week in Fourmoon, however, turns out to be extremely poisonous at that time of year. It only affects elves and is strongly hallucinogenic with wildly different results depending on the individual. Will the PCs seek to save the city or take advantage of the chaos?

Silver Orchid pollen effects: elves or fae only. Constitution save DC 16 to throw off, otherwise lasts for 1d6 hours. If affected roll 1d20 for hallucination or mood-altering effect:

1 - Colors are scrambled. 2- Sees everyone else as monsters. 3 - the walls are melting. 4 - everything is melting. 5 - shadows contain cthulhu-esque horrors. 6 - character can't stop laughing, everything is funny. 7 - character is extremely amorous. 8 - character acts as if they are in a musical production, dancing and singing their way through every interaction. 9 - blinded for duration. 10 - an effect similar to being extremely intoxicated. 11 - a peaceful easy feeling, complete passivity. 12 - character thinks they have been polymorphed into a duck or other small animal. 13 - extreme dizziness. 14 - character sleeps through the entire thing. 15 - character is convinced they are a tree or other form of non-mobile plant. 16 - character suffers from extreme mood swings and will be unable to take any action other than laughing, crying, screaming, or hiding in a corner. 17 - character regresses mentally to young child for duration. 18 - paralyzed for duration. 19 - rampaging paranoia. 20 - character is convinced gravity has been cancelled and must cling to nearest object to avoid falling into the sky.",1,1585517252,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frdoiw/ocsettingcitystate_for_use/,DnD,1

frdk19,PickerPilgrim,[Question] How to handle failed ability checks as a DM?,"I‚Äôm a first time DM running a campaign for mostly first time players. (5e: Dragon of Icespire peak). I‚Äôm wondering how other DMs handle failed ability checks.

Say a player fails a roll for persuasion. Should I let other members of the party try to persuade the NPC, or just let the NPC get cranky and tell them off? What if they try again?

How about climbing a 20 ft wall. How many failed athletic checks before I make them move on?

When they‚Äôre searching a dungeon for treasure or secret passages, I‚Äôve been asking for perception checks even where there‚Äôs nothing to be found because I figure if I only make them roll when there is something, then they‚Äôll know that‚Äôs where the goods are. I‚Äôve also been letting them keep trying when they get bad rolls, but maybe making it take up time. But this seems to result in kind of a roll until you get it situation.

Am I going about this wrong? It occurred to me after yesterday‚Äôs session that maybe it‚Äôs not so bad to tip off my IRL players where the loot is, but that I need to emphasize that their characters don‚Äôt know they got a bad roll and would/should move on when they don‚Äôt find things. Like maybe both me and my players are forgetting that they aren‚Äôt their characters.

I realize there‚Äôs probably not a hard and fast answer here but I‚Äôd appreciate any strategies and suggestions people might have.",20,1585516796,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frdk19/question_how_to_handle_failed_ability_checks_as_a/,DnD,2

frdgqe,KingPecan,Thoughts on my Pacifist Character? (Warning kinda long),"Ok, so the basic story of the character is that he starts out as a happy go lucky monk of Edalth (deity of peace, waterfalls, tranquility), he had lived at the temple for almost his entire life and swore never to harm another living creature and never use violence as a solution. But one day his temple was attacked by bandits and a nasty cult. After seeing the slaughter of his friends, something in him broke. He killed as many of them as possible but either ran or away or was tortured by them (haven't decided). But eventually, he realizes he can no longer connect with Eldath and had fallen. He wandered the world for a while before finding a small temple of Illmater, (deity of life, martyrdom, peace) where the clerics there took him in. After some soul-searching (maybe literally) he gets a sign from Illmater in form of a Red cord. He chose to follow Illmater based on his views on fighting (basically, never start fights and avoid violence as much as possible but if you need to, you can strike down the most wicked with righteous fury, and anyone can be redeemed). After tying the cord to his arm, he ventured off to the world again with his new mission and (hopefully) eventually redeeming himself. Regaining his status of a Protector Aasimar and becoming a Devout follower/Paladin/Monk of Illmater.

TLDR Naive pacifist Aasimar Monk falls/breaks his oath and becomes a righteous Paladin/Monk of Martyrdom.

frdgpy,EquinoxMaiden,New GM dealing with her first Mary Sue Player," 

Hello everyone! so.. i need help LOL

This is my first campaing as a game master, i've played dnd before as a players and since i had no game master to play with i decided to be my own game master, gathering a bunch of friend with no experience as players as well to play with me. Yesterday i chatted with all the players to know what they were planning for their characters and to help them build their character sheets, since its their first campaing and all, but one of them is concerning me...  
Most of the backstories were fine, simple and open for work in the story, but one of them, Anakis, is too perfect for my taste. Her mother is a half breed between an angel and a demon, her father (tiefling) and mother fleed from the village for the consequences of their love and child, dying tragically protecting her. Then she was found by two bestial druids (a white and black panthers, respectivaly), who raised her as their own, she grows (has a bat pet because bestial druids parents), them flees to the city and meet a great Sourcerer that not only knows about her family, teaches her to be THE greatest sourcerer of the kingdom. She is VERY beatifull, sassy, don't trust easily the others, VERY charismatic, and her flaw is that she is a little rebel and very sttuborn.

They will all start the game at lvl 1... it would make no sense to be this good at level one! I tried to warn her about it, and she sounded very defensive of her creation (which i undestand) but as the game master i feel i should edited her a little more.

Should i talk directetly to her or maybe try to fix it during game? idk if im the one beeing too picky, i dont want to ruin her fun, she is my friend, but i dont want to be unfair by making the story about her.

Ps: sorry for any mispelling, english is not my firs language

ps2: this is my first post here as well, i didnt find any new trend about it so i decided to start a new one, sorry if there were one already",20,1585516459,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frdgpy/new_gm_dealing_with_her_first_mary_sue_player/,DnD,3

frdd24,Lovesdragons,Tyranny of Dragons/Descent into Avernus evil campaign,"For the first campaign I‚Äôm dming I was asked by a close friend who wanted to play an evil character red dragonborn cleric of Tiamat using a home brew subclass for dragon domain. Four others showed interest in running this campaign and after my friend explained his character the others wanted to do the other chromatic colors of dragonborn since there were five of them total. Upon realizing they were all after the same goal I finally finished laying out the structure for an evil campaign spanning the tyranny of dragons, descent into avernus and a hybrid of descent into avernus/scales of war campaign. Shifted the npcs, quests, factions and campaign goals to match what it would be like for the party to want to aid Tiamat in escaping avernus and fighting the various factions of the sword coast alongside its heroes and adventurers leading to a final confrontation against Bahamut in a scenario similar to the final mission of scales of war. Had to adapt quite a bit to fit an evil party and how they would interact with other factions, beyond this however I found it very easy to convert situations. 
The characters
Red dragonborn cleric dragon domain
Blue dragonborn cleric tempest domain
Black dragonborn paladin oath of conquest
White dragonborn barbarian zealot path
Green dragonborn warlock pact of the fiend

Long story short, my players will be dependant of a single weapon and I'd like that weapon to have specific skills fit for it.

If there's something you don't understand I can help because I've been looking for something like this for a long time.

So, does anyone maybe have a list of spells made for each weapon, including stuff like Scythes and Guitars? It can even be from some other game as long as it is made specifically for a weapon and explains what the skills does, I can adapt skills quite easily into D&amp;D.

frczxk,wellesdel,Help Me Choose Which Character to Play As,"I'm currently having trouble deciding between two very different characters. 

One is a goblin charlatan &amp; merchant that sells fake medicine. He is pretty snobby/uptight counter to his goblin heritage (he makes people call him a ""doctor"" for example). He knows his potions don't work but admires himself for working his way up in the world.

I feel like the Goblin character would be difficult to play, and maybe I should make him chaotic over uptight?

The other is a Half-Orc sorcerer that is ashamed of his magic and wants everyone to think he is a fighter/ typical violent orc character. The Orc uses fire magic but has difficulty controlling it. The magic comes out when he is feeling strong emotions, and can be warm or destructive depending.

I'm more interested in the character personalities than I am in stats.

I also don't mind going against typical race-class combinations.

frcvnh,RadionRed,DM Wants To Nerf My Character - Is He Right?,"My DM claims my character is too OP and wants to nerf it. Is he right about this or not and is there a better way to nerf it a little?

I play a DMG Eladrin Fighter 1 / Bladesinger 12 with stats of 12/19/18/20/15/12 which are very strong, but rolled for as the DM allowed at creation and including bumping stats since then.

He also allowed me to buy a Cloak of Protection a few levels ago. I'm wearing studded leather.

The issue is that with defense fighting style, the cloak, and Bladesinger things, my base AC is 20 (12+dex+1+1+2) without bladesinging with a shield and AC of 23 (12+dex+int+1+1) bladesinging without the shield. Of course, I can shield spell to bump them to 25/28 respectively or haste up to 27/30, but I haven't ever used haste yet. Basically means you have to nat20 to hit me.

My saves are 7/5/10/5/3/2 which are rather strong. 

And I have Elvish Accuracy so I basically never miss.

Normally for a Bladesinger, they're basically impossible to hit with a targeted attack so you hit them with saves and AoEs, but my saves are decent enough where I've got a fighting chance to pass most saving throws.

Some people would say that even with my saves and AC, any attack that slips past and lands or any save that I even take half damage from a sucessful save would really hurt because of my d6 hit die, which would be true except that with my first level in fighter and my 18 in con, I'm sitting at 115hp.

My AC is the highest by a mile, my saves are stronger than most of the party, my hp are second only to the druid/barb.

Our party has an elf druid, a dragonborn monk, a half-elf rogue/cleric, a tiefling druid/barb, a half-orc paladin, a tabaxi rogue/bard, and a half-orc warlock.el 13, so my DM didn't have a problem with me being impossible to hit and hitting every time because I didn't do much damage. However, for RP reasons I haven't been casting very much so he hasn't seen that side of things. Last session I cast Tenser's Transformation and began dual-wielding scimitars for 3d6+6d12+12 (66) per round.

This really bugged the DM as he couldn't hit me with targeted attacks, saves against me weren't guaranteed either, even AoEs wouldn't hurt that bad because of my massive hp pool, I hit every single time and deal 66 dpr.

&amp;#x200B;

He wants to nerf my character by giving me a hard AC cap of 23, meaning I can't use shield spell or hate because those bump me above 23, I can't get 20 in dex because those also bump me over, I can't use mage armor for the same reason, and I can't pick up any magic items that increase AC because I'm already at 23.

With my rapier and GFB, I regularly output 3d8+4 (19) and 2d8+5 (15) if there's a second enemy nearby. That's only 34 damage per round which isn't much at level 13, so my DM didn't have a problem with me being impossible to hit and hitting every time because I didn't do much damage. However, for RP reasons I haven't been casting very much so he hasn't seen that side of things. Last session I cast Tenser's Transformation and began dual-wielding scimetars for 3d6+6d12+12 (66) per round.

&amp;#x200B;

My DM claims that my character is so OP that I could likely take down the whole party by myself, which I dissagree with. He said that he's planning encounters around my character and not the whole party like he should be. He also said that any hard or deadly encounter for the party is moderate or easy for my character.

He wants to nerf my character by putting a hard AC cap of 23, which means no shield spell, no haste spell, no mage armor, no other AC increasing spells, no increasing dex from 19 to 20, no more magic items that bump AC because all of these would make me go over AC 23.

He also wants to nerf me by saying that dual-wielding ends bladesong. He agrees that it's not ""using two hands for an attack"" like the bladesinger class says, but for nerfing purposes that's what he's ruling.

He also wants to keep me from taking any magic items or feats in the future that boost my saves or AC.

&amp;#x200B;

Is he right? My character does seem very strong, but everything is 100% by the books and he's allowed it until the last session when I started pulling out bigger spells. Is he right to nerf me or is there some better way to resolve this?",50,1585514427,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frcvnh/dm_wants_to_nerf_my_character_is_he_right/,DnD,2

frcc24,Klitoryo,DnD Discord Optimizations - HELP!,"Hi all! 

First of all, sorry for my bad english.

Me and my friends were just starting to play DnD for the first time. Our DM is the only one who has experience playing the game. 

We just finished Ch.1 of Lost Mine of Phendalver, and let me tell you, we are absolutely having a blast. 

But since we are all newcomers to the game, the playtime stretches because of us asking questions, about spells, actions, effects etc.

We exclusively play on Discord because all of us have jobs and can't really find the time to get together and play personally.

Our DM uses Discord's screen sharing tool to cast the map, character and enemy postions and we are currently using Avarae plug-in for dice rolls only, but we know this plug-in can do so much more. We just don't know how to use it.   


We are all working in the multimedia/film industry, so the visuals and audio effects are not really a problem for us. As we make our maps and assets giving it our own twists!

Is there any tips and tricks you can share on how to actually optimized our server for Character Database and updater, action and damage computations etc. and how to actually set it up? So that we can lift the load of our backs and focus on immersion and storytelling. 

Thank you in advance and we hope in playing with you people soon.

frc2t2,AstroNat20,"I told my players I was fudging dice rolls, but only on the 4th natural 20","I, a brand new DM, put my 4 players into combat with about 6-7 avatars of death at 1st level. It was not a difficult encounter at all, seeing as the creatures could be defeated in about one hit, but could almost knock out a PC in one hit themselves. However, I started to see that the first fight of the campaign could turn into a TPK as the enemies began rolling critical hits. Not wanting to see my homebrew campaign die in the third session, and wanting to keep the players in the game, I fudged the rolls into either hits or misses at random. Well, that was until I rolled the 3rd or 4th nat 20 in a row and couldn't hold it back any longer. I had to tell my players about the *ridiculousness* that was happening behind the screen. They didn't react negatively at all.

Now, it may seem that I'm being easy on my players, but keep a few things in mind:

1. This was the first fight and the third session of the first campaign I've ever ran, and I even made the campaign and the world.

2. The odds are stacked against them in the campaign:  
\-They're at the very edge of an area of the map that the campaign centers around. One that people do not return from.  
\-I'm using homebrew rest rules, meaning that they can only heal using half their hit dice via short rest, can only heal using hit dice via long rest, and must take 3 to 5 days of rest to heal automatically, for a little extra realism.  
\-I'm also going to be using massive damage rules and lingering wounds rules, also for realism's sake.

Well, what are your opinions?",10,1585511676,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frc2t2/i_told_my_players_i_was_fudging_dice_rolls_but/,DnD,5
frc20t,imthatpeep100,"Trying to defeat an ""earth Hydra""","Today, I have given my players their first real tough beast (wasn't decreasing HP or such). A hydra for five 5 level adventurers. They were worried when they realized what it was, and it was the first time they ran (*as mentioned in session 0, difficulty of scenarios vary so they knew this would come some day).* The beast is guarding a diamond they're trying to get so they can resurrect a friend, so instead of them just finding buried treasure, I made an earth hydra. The only change I made is that it digs instead of swim.

Their first time with the creature was not pretty. It's first hit nearly down their barbarian and it downed the warlock when he ran away with the diamond (trying to distract, but the hydra hunted him down and killed him in one attack since it got up to 8 heads). No one died and just ran away to regroup. 

Currently, my players are drawing out ideas and having their characters make a plan. They're incorporating fire, using small/medium balistas on the ship they ""acquired"" (long story). They know time is somewhat tight since their friend has gentle repose (7 days left) and it takes a day to get to the treasure/hydra land. 

I hope this helps teach them that not every encounter (especially combat) is to run in and attack to the death. They are having to problem solve and think things out more. This is also teaching myself to not go easy. I get so guilty when killing PCs (especially when there are character or story archs for them). But it is more fun when that risk of death is more apparent and everything isn't do easy.

frbv3j,eilon_x_,Am I the problem?,"well I'm DMing for a bunch of friends. because I am a student and I don't have a lot of time we decided to play a player driven campaign as in they players lead the campaign, the main story is shaped by them(as in there won't be a storyline they can't really affect like in modules-they choose what to do and their story will be what they choose, simillar to CR) but it always seems like they are not responsive.

when I try to set up sessions - no one is answering and we cancel last minute a lot. - I say to myself, everyone has their things to do, can't be upset. happens to most groups.

when I ask them to write backstories some do it (I am not complaining about those players) some say that backstories aren't needed for a campaign while other say stuff like ill do it later (and never do it) or when we will get somewhere that is connected to my backstory ill write one, we will never get there.

I try to help them understand the game better and get a grasp on what the world has to offer by suggesting they make a backup character ( so they know other classes and races) they refuse, saying that when their character dies they will try to make a new one.

they try to change the rules to help themselves ( saying that a large creature like a cow can stand in an acid pool the is 1 tile without taking damage and that enemies should be able to target players down or attack through other enemies)

but worst of all in my opinions, they mostly don't respond to anything. I'll ask them what they want to see in the campaign - no answer, how much would they like law to be a factor - no answer, where do they wanna go next - no answer, should we go online because of Covid-19 or cancel the campaign for the next couple of months - no answer. I don't know how to get to them or if I should.

I recently joined an online group for a quarantine game and it took us 1 hour to finish up all the characters and connections between them and start playing.

frbk19,AntisocialDyll,Need some guidance since I'm a noob.,"I've tried the DMing lifestyle a couple of times and no matter how much I read into things about how to DM, I'm still learning new stuff I didn't think I could do.

One example would be how enemies were positioned on a battlefield. For whatever reason, I always felt like they needed to have a predetermined location from where they emerge. But now I'm starting to realize that I can just have them ""appear"" out of whatever nook or creative location that best fits the enemy. This is still one problem I deal with.

Some other instances include not being able to figure out how to progress time correctly. What I mean more or less in pacing of the story. Should I progress time accordingly or should it just happen when its convenient? A good example would be like the beginning of Strager Things with the Demogorgon with the group arguing on what to do and how Mike was willing to rush in (if it was only to scare them into a decision or going out of rotation) and attack the group for wasting too much time.

Can the DM fudge rules around enough to make the game engaging? Like I've read that if you have groups of monsters that are the same, treat them as a group when rolling attacks. Ive ran into battles where no one either get hit from the enemies low rolls, or they suddenly get rushed with a barrage of attacks from a group. Should I have these groups smaller or just have individual rolls?

I know the DM is the final say so in these ways, and I'm sure I overthink a lot of these little gimmicks that are in the game. I just want a fair gameplay experience that still work out for the rules of 5e.

I know I have more issues I cant seem to remember unless they happen during actual DMing.",9,1585509869,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/frbk19/need_some_guidance_since_im_a_noob/,DnD,4

frbiwe,stormgiantgames,Crowd Control Expo [OC],"The TTRPG community and its small businesses need our patronage now more than ever. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, we saw the TTRPG community beginning to struggle. ‚Å£  
‚Å£  
Groups are unable to get together for games, businesses are struggling to make sales and conventions are being cancelled. We quickly began looking for ways to support our fellow small businesses in the community. ‚Å£  
‚Å£  
We realized - it‚Äôs the 21st century! We‚Äôve got so many resources at our disposal! So we decided to create a ‚Äúdigital expo‚Äù of sorts. A place that our friends in the TTRPG community could go to learn more about the small businesses that are creating goods for their favorite hobby. A place where small businesses could list their goods and services and hopefully reach a wider audience. ‚Å£  
‚Å£  
If we accomplish anything, we only hope hope that by providing a space where you can connect with each other we will make a small impact in keeping our favorite businesses on the map.‚Å£  
‚Å£  
Here are some things you can look forward to:‚Å£  
‚Å£  
\- Digital booths where you can browse and shop creations from small TTRPG businesses around the world. ‚Å£  
\- A Zoom lobby where you can hang out and interact with fellow TTRPG players. ‚Å£  
\- Live streaming games. ‚Å£

fray69,canopenersforhands,Dunamancy for Non-Dunamancers: Expanded,"If you're anything like me, you may have been thrilled to see Matt Mercer's dunamancy spells in *Explorer's Guide to Wildemount* but frustrated that the book didn't provide more specific guidance on which spells would be appropriate for the restrictions 5E's designers levied upon each class's spell list. You basically get a paragraph saying, ""Hey, you can think up ways to give characters access to these."" Like, gee, thanks for telling me something I already knew.

HOWEVER, I really like the spells and wasn't going to let a chance to let my anal-retentive nature go unsatisfied. To that end, I took a detailed look at each dunamantic entry, seeing which classes had access to similar spells, contrasting it against Wizards' stated guidelines for each class's spell roster, and (of course) considering its implicit flavor. To that effect, I give you the following list of dunamantic spells, presented by class and in alphabetical order. I'd be more than happy to explain my reasoning for any of them. B'day!

fraps0,-Zero_0-,Jack of All Trades,"So a player in my group is a bard and has the Jack of All Trades trait that comes with the class. I‚Äôve seen two versions of JOAT. One says that you can only add half proficiency bonus to any roll that you aren‚Äôt proficient in, and the other says if you spend 30 minutes training a skill, weapon, or armor that another person is proficient in and willing to train you in you become half proficient with those skills. 

My bard previously told me that he was proficient in every armor class and weapon because of JOAT which doesn‚Äôt seem right and I‚Äôm afraid if I correct him he‚Äôd just add to his backstory that he trained for years in all of them.

frans7,NorthGiraffe,Timelord Regeneration Mechanic: Does this system work? What could be improved or tweaked?,"*The Idea*: Timelord Regeneration for a variant race of humans. Players using this mechanic for their character could save themselves from death by repairing the dead cells of their body, at the cost of changing their face and personality. They have a set number of lives at their expense, and once they reach their last life, they are incapable of regenerating further. While timelords normally have thirteen lives, for this example I am going to say that the Player has ***FIVE LIVES*** instead of Thirteen.

*The Mechanic*: When a player has reached 0 hit points, they have a limited amount of time before the regenerative process starts. As stated in the 1996 TV Movie Featuring the Eighth Doctor, The Regenerative Process can be [destroyed](https://youtu.be/IXT-iZNbQwM?t=46). We are going to implement that as a feature for regeneration, so there is actually a risk to the player dying. More on that in the rules with the afterward.

**Modern Style Regeneration**: Like the style of the Ninth Doctor, Tenth Doctor, and Twelfth Doctor

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8nxbzfr32np41.gif

If the player is dead for less than two minutes before being revived, resuscitated, healed, etc. They will ***not*** regenerate. If they are dead for over two minutes, but less than five minutes, they will enter what is known as the ***STATE OF GRACE*** period. The State of Grace period is a period of time before the start of the regeneration where the player will be in a state of pre-regeneration. The State of Grace will allow the player to withstand minor inflicted damage, healing from cuts, bruises, and minor physical trauma. However, the more damage they take, the more violent they risk the regeneration being. They are also able to hold the regeneration back every five minutes for a maximum of fifteen minutes if they roll a high constitution roll. However, this too affects the actual regeneration itself. The longer it is held back, the more violent and explosive the regeneration will be. To a point where it may affect the player during the ***Post-Regenerative*** trauma. The more the regeneration is held back though, the more it affects the player's *dexterity*, as the player will gradually struggle to hold back the regeneration as it attempts to force itself astart. If the player chooses to start regeneration immediately after revival, they will get the style of Modern Regeneration akin to that of [Matt Smith's regeneration into Peter Capaldi](https://youtu.be/4F84WapAH7M?t=195), or as I call it, *The Sneeze Regeneration*. The Sneeze Regeneration isn't harmful to those around you, it's quick, subtle and over in the snap of a second. If the player holds it back for ten minutes, they'll get the [Christopher Eccleston to David Tennant](https://youtu.be/qa3NM9Jhkn0?t=135) style of regeneration. This isn't too terribly harmful to those around you, but they may want to take a few steps back, as it's not as subtle as the Sneeze Regeneration, but it's quite intense. Finally, if the player holds it back for longer than ten minutes, and chooses to regenerate at the fifteen-minute mark, they get the [David Tennant to Matt Smith](https://youtu.be/_68Vyc24i1s?t=200) style of regeneration. This is the most intense form of regeneration. It blows friend and foe alike off their feet, can cause windows to explode and even start fires if you're in an enclosed space. It lasts the longest and can cause the most harm in the post regenerative state. 

**The State of Grace, cont.**  
Saying goodbye is hard, however, while brief, you will get time to say goodbye. However, that time is shortened depending on how long you hold back the regeneration.  How long you have to say goodbye varies.

*The Sneeze Regeneration* \- Starts immediately after revival. You have four minutes to say goodbye before Regeneration begins and you change into a new man (or woman). Give your friends the rundown of what's going to happen, reflect on your time with them, give them hope that the next man won't let them down.   
*The Eccleston/Tennant Regeneration* \- Gives you one minute to say goodbye, a quarter version of the sneeze, but fair, as you've been holding back the regeneration for ten minutes. Reflect on your time, give your parting words, and embrace change.   
*The Tennant/Smith Regeneration* \- It gives you ten seconds to say your last words before you're engulfed in the fiery flames of change. You've been holding it back for fifteen minutes, you may not want to go, but it's time to accept change and embrace the new man (or woman).

**Classic Style Regeneration** \- Like the Style of First, Third, Fifth and Sixth Doctors.

https://i.redd.it/u9yozei3bnp41.gif

If the player is dead for longer than two minutes, but shorter than five, than they've just narrowly escaped death. They'll no longer have the strength to stand, and barely have the strength to talk, but the regeneration process will begin regardless. No strength to hold it back, and only seconds to say goodbye. The State of Grace is thrown to the wind here. However, unlike modern regenerations, classic regenerations do provide for a unique spin on the concept, to make them unique enough. There are a few styles of regeneration that depend on the life you're on, and one based on luck alone. Let's get into them.

[The Hartnell/Troughton Regeneration](https://youtu.be/pmXoHKzp4Lc?t=6) *-* You're style of classic regeneration that you get if you've died for the first time, and are regenerating for the first time. After waking up after regeneration, you'll have a minute's worth of dizziness, painful ringing in your ear, and a very hard time recalling who you are or where you are.   
[The Pertwee/Baker Regeneration](https://youtu.be/bz5kwyuywfg?t=4) \- The Style of classic regeneration you'll get for your Second, Third and Fourth lives. It's the longest of the three (*excluding the fourth, of course*) and causes the synapses to overclock themselves. For one minute, the player's mind will struggle to be in the now. They'll mention things from the past, previous conversations they've had, they'll be delirious, and will immediately sink into the Unconsciousness state of the *post-regenerative trauma* (More on that later).  
[The Baker C./Mccoy Regeneration](https://youtu.be/4_OT2obe710?t=48) \-  The shortest of the three, immediately throwing the player into the unconsciousness state of regeneration, allowing them to wake up fifteen minutes after the change if they wish to ride out the rest of the post regenerative trauma. Or they can sleep the rest of it off.

Now, this last one is called the ***GAMBLE regeneration*** and has the style of the [Davison/Baker C. regeneration](https://youtu.be/kAlSS3kxqgU?t=82). This regeneration is obtained through *luck*. *If the player has been dead for longer than* ***FIVE MINUTES****, but shorter than* ***ten minutes***, and revival techniques are used on them, they are required to make an additional saving throw. If the saving throw lands, the regenerative process will begin. It'll be the most difficult for the player to go through post-regeneration, but it's the longest. It causes hallucinations prior to the change. It's the only regenerative process to leave the player completely exhausted after. If you manage to regenerate using the gamble regeneration, you'll have a completely different version of post-regeneration trauma.

***Post-Regenerative Trauma****: Becoming a new person and resuming your adventure.*

https://i.redd.it/i92v2x3zanp41.gif

Finally! We've gotten to POST REGENERATIVE TRAUMA. You've just died and regenerated! So what happens now? Well, the first thing you have to do is ride out your post regenerative trauma. What's that? Well, let's say you move into a new house. You need time to figure out how it's all going to look, need time to adjust, need time to map it all out! That's what Post-Regenerative trauma is. It's not the easiest thing to ride out, but there are all sorts of different ways you can handle it, excluding the *Gamble Regeneration*, but more on that later. Let's get on to how you can recover from Post Regenerative Trauma! 

**Sleep it off** \- Take a nap. Take time to adjust to your new body, look at your new face for a bit and then pass out! Chances are you'll be out for the rest of your session, as sleeping it off takes about two hours, but it's worth it. Once you wake up, you won't have to deal with any identity dilemmas or brain side-effects that come with post-regeneration. If you plan to use sleeping it off as a way to leave the session early, then just make sure you have your DM give you the recap when you join back up. However! If you sit in on the rest of the session, you can choose to wake up at any moment, but you'll have to ride out the rest of your Post-Regenerative trauma for however long you have left. This method is the most recommended, as sleep is essential to the regenerative process. 

**Sleep is for the weak!** \- So, you want all the chaos that comes with the post regenerative trauma? Fine! If you choose not to sleep it off, every thirty minutes you'll have to roll a dexterity check. Anything lower than fifteen will cause you to pass out for a maximum of ten minutes. Make sure you have a friend with you, so they can keep you out of harm's way should you pass out. Wouldn't want you getting a knife to the gut while you're passed out. Along with the dexterity check, you will be highly irritable. You're confused, still figuring yourself out, your brain is still on metaphorical fire. You're probably going to lose your train of thought more than usual. Something that can be compared to this, is being drunk. Maybe buzzed. You're figuring yourself out, and while you'll calm down over time, you're more focused on figuring yourself out over resuming the quest or overcoming whatever trial might be in the party's way this time. You'll exhale golden dust every now and then, but that's only to let the party know you're still cooking. 

*Post Regeneration Trauma* ***Temporary*** *Advantages and Boosts* \-  
While in the post-regeneration state, assuming you are awake and alert, you'll have fifty extra HP for the three hours of PRT, and every ten minutes, should you be without some HP, you'll regenerate ten HP's via a golden glow around your hands that'll cause you to exhale golden dust from your mouth. This HP refill won't stop until you're back to full health, bonus HP included. Once PRT ends, you'll lose the extra HP. You'll have +2 to dexterity, as you're rejuvenated and full of energy and ready to take on the world. 

***""Change my Dear! And not a moment too soon!""*** *-*   
Becoming a new person is hard, finding your identity in a chaotic world (or whichever world your DM and party have built around you) is hard! You'll be the same person you were, but your personality is tweaked. You'll have to roll for a new personality, but your base stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, etc.) will be the same. You can either roll for a random appearance or make a whole new one yourself depending on what personality you get. You don't change class or race, but you can change your gender, ethnicity, accent, height, weight, hair, skin and eye color. You can be old or thin, fat or old, but just make sure your appearance matches your personality. Or don't! Be like the Sixth Doctor if you want! Sassy bitch wrapped in rainbow colors!

**The POST REGENERATION TRAUMA (*****Gamble Regeneration version*****) -**   
Gamble Regeneration has a very different form of Post Regenerative trauma, that actually harms the player more than gives an advantage. During the Post Regenerative Trauma, the player can enter what is known as a state of ""***Regeneration failure***"" in which over-exertion can cause the body to struggle with the process of regeneration. Gradually, over time, the player will begin to *LOSE 10 HP every twenty minutes,* which is opposite the effect of regular PRT and the player will temporarily have 50 less HP. If their HP reaches Zero before the 3-Hour PRT finishes, the player will die, and will not enter the regenerative state. The best method to counter Regeneration Failure is to Sleep it off. In a state of sleep, the player will not lose 10 HP over time. If you, however, cannot find a place to sleep it off, another alternative is meditation. Your meditation will have to be undisturbed, as at any point if you wake up, the HP drain clock will begin again. It is not recommended you try and perform the second method to regular PRT during a failure, as the struggle to stabilize is harder on the player, going so far as to give them a -2 in Dexterity AND constitution. 

**Timelord Regeneration - Basic Rules and Afterword.** 

https://preview.redd.it/0ock68yejnp41.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=affa1f4122f0114a279279cbedd5052e66d449f8

Thanks for reading all of this! I hope it wasn't boring! I'm just going to include some BASIC RULES for Regeneration and an afterword where I leave my own concerns and comments, asking for input on what could be improved or changed to better suit a DM and a game. I know it's weird to include Rules at the end with the afterword, but I didn't want to mess the formatting up by adding it somewhere earlier. Anyways!

\- **The State of Grace is** ***not*** **Invincibility**: When you are revived, the state of grace can repair *minor injuries and wounds* at the cost of ***intensity***, but if you're HP hits ***ZERO*** *during* the State of Grace, your regeneration will begin *by force*! And your enemies will have the opportunity to kill you! Example [here](https://youtu.be/j_Z-8FKN_lw?t=84)! My advice is to hold back the regeneration as long as you can if you're in a dangerous position, or regenerate knowing you're in a safe space! The changing process (face morph) itself actually takes one whole turn to complete. Once you end your turn, the change begins.

\- **Regeneration does not change race**! If you are a variant human, you stay a variant human. Regeneration can not change you from a variant human into a lizard person.

\- You can ***die*** during post-regeneration trauma. Such as the case with Regeneration Failure, or if your HP hits Zero again during PRT, you'll die for good. 

\- If the player is dead **longer** than ***ten minutes***, they're dead for good. The regenerative process will be destroyed and regeneration will not be able to start. While the chance of a gamble regeneration is there between the five and ten marks, regeneration can still start. Although, it requires a saving throw.

**Concerns, comments, and final thoughts-**

framyp,Marshmallowboats,How do you get over anxiety roleplaying?,"I'm completely new to DnD but I really do love it so far, hanging out with everyone each session is so much fun and I love creating a story together, seeing what happens, etc.

The thing is it seems to make me really really anxious. We were on a discord call today (thanks quarantine) and that seemed to make it worse- I just started crying?? For no reason?? (they couldn't hear and thankfully it wasn't a video call lol). There was also a point where someone asked what my character was going to say and my brain just glitched and I couldn't answer at all. It felt horrible, and then I was just getting frustrated with myself for (a) not being able to do things (b) messing up other people's game by not being a good player, which made it worse of course.  

I think it's a mixture of needing to think on the spot but not feeling like I have enough experience to know what to do, being expected to say stuff as my character, and my own fears about embarrassing myself. I know no-one would judge me or anything like that, it's entirely my own insecurities, but I guess I just have such a complex about seeming cringey or laughable to people that I didn't properly realise I had until now.

Did anyone else start out with similar anxiety? How did you manage it? Mostly I need help with roleplaying because that seems to be the bit that gets me most of all. Also I'm the bard sooooo any tips for that would be great (yup- the irony of the bard being really fcking quiet most games and being anxious about speaking is not lost on me)",11,1585506675,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/framyp/how_do_you_get_over_anxiety_roleplaying/,DnD,1

fra83a,Carrelio,Camp Fire Session,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

Our party, which has traditionally been an in person group has recently transitioned to digital due to the quarantine. The change can make the roleplaying aspect much harder and make things feel a little awkward. So I figured... let's double down on it for next session and make things even more awkward! At the end of the last session I proposed we do an in person campfire session for all of our characters to get to know each other better.

&amp;#x200B;

I am no stranger to... well... pretty much any aspects of roleplaying... and I know that in character camp fire sessions can be tough since you have to break through people's discomfort and shyness first. With that in mind, I figured I would give the DM some help in both finding some resources for jump-starting conversations, as well as looking for some things that I can do as one of the players to get people talking and into it.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any easy conversation starters, topics, tips, etc. that you would suggest for getting the ball rolling and keeping it rolling?",4,1585505215,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fra83a/camp_fire_session/,DnD,3

I was fighting a water elemental, and while my campaign buddy backed away because I had to attack him or the elemental, I rolled a natural 20 and sliced the elemental in half, killing it instantly. As I ran towards my buddy, he cast entangle. Although it didn't affect me, the ground became difficult terrain. I couldn't reach him, so I threw my scimitar. The scimitar got lodged in his leg, and he was on deaths door. When it cam to be his turn, he took the scimitar out of his leg and swung at me. I knew that I would be able to kill him the next turn, and our DM said ""There's no way he's going to win.""

I'm ordering my players some Nolzur minis to represent their characters, but in order to keep the theme going I am really keen to buy some impressive minis for my endgame boss battles.

Nolzur minis are **28mm base** for medium creatures. Below are the BBEGs i am using and their sizes according to D&amp;D 3.5e. Please recommend some potential minis I could use for them! :) 

I'm interested in anything - official minis, deluxe minis, create-your-own. Doesn't have to be D&amp;D related either, as long as it would look the part. Even paper minis would be pretty cool I think.

**ALSO** \- If there are some super cool undead you think I should throw at my PCs please give me some thoughts - please and thank you! 

**Corpse Gatherer** \- *Gargantuan* Undead 

Basically a massive undead made up of the corpses of lots of smaller undead things.

[https://www.realmshelps.net/monsters/block/Corpse\_Gatherer](https://www.realmshelps.net/monsters/block/Corpse_Gatherer)

**Nightcrawler** \- *Gargantuan* Undead

This one might be easier because it's pretty much a Purple Worm type creature. 

[https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Nightcrawler](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Nightcrawler)

**Balor** \- *Large* Outsider (But I would prefer to go for Huge as this is the final boss)

I haven‚Äôt really thought about how they see gender or sexual orientation, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be important for this character) level progression.

Avrae blessed me (stats are generated on the server by the Avrae bot or using 27 point buy), so I‚Äôll be starting with Str 11, Dex 18, Con 16, Int 18, Wis 13, and Cha 12.

At each ASI, here‚Äôs what I was thinking: level 4, War Caster; level 8, Resilient: Con; level 12, Int 20; level 16 Alert (maybe); level 20, I have no clue what to grab.

I‚Äôm not sure if I should pick up Alert because I‚Äôll have +8 to my initiative rolls from levels 2-11, and +9 after level 12. I don‚Äôt want to go overkill when I could be taking something else that will help me out (like Lucky, perhaps?), but maybe having +14 to my initiative rolls is important because my character will want to start with a battlefield control or buff/debuff spell? I‚Äôve never actually played a Wizard, so this is my first time.

At level 20, I‚Äôm just not sure what to pick up at all. Should I take Lucky? Buff my Dex to 20 or Con to 19? Take Tough to make sure I can take a couple extra hits, just to be safe? Maybe Durable to take my Con to 18, which is like getting half of the power of Tough, and better my short rest healing? Maybe Spell Sniper is good, but I also have heard it‚Äôs a trap feat for most caster builds, so I have no idea about it?

Cloth Friend

A docile mimic made of cloth which will bond itself to the next character that touches it after its old master abandons it. While the Cloth Friend is allowed to crawl into your backpack, it will constantly peek outside of it, looking for projectiles. If the user is hit by a ranged attack, the Cloth Friend will turn itself into a hand which adds +2AC to the owner's if applicable to the attack, potentially negating it. If it is an arrow, the cloth friend will deposit it into the owner's inventory. The Cloth Friend can catch projectiles up to 1d3 times a day. The Cloth Friend will also protect any of its owner‚Äôs allies within 5ft.

It is also very jealous and will throw out any other toys that get placed into the owner's backpack.",3,1585502929,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr9klv/cloth_friend_mimic/,DnD,2

Tabletop tokens look really good, as do the dungeon craft by 1985 games but there almost seems to be too much choice that it's quite overwhelming on where to begin.

fr8x2j,LukeMonteiro,[SPOILERS] Just finished my first campaign as a DM (LMOP) and wanted to thank you all,"Hey guys, I'm just writing this post because I finally finished my first DnD campaign as a DM. I took all your advice to heart (also shoutout to r/dndnext, you guys are great) and made some tweaks here and there, as we played the adventure. Therefore, SPOILER WARNING:

First things first, I made the Doppelganger a lot more important than the module intended. My PCs only found out it was him at the end when they saw Tharden's dead body in Wave Echo Cave. Other people my Doppelganger impersonated:

* He was one of the Goblins that survived Cragmaw Hideout
* He was also Sister Garaele (who is still missing)
* Droop (the goblin in the Redbrand hideout)
* Reidoth (The druid in Thundertree, who just wasn't visiting the ruins that day)
* He impersonated the Black Spider himself when my PCs visited Cragmaw Castle
* And finally, for the best one, the Doppelganger impersonated Tharden Rockseeker, leading the party to the Wave Echo Cave and revealing himself there.

My player's mind was blown off since it was their first time playing DnD and they didn't expect a Doppelganger to be the one giving quests to them and being there all that time.

I also incorporated Cryovain in the module, but that was the only thing I took from DOIP. I put him in Old Owl Well, fighting against the Necromancer (Harmun Kost). Kost is in the Netheril Ruins looking for the Nether Scrolls and helps the party kill Cryovain. I had Cryovain set up since day one with little notes about cold winds and icicles where there should be none. One of my players is a Half-Dragon Paladin, so he knew something was up. The dragon killed all the zombies with his breath weapon as soon as the players got to the Well and the Necromancer helped them.

After the fight is over, Harmun Kost decides to keep the dragon corpse to use as a substitute for his twelve zombies. The Paladin only allowed it because he promised not to harm Phandalin. Kost keeps looking for the Scrolls, but finds something a bit darker (the Phylactery of Arthindol, the one who created the where Old Owl Well is located) and plans to make a ritual to combine the Lich soul and the dragon body, weakening the Lich's power and getting hold of a Dracolich.

Finally, expanded on some of the characters in Phandalin, like Nilsa (Thel Dendrar's daughter), the Mayor and Sildar himself. I'll start with Sildar.

Sildar was a Gryphon rider in his youth, but after she died he started adventuring for money and for the Lord's Alliance. He met both the Rockseeker brothers and Iarno when they were young, and the three formed started a friendship. They would meet from time to time, Gundren always telling them both about his expeditions (the Rockseeker brothers are a band of Archeologists/explorers like Indiana Jones). Iarno grew distant because he was always studying and trying to find new ways to gather money. This made the betrayal of Iarno weigh a lot more on Sildar's shoulders. 

Nilsa saw her father get murdered by the hands of the redbrands and it sparked her hatred against evildoers. Sildar is training her in the art of the blade as a way to try to calm her down. The players managed to get sildar a +1 Greatsword so he could protect the citizens of Phandalin, but Nilsa will be the one to use it, actually (I planted the seed for her to either become an Oath of Vengeance Paladin or a Pact of the Hexblade Warlock). 

The Mayor was a douche to the PCs all the time and told everyone, after they beat the Redbrands, that he was the one to send them after the evildoers. As soon as they clean Tresendar Manor, the mayor runs towards it, looking for whatever is calling him in the Nothic's lair. He has dreams of it, calling him. The Mayor grants the players the Manor, as a way to keep his research about the occult. It kinda fails, though because Sildar is the one taking care of the manor while the players are traveling. I'm also using the Strongholds and Followers supplement for this part. In the end, it is the Hand and Eye of Vecna that were calling for the Mayor.

Finally, Wave Echo Cave. I changed the Forge of Spells location to behind the Dwarven statue where the players face Nezznar. I'll get to Nezznar first. He is still a Male Drow 4th level spellcasters, but he is also a Rebel who tried to take over the underdark and was punished by his goddess Lolth. She turned him into a Drider (spellcaster Drider) but he managed to create a device that would cloak his horrendous nature, turning him into a normal drow. The drawback was that if the Necklace was destroyed, he would turn back to a Drider. It reacted every time Nezznar used a spell or his HP got lower. When Nezznar drops to 0, he doesn't die but is instead turned back into his Drider form. He rages against the players and attacks even more furiously.

For this to work properly, I scaled back the number of encounters in the Cave because there was A LOT of only time consuming not fun encounters. I made the flame Skull the Spectator's master and used foreshadowing for the final encounter in the cave, the Spectator. Players managed to trick him, which is really nice since it was just a silly thing to murder him without reason. Nezznar only has two Giant Spiders with him, so if you get to make your spellcaster use the Lightning bold Scroll and shot them both+Nezznar, transforming him back into a Drider, it will be a REALLY sweet reveal. My Sorcerer did it, my GF's mind was blown when she realized what she had done.

My players also revived Tharden, after the fight was over because there is also a Scroll for it in the campaign and Nezznar killed him in a week, so my paladin thought it was fitting to bring him back. 

Again, thanks to all of you for all you taught to me, really. I will be eternally grateful for it, as I am now a much better DM than I was before reading your tips.

fr8r0v,GoldeneyeGamer,"People who have gotten 3 nat 20's in a row, what happened?","So I'm playing an Oracle type of character in an evil campaign, where a good amount of RP is involved. Our party's strength guy Chad (yes, he is the perfect embodiment of Chad) started discovering an innate psychic ability. This helped us make contact with a group of psychics on the other side of an impenetrable tower we need to get inside, who told him to open his mind before returning. Since he's a Chad, he didn't quite get it at first, and I had to explain levitating to him like it was repping weights up and down, but with himself (dude's so strong he can lift himself). So to help him open his mind, I taught him how to meditate.   


Things went decent the first try, but he wasn't really getting it so he came up with the brilliant idea of Levitating in the open air to meditate. The first time we try it, he gets smacked with a bird on a nat 1 while i get a natural 20. Pretty cool, but nothing's going to immediately come from this. Later that session a few days down the line, Chad wants to try again with my help. We float up into the air, and I roll... another natural 20. At this point the GM says he'll message me something after the session, which was (spoilers to my group, you know who you are, skip to next paragraph) two separate prophecies telling me a bit of what's to come and major happenings in the world. One of them involved a seer, but since it was an evil campaign of pathfinder I took the spell Obscure Object and ordered a solid box so we can hold meetings to arrive at the end of that week.

Next session comes, and towards the end of the session and a day or two before the box arrives, Chad wants to try meditating again. Of course, I go with him, and this time i specifically said ""GM, do you have something prepared in case I get another nat 20?"", to which he said yes. He was not prepared. With that third natural 20 I kind of just ascended, to the point that I had a halo glowing around me I was so into it. I'm still waiting to hear from GM about what's coming from this, but it's going to be something special. I don't want to jinx it, but the fourth hasn't been rolled yet, so there may be more to come.",7,1585500034,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr8r0v/people_who_have_gotten_3_nat_20s_in_a_row_what/,DnD,2

fr72m8,DrunkenMagister,DMing Fatigue,"Hi everyone, I hope you are well in this challenging times.

I'd like your advice as on how to manage numerous groups of players, without sacrificing their fun and engagement. 

As a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak my group moved its sessions on-line, it's not so bad but I still prefer meeting up. Anyway, word spread and my previously 4-players-party has reached 15 members. I tried splitting them in smaller groups, maybe mixing novices with more experienced players. As a result we ended up with three 5-players-parties. 

It has now been two weeks since we begun, for a total of 12 sessions. During this time a dear friend of mine volunteered to help with the campaign building and I don't think I could have done it without her. But I don't want this to become too much of a weight for either of us.

So I have come to the place that always soothes my sorrows in search for suggestions.

fr657e,snikler,Inquisitive rogues are way better than I expected,"Multiple posts here and in other forums mention how underwhelming inquisitive rogue skills are. I decided to try it only because of RP and utility, but I was very positively surprised after two game sessions (Lv 4) about how much it  adds to combat tactics. 
The chief skill insightful fighting was wonderful in both days. Being able to freely decide who is going to be the target of sneak attack was often tactically precious. 
With bonus action overall free, I could use cunning action for disengage multiple times. But often I saw myself taunting enemies to alleviate pressure on other melee combatants. As I dual wield, I could choose between an additional attack or eye for detail. And one needs only once eye for detail and can be game changing. If DM is good, and we are lucky to have a good one, he/she can use these opportunities to turn a combat in something very entertaining. 
Finally, taking prisoners for interrogation is something that was all in my hands because ear for deceit gives me the confidence that I can trust the info given. 
Overall, from RP to combat, I felt very useful by filling a lot of gaps in the party (warrior, sorcerer,  cleric, monk, and bard), and the PC shone in utility, dps, and RP.
I highly recommend.

Any official content is allowed, as well as any UA content, and most homebrew ideas which are just a minor change (for example, a homebrew Tiefling who had an ancestry such that they gain cold resistance instead of fire resistance, or an Artificer who gains the ability to make a magic item not from the regular tables but of similar rarity/ability).

Can anybody help me with finding a few spells based around psychological manipulation and torment (like Dissonant Whispers, Vicious Mockery, later Mind Spike), and then a few spells that give off the same vibes as his destructive showcase (spells similar in flavour to Evard's Black Tentacles).

I'd also appreciate if people could give tips on other spells that would fit the theme of a creepily cheerful Bard that has a dark, twisted, sadistic side and likes to psychologically torment his enemies as well as use his raw, unbridled power to crush them.

fr4n3u,Helarki,The Molotov Monk Build,"I'm not the greatest at builds but I wanted to share something fun I came up with. Ever get tired of just punching things in the face? Don't you wish you could blow stuff up like the wizard? With the Molotov Monk, you can.  


So pretty much, mostly be a monk for this build. There's one specific feat you need and a monk subclass, and then you can do whatever you want. The core idea of this build can be achieved at level 3 (assuming you use variant human).  


For your feat, choose Tavern Brawler - that way you aren't handicapped by darkvision and can shove a torch into an enemy's face when they come at you. Probably add the CON modifier, unless you want to get a better grapple in.  


For your subclass, choose the Drunken Master. You have proficiency in brewer's supplies so you can get that still started up. But you don't wanna drink that stuff. This is where the Molotov Monk comes from. During downtime, make as many alcohol bottles as you can with cloth strips stuffed in. In battle, light them on fire and throw them (they're improvised so you should be able to have proficiency).  


Granted, this does not help in fighting a lot of later-level monsters because fire damage is one of the most-resisted against types. However, you could always take the Skilled Feat and gain proficiency in Alchemist's Supplies. Make Acid Molotovs to chuck at the Tarrasque (if they explode on impact, they can't be reflected). Likewise, you could take a few levels in Cleric to make holy water, so you can finish the undeads' whole career. Variety is key. Come up with all kinds of different Molotov variants and then yeet them at your enemies.  


However, I suggest you contact your DM about this because improvised weapons are wielded at the DM's discretion. I know that as a DM, I would panic if this issue came into play without my knowledge.

fr3obo,Ovidiu_J,Need tips/advice on handling potentially overloading players with new skills/abilities,"My players just joined an extremely powerful/resourceful secret organization. Due to RP reasons, the org is extremely rich and very selective with who they take in. New members need to be selected by an active member and pass complex trials. 

Once in, it makes sense for the player power-level to increase drastically, due to access to the org's resources. The org doesn't use money internally, you gain access to perks based on your rank. 

""Level 1"" inside the org grants them access to the basic stuff from every artisan/trainer. This would include: 

1. Slightly better weapons than what they already have
2. A single rune tattooed on their body (more on this down the post) 
3. A training program 
4. Two potions each 
5. A ring of the Knighthood 

**Runes:** Made a homebrew system where runes can be tattooed on a PC and they are extremely powerful, character-altering elements. But due to their power, the body can only handle a single rune at once, at least until they become strong enough to handle more. You can see them here [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kED8qfOwxatwjocGsyJ8VxxWLJl1WeGm60-5Ts7O66I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kED8qfOwxatwjocGsyJ8VxxWLJl1WeGm60-5Ts7O66I/edit?usp=sharing) 

**Training program** (they need to pick a single training path, but it's fairly straightforward melee/magic / ranged - haven't made the ranged one yet) [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFJTUqIjnm1LJ-PuJyU1caAaBcXLp4xqZZWQT2odyWA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fFJTUqIjnm1LJ-PuJyU1caAaBcXLp4xqZZWQT2odyWA/edit?usp=sharing)

**Ring of the Knighthood** ***‚Äî*** Haven't decided on what it does yet. I know it will be a way to keep track of their rank. As they become more aligned with the values of the order, more details of the Organization's insignia appear on the ring. Probably not too strong though, my current idea is advantage on CHA checks against lawful NPCs. 

I know some of these things will seem OP, but I don't mind it. It's a two-player party so I don't mind making them a bit stronger, plus I can always tweak the mobs if the encounters seem too easy.  

I also think they will add a new dimension to the game ‚Äî¬†I think choosing a rune will be a really tough choice because they are all useful/OP in their own way and could meaningfully impact the flow of encounters. And the training path will make them keep track of how often they use the skills and bring a new layer to progression, hopefully making them feel like they are actually slowly mastering a new skill that's foreign to their class. 

I'm fine giving them all of this, and it makes sense from an RP perspective. But I don't want them to get overwhelmed. 

Do you have any tips on how to handle this, without blocking out things as only for higher-level members?",6,1585476562,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr3obo/need_tipsadvice_on_handling_potentially/,DnD,1

fr2z92,MW_147,I TPKed my party,"So this is my first time DMing a group (and my second DnD game overall) and I've been trying not to TPK the group as a result of the choices they've been making (namely running into rooms and getting into encounters without healing from the previous encounter first). But last night there was no way I was going to be able to spread the damage across the party so they all survived (not that any of them did anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running the Curse of Strahd module and we've been going through the optional Death House quest and the characters are currently level 2. It's taken the group 7 sessions to find their way down the the underground ritual room, partly cause our sessions only run for about 2 hours max and partly cause they sometimes get caught up on insignificant details (when I say the books are written in a language none of you can read, the logical choice would be to just move on with the story, not sit there for the next 20 minutes trying to see if you can discover anything from said books...).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the previous session they just managed to get through an encounter with a pair of ghasts by the skin of their teeth (everyone in the party was rolling death saves at one point or another during the encounter). After this, they did some more exploring and eventually found themselves on the bottom level of the dungeon. They decided to stop and heal what they could. The most hit points that any one of them had was probably 14 or 15 (the two I remember was tiefling druid at 10/12 and human barbarian at 13/26).

&amp;#x200B;

So they reached the ritual room and climb the dais where they need to perform a specific action if they didn't want things to go south for them. And they just walked away. Without performing the action. Which then awakened the challenge rating 5 shambling mound with it's 142 health and it's +7 to hit slam attack that could hit twice in one round. Here's how that encounter worked out:

Round 1: half-orc monk gets insta killed (both attacks hit, one was a crit), no chance for death rolls

Round 2: human bard also gets insta killed, no chance for death rolls

Round 3: human barbarian was knocked unconscious

Round 4: half-orc paladin was knocked unconscious

Round 5: tiefling druid was knocked unconscious

Round 6: nothing

Round 7: gnome ranger was knocked unconscious, barbarian dies

Round 8: paladin stabilises

Round 9: paladin gets killed, tiefling stabilises

Round 10: tiefling gets killed, no chance for death rolls

&amp;#x200B;

And that's where we decided to end the session. With everyone dead (yes, technically gnome was still unconscious, but that was as good as dead in this scenario). They did manage to knock a good 63 health off the shambling mound, but it was all in vain.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the party wants to run some sort of 'escaping the underworld' side mission so their characters can come back to the land of the living and they can continue using them rather than rolling up new characters.",6,1585472429,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr2z92/i_tpked_my_party/,DnD,1

fr2dnp,asabassa1,First Deaths (Plural) as a first time DM,"Characters got in way over their heads by keeping their head in the sand. No meaninful insight, questions asked, or investigation during an entire quest. NPC said ""Do X"" and they blindly said sure. 

Fast forward to the end. The players arrive back at where this NPC after seeing an army of her minions. NPC reveals herself as hidden baddie and says, look I'm way more powerful than you, but you did me a solid, so I'm going to reward you. Make a *choice*. You can save this dying child of a local lord OR save whomever I haven't yet killed inside that building OR try to kill me. They choose pretty much all the above and attack everything they can at once. 

1 of 4 is Banished. 
2 of 4 are making Death Saves. 
1 is doing okay.

Battle essentially pauses and baddie and her minions Spare the Dying on the two whom are down. She demands a *choice* be made by the last standing (on *this* plane) player of whom to save. You can save any one of your party members or the boy or whomever I haven't killed inside, BUT I get to keep the reason. You'll know who you choose to save and die but not why. 

Player attacks the baddie and her minions who then kill him and the other party members who they had just spared. With one or two rounds left on Banishment the final party member comes back into play to see everyone dead. Baddie looks right at him and says ""A choice has been made."" and  she and her minions leave. The final party is member alive (also he had 2 HP).

After the session I gave the player the choice to retire the character and role new with everyone else or keep going. I look forward to next session!

fr21k3,TalynGray,Area affects for a magical artifact,"I have 3 items I am wanting to get the party to collect, each with a ""time"" theme. I'd like each to be having an effect on the environment, people nearby.

The first is shaped like the flux capacitor from Back to the future. It is the symbol for a monastery of monks who have all gone mad/feral for some reason.

The other two are a time turner/pocket watch (harry potter) and a blue box (doctor who) - unless someone has better suggestions.

The two locations for those items is 'the boneyard' a crypt of sorts where a demon is trying to access one item for some reason?And a pirate cove/township where the localised affect has a pirate lord (and his cohorts near him?) have been using the power of the item to maintain power.
Only the locations ""boneyard and demon"" and ""town and pirate lord"" are locked in with maps. 

Would love some ideas to finish these off.

Thanks in advance.

fr20xt,I_dont-get_the-joke,Would it be fair to let a player play a dragon after a certain level?,"Waaay back, like 5 years ago or so, I was super into dragons in rpg's. I had just made a dragon commander deck in MTG and My buddy was hosting a Homebrew Pathfinder game. He invited me to play, so I was playing a guy who worshipped dragons. He had a breath weapon, wings, and a bunch of other characteristics. Eventually, around level 12 or so, the DM pulled me to the side and said ""Hey bud, do you just want to play a dragon? I can let you be a hatchling if you want.''

Unfortunately I wasn't able to take him up on his offer as the group devolved slowly soon after, but I would have loved to have done it. Since then, I've become a forever DM to a group of players for 5e and I've found a guy who had the same passion I had for dragonkind. 

I understand Pathfinder has creature type templates that you can put on characters that sacrifice levels for cool stuff.and creature types, but is this something I could do for a player? Hatchlings are CR 3, if we hit level 13 or 14, could I just let him take over a dragon wyrmling?",20,1585466823,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr20xt/would_it_be_fair_to_let_a_player_play_a_dragon/,DnD,1

fr1zn3,Alicerasus,I sorta rewrote the spell system? Looking for feedback!,"I kinda rewrote the spell system? I am looking for feedback! I posted this in r/DungeonsAndDragons as well, but this sub is way bigger and I‚Äôm hoping to reach more people. 

So, for my campaign, I thought it would be more interesting for my players if they got to theme their characters around an element more than a class. But I realized the normal system doesn‚Äôt lend itself to that super easily, so I kinda rewrote the whole thing. Balancing is key though, and I was wondering if any of you had any ideas about it (players and DMs!) This is a bit of a read, so bear with me please! 

As an introduction, each character is naturally attuned to one of the major four elements (fire, water, wind, and air) as well as one of the ‚Äúancient‚Äù elements (light and dark). They are locked out of using spells from the opposite element (fire to water, air to earth, light to dark). The element they are attuned to gets the proficiency bonus, while non attuned ones do not. I have also divided all the PHB spells into elemental lists if anyone wants that! 

Instead of class-based spell lists, I created the system of Shards (name pending); magic catalysts that contain the essence of spells. Each shard can be used once per long rest, except for certain more powerful spells (revive spells and things that usually have a major material cost) which either break on use or are dormant for longer. Cantrip shards are infinite use just like normal. 

Unlike spell slots, you can only cast the spell as long as you have a Shard for it. You cannot expend Shards for different spells to cast a certain spell multiple times. 

If you want to use a spell at a higher level (let‚Äôs say Scorching Ray), you can destroy a Shard of equal level to the spell‚Äôs current level to increase the spell‚Äôs potency/level. For example, I can choose to destroy my Gentle Repose Shard to level up my Scorching Ray Shard to a level 3. 

There is no level requirement to using Shards, so if a level 3 character somehow gets their hands on a Sunburst shard, you bet your butt they can cast it (as long as they can cast fire magic). 

THERE IS NO LIMIT on how many of a Shard you can have! If you get a hold of 14 Fireballs then by Merlin‚Äôs beard you can cast Fireball 14 times! 

Shards can be traded, bartered, bough, and sold and are an integral part of my world‚Äôs economy! I just don‚Äôt really know the conversion rate of Shards to GP yet üòÖ

I think that‚Äôs everything! I know that was really long, but if anyone has thoughts or feedback, or wants to know more please let me know!

And thanks to a very talented artist I was able to make him come to life. Bunbundango, on Tumbler, a very talented and very patient artist who worked with me to make sure I loved every bit of it. Thank you so much for all the hard work you put into him! He goes by many names. Talroc, Smith, Barr, and Viktor are the most common. Some more... choice names would be The Golem, GateKeeper, and IronForged. Though those names are more whispered than said, and by only those who know of the true events that happened. Originally left abandoned at the foot of a artificers shop as a baby. Taken in out of pity, he was raised by the Master Artificers in the shop. Taught to be compassionate about his work, firm but carful with his hands, and to take zero shit from anyone. Especially when it came to someone who didn't know what they were talking about. He spent many years learning rune craft, smithing, alchemy, and magic at the hands of the Masters of the shop. He went on to hold apprenticeships with ArchMages and Master Smith to perfect his craft. In his journey to find and hone his skills, he took up necessary skills to ensure that he was not only the top of his craft, but to ensure his survival. He even sacrificed his arm to get to where he is today, at least in a fashion he did. He worked in an official capacity as the Royal Tinkerer and a Volstrucker Agent. Although some paths are more darker than others and he wish not remember them. Where ever he goes, he is welcome to stay at any forge if their masters have any clue to who he is.

I love Kenku conceptually, their mimicry is a seriously cool trait which allows for some super creative and fun roleplay moments, and their forgery is a fun little addition which, while it might never seriously play into a game, is still cool to have.

  
But my god they're genuinely underpowered.

  
I legitimately can't think of a single other race in 5e that gets \*\*nothing\*\* to aid it or affect it in combat, or in moment to moment gameplay.  Kenku don't get darkvision, they don't get any kind of natural weapons from their talons or beaks, they don't get any sort of speed boost from their hollow bones and light builds, they get \*\*nothing,\*\* in combat it's almost like having no race at all, there is absolutely nothing unique going on mechanically.

I really want to play a Kenku barbarian who, during combat, replays the screams of agony and cries for mercy of his former enemies to intimidate his foes. I can imagine this huge, jacked, mute crow person with scaled avian arms and intimidating claws, but I'm turned off from playing this character, because the stats of a Kenku cross the line from being just unorthodox or fun flaws, to being a straight-up total liability to the effectiveness of your character.",14,1585464586,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr1lqm/kenku_are_underpowered/,DnD,1

fr1ahs,Adoom98,"For any DMs that are aprehensive about moving their game online, here are my (mostly positive) results from my first online game on Roll20","Hey guys! I just had a conversation with another DM about this and thought it would be worth sharing. 

I just DM'd my first online game on Roll20 (with audio through discord) yesterday after playing in person for over 3 years. 

It has pros and cons but i liked it way more than i expected, here's why:

- You can basically have any maps/terrains/minis/npcs that you can find online in the game in minutes

- It's very easy to keep track of health and conditions

- you can create character health bars

- There's really useful tools for fog of war, line of sight and measuring distance

- labelling enemies is easy and makes it easier to keep track of multiple creatures

- people are forced to talk one at a time (which may not be an issue for a smaller group)

- you spend much less time setting up and packing away, almost none

- you can prepare multiple locations for one game 

- rolling large amounts of dice is quicker and is calculated for you

Some cons are that you miss out on body language and facial expressions to communicate. It can be slow for people to learn a new system. Sometimes we had issues with connection and communication and honestly yeah it just loses some charm not literally being with your friends.

That being said, i enjoyed it way more than i expected thanks to all the surprising positives and it genuinely isn't thst difficult to set up and learn if you watch a couple tutorials.

Anyway, i just thought it would help to share this knowledge as i know it would've helped my enthusiasm if I'd have known prior!

fr170c,JakeEkiss,How to Run a Party of Mixed (Good/Evil) Characters,"So, before I get any further into this, [I highly recommend this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVuF4fkRD2c), as it covers most of the ground I will, along with a whole sub-section about playing evil vs being evil. It's good, so check it out.

Anyway, here's the thing, the way you run a party of mixed good/evil characters relies on one, simple, but rarely articulated question about D&amp;D, ***what is a party?***

And the answer to that is equally simple, but it betrays a step of making a group that many DMs and players (especially new DMs and players) skip. So here it is:

***A party is a group with either a shared goal, or an aggregation of complimentary goals that they cannot individually achieve alone.***

Some folks out there have already spotted the step people skip when building a game. You have to have those goals, and they have to be bigger than any single member of the party. They don't need to be ""defeat the BBEG or the world will end"" (though that will work in a pinch, and the DM can introduce it largely without the players needing to do anything). 

No, they just need to be bigger than Sven the fighter can resolve on his own. Bigger than Argus the mage can solve on her own. They just need to be something that each character in the group wants to do, but can't do without help. And they don't have to be the same goal. One character wants to build an army and topple the Traitor King, another wants to find the lost tome of Balathazul hidden in the Mines of Madness. These are separate goals that have nothing in common (and, I should point out, either could be a good or evil goal)... except that a level one character can't do either of them without help. 

This is the flaw that makes people think the ""you meet in a tavern"" intro to a game is busted. The intro is fine \*if\* the players are already thinking about ways they can work together. Note there I said the ***players*** are thinking about it, not the characters. The characters are tools the players use to build a shared narrative with the DM. That means that Sven the fighter could be a rugged-loner-who-works-alone-and-likes-the-loneliness-of-being-lonely... but when he sees the upstart mage Argus, he thinks ""Ugh, I hate her... too chipper... bet she talks too much... but a fireball would be handy in a scrap..."". That's a narrative decision made by Sven's player, but it is also a character choice that matches Sven's goals. 

And that's the key. The characters don't need to want to work together; they don't even need to like each other. ***But the players do***. The players and DM are doing the work here of making the party fit together out of game, so that the in-game portions work.

Yeah, this means you cannot play literally any character with any motivation and have it work. But that has always been the case. A psychopathic maniac who compulsively murders the closest warm body the instant they get the chance would be hard pressed to work in any party. So would the ultra-authoritarian, ""I must arrest that man for jaywalking!"" knight. Most often you'll see these colloquialized online as *lawful and chaotic stupid*. And they are, not because those characters would never exist in any fantasy world, but because those characters would almost never work in a group, any group. They generally only work if they are the main character of a narrative, and ***D&amp;D is an ensemble game.*** 

Some folks will say ""but a necromancer and a life cleric could NEVER work together"". Well, it's already been done, by many DMs and players, over 40 years of D&amp;D gaming. Somehow they figured it out. And yeah, it won't happen if the players and DM aren't putting in any effort, if they aren't helping to establish that baseline. You can't make it work with a free-for-all party who does not care about this foundational assumption. That's true. 

But then, that's often true of non-mixed groups, and some folks seem to miss the common breaking point.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Oh, and a quick note, included in those goals that cannot be achieved alone are explicitly antagonistic goals. Say Argus and Sven meet Helgan the bard in their travels. Maybe that bard says he's just along for the ride to get some good stories for his trade (a perfectly legit reason, and maybe even partially true). But maybe that bard is also a spy for the Traitor King, and maybe his job is to shadow these two adventurers, help them identify the king's worst enemies, and grab the tome of Balathazul, and then, at the last possible moment, turn on his erstwhile companions. The final session, when all the party's plans are about to come to fruition, and their worst enemy, the last NPC to fight (aside fromt he Traitor King himself) is their very own ""friend"" Helgan.

fr0zjj,Aspynisnotatree,My ranger is actually a rogue,"I'm in a party of five, in which I originally had a character, but my first DM left, and I agreed to take his place. Thus, I had to figure out a way to transition out my own character. She was a bard who was notorious in her home town for sleeping around and having a bunch of boyfriends. Because bards. So, in order to pull her away from her adventuring suddenly, I set up a story of one of her ex-lovers, a high elf with a lot of political influence, who obsessed about her and eventually blackmailed her into going to their home and marrying him. It was meant to just be a not-so-happy ending for the character, but as soon as the party found this out, they made it their mission to ignore the dragon that needed slaying and run off to save her. The important character here is the Ranger, an elf named Faera. She was known for being very blunt and often blatantly rude. My party as a whole is a force of chaos, and they never seem to do things in a way that would actually make sense. 

So instead of perhaps talking it out with this guy or killing him, they choose to fake the bard's death. I had no plan for that, so I had to make things up on the spot. They made a plan to deceive the ex-lover by making it look like she had hung herself. With some high deception and dexterity rolls, they actually managed to pull this off, and the bard was taken to a morgue to wait for them to come to rescue her. On their way through the halls, they run across a guard going about his rounds. Two of the three that were there to rescue the bard made successful stealth checks. The ranger did not. The guard tries to place her under arrest. She rolls low on a strength check and is unable to get away from him. She tells me. ""I moan, hopefully putting him off guard, pressing hard against him enough to be more painful than pleasurable"". Disbelieving, I make her roll a performance check. Nat 20. I made her roll a stealth check to get away. Nat 20. 

Absolutely nothing about the whole experience went as planned. The actual side quest is a whole other story.

fr0k87,Ranchstaff24,An Empty Dungeon,"Just an idea that I've been playing around with, and I'm wondering if anyone has every attempted it before. Would it be fun or just anticlimactic to have an entirely empty dungeon in my homebrew campaign? Now, I'm talking entirely empty of threats. Not a single trap, not a single monster. And at the end, a pile of treasure. Free for the taking. It's just never been touched because the locals are too afraid to venture inside, because everyone knows dungeons are full of traps and monsters. 

I don't even need an immediate plan, but I feel like it could open up opportunities for interesting stories down the road. Maybe it's cursed, maybe it holds religious importance, maybe it belongs to a monster that was just gone at the time the players stumbled in. Or maybe there's nothing at all and the players are left wondering for the rest of the campaign, always on edge about the mysterious unguarded treasure.",9,1585459449,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fr0k87/an_empty_dungeon/,DnD,1
fr0jz6,Kthulhu40k,"Ia Ia! I need help with making The ""Mr. Bookman"" of Faerun; A Twilight Zone character on the Sword Coast","Hello fellow adventurers, I seek some aid. Rod Serling has yet again struck me for wanting to make a character based on one of his own( that, and boredom from quatantine). In this case, it's Lou Bookman.

 For those of you who are not acquainted; the plot follows Lou, a sixty year old pitchman and toy maker who goes about his day until greeted by Death himself. Death tells Lou that he is going to pass away in his sleep at midnight. In fear of passing, Lou manages to convince Death to give him an extension so that he may deliver ""a pitch for the angels"". However, Death must take someone, and causes a car to hit a little girl named Maggie so that she may replace Lou. Clever as he is, Lou manages to make Death miss his appointment by delivering his angelic pitch. Impressed, Death to leave Maggie and instead take a more humble and content Lou. 

Now the question remains; how could Mr. Bookman be made into a dnd character? His backround and stats are pretty obvious. He could well be an honest charlatan with high charisma and lower constitution. Not really a fighting type, but morseo a party face. Alignment could be lawful good or nuetral, and skills dipping more into persuasion and deception. Alas, the hard part. What class should he be? Several come to mind, mainly artificer. Seeing that he has a knack for toys, he may use his artifice in toys and other general goods. But perhaps he could be a cleric, given his divine experience. Perhaps he works for a god of Death since his meeting with its agent. This is where I ask for help, oh adventurers. Any suggestions or insights would be of great help.

We're 12 in total. This isn't the kind of campaign to end after beating the BBEG, but more to just make a bunch of new evil to defeat, and if we get at final level, we'll start a new campaign in the same world.

We currently have three important bad guys

1. The Red Elf / Red Wizard. Being in the campaign for longer than I've been playing. An elven wizard always dressed in red robes, and being incredibly powerful. He once paralyzed the entire party without them being able to have a saving throw, because his modifiers were bigger than their stats. No one really knows his intentions, because he's apparently chasing us, but never killed us when he has the chance.
2. Alexander the Unstoppable. A vampire that is literally standing out in sunlight, bare-chest, burning in smoke, but doesn't care because it doesn't hurt him and he's regenerating faster than he is burning. He's twice as muscular as our barbarian, whom has 18 strength, and when he asked the barbarian to hit him, the DM described it as ""hitting a brick wall"". Alex then just went away, disappointed, and said ""I'll be back when you're a challenge to me."".
3. The Dark Lady. Kina, daughter of the goddess of life and the god of death, was one of the many gods and goddesses of war. Because of her natural conflict with herself, she was sometimes as kind as her mother, sometimes more cruel than her father. Before the Blood War began, and the demons were facing the gods and not the devils, Kina had to abandon her light part, and let her darkness and rage take over. She ate thousands of millions of demons. She was even more corrupt and dark after this, and had to be sealed away. What I just described is the mother of the Dark Lady, whom one of the party members released ""by accident"" because he thought that it was a good idea to remove a holy spear form the ribcage of a draugr in a temple guarded by angels... but it was not",2,1585455010,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqzknh/why_should_we_have_only_one_boss_when_theyre_so/,DnD,1

fqz9oh,TheAmethystDragon,"There is a need for DMs, and everyone is a beginner at some point.","Hello, all.

I DM a weekly game that had to move online because of the COVID-19 mess. Until this week, I'd never actually run an online session before. It was surprisingly easy with my lower-level group, and I think it will stay that way as they rise in level and I get more experienced with using Roll20 (we use Discord for voice chatting).

I was going to try to find a different game on there that I could join as a player, but then considered a few things:

1. There are always people that have never played before asking about starting right here in r/DnD.
2. There are always people looking to get into the game over in r/lfg.
3. Player spots for games on Roll20's LFG list fill up fast.

So, being a helpful guy, I decided to just DM a brand new game for 5 others to join. Instead of simply taking the first 5 responders, I decided to leave the player application time open until the 31st. I posted the game about 48 hours ago...and already have over 100 people that want to play.

I am here now to seriously encourage anyone with any interest in running D&amp;D, or experience playing D&amp;D, to consider starting their own game as DM.

Yes, it would be trying something new. Yes, you might be unsure of yourself. Yes, it would be talking with a bunch of people you probably don't know in real life.

Every DM out there that was a beginner at some point. Even DMs with years of experience don't always feel ready or confident if something is going to go smoothly. And if you're doing it online...there's freedom in not knowing these new people ahead of time.

You don't have to be a voice actor, or make/buy professional-looking materials, or even have things flow smoothly all the time. Let players know upfront that you're new to this and they will be just fine with an unpolished game (and if they're not, they can wait around for another DM to run a game while you get a better player in their place).

DMing is a skill that you learn and improve only by doing it.

There are a ton of resources out there that can help out a new (or even experienced) DM.

* You can watch streamed games and see what other DMs do. Don't copy them, but simply watch/listen to see how they do things and how different DMs do things differently.
* You can read and watch DMing/GMing tips online.
* You can ask questions here or over in r/DMAcademy.
* You can privately ask DMs (such as myself) questions for different situations.

The players are out there, and so, so many of them are just waiting for someone to step up and say, ""Let's play some D&amp;D.""

At first this made me feel terrible and I tried reaching out to a few of them to try to make friends outside of the game, but they didn't seem interested, so I've grown to accept that they like me as a player but no more than that and it's been fine, more or less.  


But with COVID, we're having to change up how we play, and I'm being left out of game related conversations and planning now too, and I've missed several sessions in a row as a result. I don't really think they're deliberately excluding me, but my mind can definitely jump there at times and it's dredging up those early memories of feeling shitty and excluded.  


I've tried discussing my feeling like an outsider with another player in the past to see if there was anything I could do differently, and it was horribly awkward and solved nothing so I don't want to do that again.

fqz3f0,Jedi-master-dragon,DM tip: Don't mix good characters with evil ones {DM},"It is perfectly fine to have evil characters but it's not okay to mix evil characters with good ones.  Here's is a scenario to explain why.

A necromancer finds a graveyard and decides to make herself a few undead servants.  However, she is promptly stopped by two of her party members.  One of the party members is a druid who abhors the idea of making those who have been put to rest back into service and the other is a cleric but not just any cleric, a life domain cleric.  This causes an argument which hampers the effectiveness of the party.

Another scenario.  The spellcaster summons some assistance during the battle but unfortunately his assistance is in the form of a devil he just summoned using Infernal calling.  Immediately, the paladin runs at the devil as well as the caster for summoning such an unholy creature into the material realm.  The devil attacks the paladin but also the very easily pissed off barbarian and after the devil is banish, the barbarian attacks the caster in revenge.

Now for a bit more of a different type of scenario.  The fighter being a man of honor refuses to kill the guards who are unarmed and surrendered themselves.  However the warlock, rogue and sorcerer care little for honor and still kill the guards.  The fighter is appalled by this but his complaints fall on deaf ears for they came to do a job for the Zentarim and they finished.

This comes from experience I have had as a player.  I have played and druid in a party with a necromancer and it never ends well especially when the townsfolk are pissed off that you are resurrecting their loved ones to use their bodies in some kind of sick cannon fodder fashion.  Just talk with your players about this, if the campaign is more of a holy mission from god or a more seedy criminal underworld type game be sure to let your players be aware of the kind of story you plan on telling that way the party doesn't have any kind of nasty problems.",20,1585453013,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqz3f0/dm_tip_dont_mix_good_characters_with_evil_ones_dm/,DnD,1

fqydag,lsalvana,Castlevania based characters,"Hi everyone! Last week of confinement I watched the last season of Netflix's Castlevania. And I was thinking of how to make DnD 5th edition characters based on the three main characters of the Castlevania series: Alucard, Sypha and Trevor. I thought it would be fun and nourishing to share our approaches to it, and might inspire some players and DM's.   


The idea is to present which race, classes, specializations, features, spells and weapons a player would have to choose if they want to play, as faithfully as possible, as Alucard, Sypha or Trevor. To make things a bit spicier, let's limit to the official rules (any supplemental also allowed), except, maybe, for the weapons. You can develop any character, two of them, the three or only details. Any any contribution will be useful.  


Without further ado, thanks in advance to all participants. Let's have fun discussing.

fqyc73,Calixosquid,How to improve my Lore Bard,"So I've been playing in a homebrew campaign for quite a few months now, we are currently level 12 and a little poor (I recently spent most my money begginning construction on a college). My character is a Lore Bard Glasya Teifling with the Folk Hero background, is less than optimized but I would like to make him a little more useful in combat and I'm general. I'll list everything I figure important about him stats-wise and just let me know your opinion on what choices I can make in the following levels. Multiclassing is an option.

Base stats:

Health: 84
Str: 9
Dex: 14
Con: 13
Int: 10
Wis: 11
Cha: 20
(I rolled shit cuz we used a rolling method to give us slightly lower stats)

Spells:

Cantrips: Minor Illusion (Innately), Prestidigitation, Message, Mage Hand, and Vicious Mockery

1st Level: Disguise Self (Innately), Identify, Healing Word, Thunderwave

2nd Level: Invisibility (Innately), Shatter, Gift of Gab

3rd Level: Counterspell (Magical Secrets), Sending

4th Level: Banishment (Magical Secrets), Polymorph, Greater Invisibility, Death Ward

5th Level: Animate Objects, Raise Dead, Scrying,  Legend Lore

6th Level: Mass Suggestion, Heal (Magical Secrets), Disintegrate (Magical Secrets), Otto's Irresistible Dance

My proficiencies are as follows: Animal Handling, Survival, Stealth (Expertise), Persuasion (Expertise), Deception (Expertise), Performance, Intimidation (Expertise) 

Notable Magic Items: +1 Studded Leather Armor, Instrument of the Bards (Caneith Mandolin, flavored is a saxophone). In addition to this there are the macguffins of the campaign (Motes), each relates directly to one of the schools of magic, and with it's powers unlocked can grant us abilities related to them. We currently have Necromancy and Illusion, which we are attuned to (they take up attunement slots like magic items and leave a tattoo on your body). We are on the verge of collecting the enchantment mote. 


Necromancy Mote: 
A small, palm sized Astatine cage that has rusted over the course of many years. It holds an amber statuette of a humanoid, which contains the soul of Dayara Fayn.

Death's Repugnance When you force a creature to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can force the creature to make the save at disadvantage.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to half the Charisma modifier of the attuned creature with the highest Charisma score, rounded up.

Rise of the Grave When an attuned creature deals necrotic damage with a spell or attack, they are healed for half the damage dealt

This feature can be used a number of times equal to half the Charisma modifier of the attuned creature with the highest Charisma score, rounded up.

Ruinous Form As an action, you can push yourself past your limits, and force pure energy through your body, temporarily increasing your physical strength and constitution. You gain the following benefits for one minute, and immediately gain 3 points of exhaustion when it wears off.

Your Strength score increases by 5.

You gain 100 temporary hitpoints.

You become double proficient in Strength and Constitution saving throws.

This ability recharges over the course of a week.



Illusion Mote:
Expend 1 charge for silent image, 3 for major Image, and 5 for creation (10 charges daily)
illusory self: when a creature attacks you use a reaction to make them hit an illusion instead (5/day)
competent casting: advantage on constitution checks while concentrating on an illusion spell
improvised battlefield: as reaction to initiative cast arcane mirage to make a new battlefield (nothing to crazy) (1/long rest)
Sacrificial Illusion: When holding concentration on an illusion spell, you can drop concentration to give someone within 60 feet evasion when they make a dex save
(The illusion mote has changed slightly but the DM hasn't sent us the new copy yet, he says it's just a little easier to keep track of basically)

Feats:
Infernal Constitution: You have advantage vs poison, resist poison and cold


So the utter length of this post has gotten out of hand and I'm sorry for that, as well as the formatting.  But if you're still here then I ask you, what steps would you suggest for making my mess of a character a week bit more optimized? 

I already plan on taking a few more enchantment spells next level because we'll have that mote, and I'm a bard and all.",8,1585449916,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqyc73/how_to_improve_my_lore_bard/,DnD,1

fqy9na,MallowOni,Need to flesh out a couple of world details,"First I should mention this will be a very short campaign, probably 4 sessions just so we can learn how to use Talespire when the beta releases, so I won't have a lot of time to explore these ideas yet but I'll probably use them again down the line.

1) Adventuring is more formalized in this world. Adventurers register with the local branch of the Adventurers' League (too subtle? :P) at each new town or they'll be prohibited from taking official requests from patrons. Requests must also be written out as a contract to ensure the patron gets what they want accomplished and the adventurers get the reward they're promised. Also patrons who hire multiple parties or individuals for a task have to disclose this to anyone they contract with. Anyone who breaks a contract can be subject to, at the discretion of the aggrieved party, jail time, being the target of bounty hunters, or neither of the above.

One thing I haven't worked out though is who would pay the bounty hunters. Another is are there broader social implications to this contract system I should consider?

2) Leveling up is a formally recognized function of this world. Levels are referred to as ""circles"" (thanks Dragon Realms!) so for example a 3rd level wizard is called a 3rd circle wizard.

My question here is how exactly should the level up happen? Should it just spontaneously happen or should there be some process the character goes through? I'm leaning toward the latter but I'm not sure what the process should be.

P.S.
Not that it's important but a result of the contract system is that the word ""quest"" never existed as an independent word in this world. It was just a contraction of ""request"", e.g. ""We've received a request to clear the goblin den"" over time was shortened to ""We've received a 'quest to clear the goblin den'""",0,1585449625,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqy9na/need_to_flesh_out_a_couple_of_world_details/,DnD,1

fqxpfl,Sentriculus,Was introduced to DnD 6 months ago. Now reading 5e DM guide. Here's my first ever continent map--Herbazure [OC],"This is Herbazure, a continent of five provinces that have been at war for generations.  The continents are Gaia, Pompeii, Tanagra, Silverhelm, and the United Kingdoms of the Realm (UKR) and they are predominantly populated by humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, and mixed races respectively.  The cities of Gaia include Frisco, Moon Shadow, and La Rochelle.  The cities of Pompeii are Amon'Nak and Neurrgbach.  The cities in Tanagra are the Gorlak Stronghold, Three Rivers, and Abu Masala.  The cities in Silverhelm are Shingard, Cleveland, and Hambone Mountain.  And the cities in the UKR are Sallux and Shru.  I'm pretty lazy with names.   


The first home-brew will start in the UKR where a young girl (the PC) moves to Shru to start school but some of her classmates and their entire families have been kidnapped.  As classmates continue to go missing, she takes it upon herself to investigate the happenings.  But then, an injured rogue messenger comes to town with an important message that she meant to deliver to the Astrologist in the Observatory, but she was nearly killed by agents of the astral plane (think The Matrix).  The message scroll was stolen, but it is a decoy as the injured messenger has memorized the message and rewrites it for the PC to deliver to the Astrologist.  The PC goes through dangerous jungle to meet the astrologer.  

&amp;#x200B;

There, the astrologer informs her of an ancient grand master plan to restart each race on separate worlds in the galaxy and she hints at a villager in Shru who used to be part of her order.   But suddenly, the astrologer is attacked and kidnapped before the PC's eyes by Astral Agents.  The PC must then return to the village and use the clues she's collected to find out where a hidden castle that houses the Dragon Wizard is to find and free the villagers from his midst.  If the PC survives the four stories of dungeon and defeats the Dragon Wizard, then the story ends with the Astrologer and the Dragon Wizard being Q from Star Trek sending Humans to Earth, Orcs to Kronos, Elves to Romulus, and Dwarves to Ferenginar.  It is supposed to be a cute prequel to Star Trek.",0,1585447451,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqxpfl/was_introduced_to_dnd_6_months_ago_now_reading_5e/,DnD,1

fqxesb,Zone_A3,Spell Interaction Question (Contingency),"So while crafting an encounter involving a relatively high level wizard (has 6th level spells), I started playing around with *Contingency* spell interactions.

&gt;Contingent spell: *Polymorph*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Contingency* trigger: casting the spell *Fire Shield*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Encounter:  Round 1, wizard casts *Mirror Image*, hopefully survives until round 2.  Round 2, wizard casts *Fire Shield*, triggering their contingent *Polymorph* and turns them into a T-Rex (CR 8 beast).  Hilarity ensues.

fqx7sb,Onerandomchicken,Unique game changing power ideas for an Aasimar?,"My players are about to find an injured angel of the god of justice. In my campaign aasimar serve as conduits to the gods, more so than they know/is probably written in dnd lore. In staying near the aasimar the angel will be able to slowly regain her powers and thus complete her story (I want to try and add her as an NPC healer of my party for a while).

But additionally I'd like her to have a bit of a symbiotic relationship with my aasimar (of the same god of justice). In activating his powers near her, I want him to gain powers (that will grow as she heals and regains her own powers). What are some cool, flavorful ideas you have of what that power could be?

\-Maybe a pair of wings? Basic but flight is nothing to scoff at (hes scourge thus why it makes sense to add that)

\-The ability to understand any language while transformed (hard to dispense justice if you don't know what they are saying after all xD)",16,1585445571,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqx7sb/unique_game_changing_power_ideas_for_an_aasimar/,DnD,2
fqx7hi,Reichstein,[Discussion] Does Negative energy kill micro-organisms?,"This may sound like an odd question but hear me out.


I was thinking about how undead creatures in D&amp;D are powered by negative energy, and how negative energy basically kills/weakens any living thing it encounters.  To the point where even touching many undead can be harmful to the living.


In reality when a living organism dies, in order for it to rot it needs to be attacked by bacteria and other micro-organisms, insects, etc.  If this can't happen for some reason, then the organism will, most likely just basically dry out, becoming desiccated/mummified.


In D&amp;D when undead are created they essentially become saturated in negative energy.  This would kill any micro-organisms already in the body and any future ones that come in contact with the now undead creature.  I would think it could also harm or kill larger things such as flies and other insects.


So, with this in mind, any corpse that becomes undead would immediately stop rotting.  They would however continue to deteriorate in various ways as their flesh dries and accumulates damage and normal wear that would no longer heal.


I like the idea of applying this to a newly made Lich.  They would initially look mostly normal, though probably deathly pale.  But over time their flesh would dry and shrink, pulling tight over the bones beneath before eventually cracking and falling away.

So i dont know if the player would be lawful evil since the are loyal and faithful, or if they'd be chaotic evil for following the orders of the npc.

fqwv24,TheBrightLord,How can a paladin be put under mind control?,"(If you're playing a campaign about stopping a plague, don't read this)

Hi everyone,

Relatively new DM here- I've run other campaigns but am new to 5e. In my campaign there's a plot point that involves the BBEG trying to reassemble an (all NPC) adventuring party from years ago and turn them to the other side- basically making an evil, high level party that is working for the BBEG. This NPC were initially almost all killed during their most famous adventure with the exception of the party paladin, who survived through his link with his god (he serves the god of death).

Long story short the BBEG managed to resurrect the other two party members, one of whom is a sorceress and the ex love interest of the paladin. I initially intended for her to use a dominate person spell on the paladin to twist him to their side (also as a major 'oh shit' moment for the party), but THEN I realized Oath of Devotion paladins are immune to charm effects, d'oh. I've already kind of established him as Oath of Devotion and it does make the most sense for his character.

Is there a RAW-friendly way to make this happen (artifact, some sort of creature) or do I have to homebrew something/DM-fiat something?",22,1585444246,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqwv24/how_can_a_paladin_be_put_under_mind_control/,DnD,0

fqwijg,DaxterFlame,Idea Drop #1: The Perfect Soldier,"*(Preface: I like to generate ideas for D&amp;D and come up with things really often. Unfortunately, actually playing the game is nowhere as fun. I hate to see an idea to go waste, so I may sporadically post these ‚Äúidea drops‚Äù so they come to life at someone‚Äôs table, even if I never get to use any myself. Tl;dr is at the end. )*

Some tyrants take over with armies of living soldiers. Others might prefer zombies and skeletons. But this BBEG is taking it a step further: Shadows. Shadows are ethereal, so standard armaments do little to dispatch them. They can slink into the darkness and infiltrate homes to defeat the enemy with no resistance. But most importantly, they self-propagate: every slain enemy is an instant new addition to your army.

Everything begins with a single Shadow. Send it into a peasant village in the middle of the night and kill off the inhabitants, then have those split up and strike at other villages across the countryside. Once your numbers are big enough, you‚Äôre ready to tackle larger towns and even cities. Have your army slink into homes and strike at sleeping targets first, then swarm the stronger victims with insurmountable numbers. Soon enough, you‚Äôll be sitting at the center of an empire with your invisible army, and anyone who so much as speaks out against you risks being added to your legion. And when some misfit group of rebels inevitably shows up at your doorstep anyway, remind them that you‚Äôre keeping the army in check and without your control the Shadows will do the thing they know best: snuffing out all life around them.

Perhaps you want to take this a step further. Perform a ritual to blot out the sun so your army never loses its strength. Develop new, more powerful shadows to take down more dangerous enemies, expand your ranks to include other ethereal undead, or devise a way to put a stop to that pesky holy magic. If the players do slay the BBEG, maybe the next campaign arc can be about trying to survive in a world ravaged by these undead. On the other hand, if you think this might get too out of control for the players, allow them to put a stop to the plan in its earliest stages instead of later on.

The most lore-friendly way to execute this is with a Shadow Dragon, whose breath weapon produces Shadows that it directly controls; it‚Äôs not a stretch to say Shadows born from those ones are also under its command. But a powerful wizard with the proper spell can serve the role just as well, as can any warlord who happens across a device that controls Shadows. 

**Tl;dr:** The BBEG is a Shadow Dragon, wizard, or some other being that can control Shadows. They quickly grow an army of Shadows by striking small villages before moving up to larger targets and ultimately conquering the world/kingdom/province/etc. When the players confront the BBEG, they will happily remind everyone that they keep the Shadows in check, and without their influence the army will start mercilessly slaughtering innocents by itself.",5,1585442957,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqwijg/idea_drop_1_the_perfect_soldier/,DnD,3
fqwhyu,Leytra,Can you subvert Alarm?,"Title says it all really.

If a room has alarm cast on it, is it atall possible to subvert the alarm spell and get around without waking the caster up?

The only idea I have is antimagic field to disable the spell but that would be noticable when they wake up that the spell vanished. Is there any untracable way of getting past an alarm spell.

EDIT: Realised I need extra context, so here it is.

Bank heist. The only entrance to the vault is a room that is kept constantly warded by alarm spells, I can get into the entrance easily, but I need to get past the alarm spell.

I can't use fixed teleporting like dimension door for x feet because I don't know anything about the rooms beyond the vault entrance, and I need to get past this alarm spell to recon the rest of the vault layout for the thing I'm looking for. 

I've got a rogue, a wizard, and an oathbreaker paladin at 15th level each to deploy the talents of, this is some proper oceans' eleven shit but with three people and lots of magical traps. 

Right now though, all I need to do is bypass this entrance room. I can evade visual detection I've got greater invisibility, the only thing I can't think a way to bypass is this alarm spell.",15,1585442895,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqwhyu/can_you_subvert_alarm/,DnD,3
fqwgxf,C4_567,"For Homebrew, how do you come up with what your architecture looks like? (for a city)","My main setting's capital city is called Obenstraad.

It's tiefling ruled, populated by all the races though, has a tremendous emphasis on diverse practice &amp; acceptance of religion (even for dark deities) and is divided into an impoverished slum section behind the exterior walls, and a wealthier inner city behind the interior walls (Large bridges connecting these walls in a few places around the city so nobility can move in and out of the city without stepping foot in the slums).

When I think of this city, I know I've always had a pale yelllow (maybe even white but that feels too similar to Gondor from LotR) in mind when it comes to color scheme, both for the walls and the buildings. My initial thoughts were sandstone, or maybe clay, but geographically, sandstone wouldn't make sense

I know I wanted the city surroundings to be grasslands, so Sandstone/Clay woudn't really make *a ton* of sense, given that wood and stone would probably be much easier building materials. Sure, this is D&amp;D and I *could* do whatever, but I'd like my world to make sense too. At the same time, I've reserached, and can't find any materials that would suit the needs here.

My big question though, is what should the buildings look like? If they aren't stone cottages or wooden cabins, I don't have a good reference for what architecture might look like across a city like this. Maybe the nobility could live in more traditional Medieval Europe style homes like that in the inner city, but I definitely had a ""homes stacked on top of homes"" concept in mind for the slums (For anyone who know's what Harran is from Dying Light, something like that, but for medieval times)

[\\""Harran\\"" Slums from Dying Light](https://preview.redd.it/ylythorraip41.png?width=1366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=488e42d3ad276909964578ce2fd8c22fa3bd4ecc)

The thing is, I don't know enough about architecture to know what building materials would be used for the color/design I'm looking for, and because I'd have to convert all the modern elements of this picture into medieval-appropriate ones, I don't have a great idea of how to even start the process.

I've designed an orc city in the past (different continent) that utilized cubical/dome clay huts on top of a large plateau surrounded by a ravine (kind of like Thunderbluff from WoW, but in a desert setting), as well as tunnels burrowed into that plateau.

Point, being, re-using that same Azteci hut design for two cities completely unrelated to each other would be weird.

TL;DR

I'm stuck on what I should make my capital city's building look like, don't know enough about architecture to figure it out myself, and am now coming to Reddit to brainstorm. My ideas for it being:

* Yellow color scheme, but sandstone wouldn't make sense in a land-locked grasslands environment without figuring out some sort of excuse (Point is that its not traditional European stone/wood)
* Buildings capable of being stacked and cramped (like the slums shown in the picture)
* NOT the Aztec look of clay huts. I already used that for an orc city, and two cities made out of cubes feels lazy. It made sense for orcs, because they aren't exactly ""elegantly-inclined"", but not every city can be made up of blocks. Poor or not, Obenstraad is a lot more civilized.

**I'm gonna keep working on this city on my own, but if anybody has ideas of their own, even if they deviate from any of the things I've mentioned above, by all means, throw it out there. Like I said, I'd love for this to be a brainstorming thread.**",5,1585442787,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqwgxf/for_homebrew_how_do_you_come_up_with_what_your/,DnD,2

My friend wants to host a 3.5edition game with me in it. So I went ahead and wrote up a backstory for my character. But I'm too unfamiliar with the classes in dnd to be able to pick an appropriate class that allows for this character. I know what skills this character needs to have, what weapon he's supposed to use, and kinda know what role he's supposed to take in the party. Just not what class to start him as. 

Without posting the backstory; the character will be a melee combatant that combines dancing and the use of pole-arms (looked through the weapon list on some dnd website and thought the glaive would be most fitting). They will probably need to be one of the front line fighters. So they would need some way of surviving and I figured, since they're a dancer, it'd be dodging. Furthermore, the character would also need to know how to act as well and knows the language of the Gnoll race. 

With a bit of research on my part, it looked like my most likely candidates were Fighter(Sounds like you're expected to be a tank), Ranger(melee combat seems focused on duel weapons), Monk(only lacks ability to use glaives) and Bard(Character would not be a spell user and would not know much lore).  
 

It‚Äôs a bit past what I‚Äôm asking but; as far as stats go, I figured I‚Äôd need to focus on dexterity and charisma, give some thought to strength and Constitution and leave intelligence and wisdom as lower priority, to fit the character.

fqvxb9,dannyfang54,cleric but extra cleric and 3 bards,"so basically the thing is I'm creating a character for a sesh tomorrow and I've recently been messing around with theurgy wizard where I basically multiclass from cleric into cleric for cool combinations or such, so the campaign starting tomorrow is going to be rise of tiamat and the party consists of a ranger, 3 bards, and paladin, I basically am the fill that's going to support these guys or buff em or whatever, what kind of cleric cleric combo should I build?
so far I have these mixtures that seemed interesting to me and I was wondering what would be the best 2 cleric subclasses to fit in with this party, or if you've played rise of tiamat before and know what works well you can also mention that,

forge+war
arcana+knowledge
arcana +light
arcana+tempest
tempest+twilight
protection+unity
protection+life
protection +light
life +grave
forge+twilight
war+twilight
unity+life
knowledge+order
order+trickery
trickery+twilight

for extra clarification I am taking cleric and school of theurgy wizard which enables me to take 2 subclasses of cleric

feel free to explain your reason and really any general advice would work for me, if you give out a new combination I'd appreciate it if you broke it down to me as to what I get from it, and if any other multiclassed could compliment certain combos

thank you

Flavor info: This is an evil campaign. My warlock follows a Vecna, lies and deception, type patron. So far mask of many faces and suggestion have been awesome in this area. My character was raised in a religious cult that trains spys for the ‚ÄúVecna‚Äù type patron. 

Statistics: I‚Äôm a Drow, 6th level pact of the chain Hexblade (I think the other subclasses are underpowered in comparison, plus I think my armor keeps me alive). I would like to be a manipulator/controller....but right now I‚Äôm just hexing people and spamming eldritch blast. I have ok dps because of antagonizing blast, hex, and maddening hex (maybe 15-25 per round). Also I love my chain familiar for the versatility and the magic resistance. 

Are there any good spells or invocations that can make good combos? I know dps can be useful but I‚Äôd like do more than spam Eldritch blast. Also sometimes I need something of a higher caliber to be effective in combat.

fqv8ap,Asbjorn_Greymane,Help with rp.,"Hi guys.  Need a bit of help.

Im a DM and a player in a few campaigns.  The thing I come asking today is how do I get my players to rp more? When I started the campaign I stated that this would be a rp heavy campaign.  They all understood this. 
But whenever they are thrown a social encounter it's like only one person is participating, and they're just waiting for the next fight.  They're on their phones alot and often don't even remember what character they're playing.  Their character backstories are really thin.  I have spoken to them quite a bit and offered to help them flesh out  their backstories, but nope. 

I know I sound like I'm moaning but I've put so much time and money into the campaign and I feel like it's all for naught.  Very tempted to stop the campaign and find some new folks. Or the same people but explain to them the importance of rp more.   

Any tips would be great, thank you.",11,1585438317,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqv8ap/help_with_rp/,DnD,4

After waiting about an hour I finally saw him I grabbed my bow and an arrow notched it, drew back, took a deep breath and fired.

fqv0m2,MyComicBox,All right guys. We need to have a serious discussion about a main component in D&amp;D.,"Dice. The little polyhedrons that serve to randomly generate a number.

&amp;#x200B;

Why are we so addicted to collecting them?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing D&amp;D for about 6 months at the time of this post (I've been having a blast btw), and so far, I have 11 sets of dice, plus a few loose dice. But for some reason, even though 11 of each die is enough for most situations, that's not enough for me. I need more.

At first, I was like ""Well, you never know when you need to roll... 27d6..."" or ""Well, what if I'm a DM for... 13 players... and they each needed several sets?"" But there's no excuse now. I don't think I'll truly be satisfied until I have enough dice to fill a bathtub.

And I'm not alone on this. A lot of fellow D&amp;D nerds, especially r/dndmemes, have mentioned their need to collect more dice, no matter how many there are in their possession.

My question is: Why is this such a widespread phenomenon across the D&amp;D community (and maybe even fans of other tabletop RPGs)? Is it as simple as ""mmmm shiny math rocks go clicky clacky"", or is there something deeper?",22,1585437581,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqv0m2/all_right_guys_we_need_to_have_a_serious/,DnD,6

fqudo5,SoyMuyAlto,Tabaxi can run ungodly fast!,"Tabaxi have a movement speed of 30ft. Level that tabaxi up to be an 18th level monk and now they have a movement speed of 60ft. Also get them to 2nd level in fighter (important later). Cast *longstrider* on them and they'll have a movement speed of 70ft. Now use their *feline agility* feature to double their speed to 140ft. Cast *haste* on them to double their speed again to 280ft.

This tabaxi can now use their movement to go 280ft, their dash action to move another 280ft, the extra action from the *haste* spell to dash another 280ft, their *action surge* feature to dash another 280ft, and finally their *step of the wind* feature to use their bonus action to dash another 280ft. In total, they will have moved 1400ft in 6 seconds, or 159.09 mph (256.032 kph).

I would argue that the Tabaxi could use themselves as an improvised weapon at these speeds. Being that this is about six percent faster than terminal velocity, which one can reach after falling 1500ft, which in D&amp;D 5e terms would deal 150d6 bludgeoning damage, I'd say that if a tabaxi run head on into another person, they would each take half of 150d6 damage.",15,1585435403,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqudo5/tabaxi_can_run_ungodly_fast/,DnD,5

Now that that's not really an option, in the interest of getting a game going sooner rather than later, I'm thinking of using an established campaign setting and/or pre-written adventures, which I've never done before, and now a VTT has become more of a necessity.

Wildemount looks very intriguing as a setting. I've looked into using both D&amp;D Beyond for managing the campaign and Roll20 as a VTT. I played around with the free Wildemount adventure in Roll20; I'm not super fond of the cold-weather setting for that adventure, but the content seems really great.

fqu6vw,rthive,Have to share this one...,"So, we started a new campaign via discord, and our dm pretty much gave us free reign to create our characters. A friend, who is playing for the first time ever, asked our dm how crazy can that backstory be, and our dm told him to go wild, and if anything didn't fit with the setting, he would let him know.

So my friend created a cleric/monk that originally was a cat that got lost from home. A literal CAT. And some God of mischief decided to transform him into a human, and send him to spread the good news of his power. The thing is, being a God of mischief, my friend's character still behaves like a cat. He pushes cups and other stuff from the table, ignores some of the people that try to talk to him, suddenly he climbs to walls or roofs, etc. And my friend is playing him MASTERFULLY. I think I haven't laughed so hard for a very long time.

Besides, his story arc is getting quite interesting, with this God of mischief and his quest to evangelize the realm.

fqtur1,CriLizElf,Bard Echo Knight Multiclass?,"Hey Reddit! Now that The Explorer's Guide to Wildemount is out, I've been looking at the subclasses quite a bit. I've never had any strong desire to play as a fighter, but the Echo Knight has changed that for me. I'm currently in a Campaign where I play as a Ghostwise Halfling Lore Bard. Our DM allows multiclassing, and I know he'd let me multiclass into this, but I'm still uncertain as to if I want to do it or not because it could make my character worse in the long run. I don't care too much about how optimized the character is, but I don't want to fall too far behind. The Barbarian in our party has been showing my Bard how to fight so this would be a perfect reason to multiclass, but I don't know how far I want to go. I might even take as many as 5 levels to get extra attack if that won't hurt my character too much. Any thoughts?

fqt1z5,Fylu02,Rogue Subclass: Arcane Duelist,"This subclass was created by combining Arcane trickster and swashbuckler to create an Arcane duelist subclass. It uses the eldritch Knight Spellcasting Progression and all abilities were taken from existing subclasses.

# Spellcasting

When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

Cantrips

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

Spell Slots

The Arcane Duelist Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Arcane Duelist Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

# Dueling

Starting at 3rd level, you analyze the battle before you engage. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

# Magical Ambush

Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell this turn.

# Arcane Strike

At 13th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

# Spell Thief

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

fqst5b,Bweeze086,DM looking to up his story game.,"I've been running a home brew for awhile and I'm having issues with ""setting the hook"" into my players. 

To sum up the story so far:
There is an underground bad guy group
Some players like group
Bad guys attack a knighting ceremony 
Everyone gets conscripted and needs to go do a mission 
Go to cave, talk to some young ferry dragons
Learn just a little more about bad guys

At this point in our story, my players still think they're just being used as soldiers by the kings guard and I'm worried I'm doing a bad job at dropping hints.

First hint was a letter they found that said ""the truth of the dark spine"" with a map leading them to a nearby mountainous island.

Second hint was the dragons they fought who told them that the black spine wasnt really about giving power to the people.

After they cleared the cave and returned to the city. Explained what they had found to the guards, they felt lost. I tried to help push them with an assassin approaching and telling them to leave well enough alone and keep their nose out of it.

2 characters actually left and fully joined up with the bad guys. That's all well and good, they might actually figure out what's going on first.

Do you have any tips for hooking the players into the hooks? I almost had to railroad them into going to the island. Once they actually figure out that dragons are behind the bad guys and that there are several cities that are effected, I'm sure it will help motivate.

What are some tips for these earlier sessions?",10,1585430354,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqst5b/dm_looking_to_up_his_story_game/,DnD,2

fqsfca,OlomertIV,Making CoS Weirder (xpost?),"So I originally posted this on a DM subreddit, but it didn't belong there and wasn't approved; no hard feelings, such is life. Hopefully you all will enjoy it!

TL;DR I'm running a Curse of Strahd campaign for my group and, due to some admittedly sloppy prep work, accidentally introduced some odd flavor into Barovia that my players seem to find a little more intriguing than the main story line.  I thought I'd share for anyone prepping a Curse of Strahd run to consider.

Blinksy, the Multidimensional Toy Maker:

-My mistake: I thought Blinksy's shop was in the village of Barovia and the map I was sharing with my players just didn't mention it for some reason.

-My solution: Blinksy has a shop in every town, even Berez.  The shops' outer appearance all conform to the style of building surrounding them, but the signage and the inside of the shop are all the same, because the inside of the shop is an actual, fixed location and the outside is... Well, whatever works for you here.  For me it's just a part of the curse Madam Eva placed on him, but for you it could be kind of a TARDIS thing.  

-The story thread: Blinksy used to be a normal Barovian named Heinrich Spielzeughersteller and something of a rival to Pidlwick I.  Madam Eva, being quite fond of Pidlwick I and believing Blinksy had a hand in his death, cursed Blinksy with his greatest desire: to make toys for all children.  Naturally this included a touch of madness, which explains why his toys are so disturbing (I play him very scatterbrained and maybe kind of stupid, but to each their own).  My version of Blinksy does not know about Pidlwick I or II.

Blinksy is unaware that he is open for business in every town, never leaves the shop, does not need to eat or drink or relieve himself, and if asked about anything related to the above or his own past seems confused and hurt, like he vaguely remembers a trauma, and then shakes it off.  He will not willingly leave the shop under any circumstance.  If forcibly removed from his shop, once outside the threshold into whatever town the party is in, he will let out a loud and unnatural scream, convulse, turn into ash, and dissipate into the sky like paper on a campfire.  Once the party does this to every Blinksy, Madam Eva's curse is lifted and Heinrich's soul returns to the Barovian purgatory.

If Strahd is defeated after this occurs, Heinrich's soul is free to move on to an afterlife, as is everyone else's.  If Strahd is defeated before this occurs, you could have Blinksy occur in every town on your planet, as I intend to.

Pidlwick II, the Monstrosity Doll

-My mistake: the party was wasting its time interrogating Blinksy about Gertruda and I was attempting to encourage them to leave by having Blinksy threaten them with an especially foul doll: a horse headed, mallard-head armed (left), trident armed (right), crab claw legged (both), living doll that   cried out in agony and exuded an opaque, viscous fluid of some kind.  Obviously they love this thing, gladly accepted it, and named it Golden Child.

-My solution: I've just made this thing Pidlwick II with some tweaks.  It's a lesser demon, essentially, that is currently converting our fighter to evil and the side of Strahd.

-The Story Thread: When the Dark Forces of Evil‚Ñ¢ turned Strahd and created the demiplane of Barovia as we know it, some of them decided to take a hands on role in shaping the land and populace towards their purposes.  Pidlwick II is one such entity and its sole purpose is madness and mayhem.  It bonds with one person at a time and attempts to dominate their mind and soul (mechanically I've made this a once a day and some special events wisdom save with an increasing DC, start at 5 and move up in increments of 2 or 3, a nat 20 gives the player knowledge of what this thing is and what it is doing).  Strahd knows about it and you can still have it perform many of the same story and mechanical functions as module Pidlwick II.

The Other Party:

-My mistake: The party didn't seem very intrigued by or scared of Strahd when they first encountered him.  I think I took too long to introduce him after the proper ""so powerful, so evil"" expository dump.  Then again, maybe the cleric is just overconfident/stupid.  They are already level 5 from a previous campaign and just defeated a vampire spawn trap Strahd used to test them.  He introduces himself and invites them  to the castle, and is intrigued by their motivations.  They don't care and cleric insults him repeatedly.  I don't really want to kill cleric so early in this campaign, so I let them persuade him to give them a task in exchange for their lives.

-My solution: There is another party of adventurers looking to destroy Strahd.  They have 1d10 days to find and kill this party or both parties will be destroyed by Strahd within 2d10 days after deadline, at his leisure and amusement, naturally.  If they succeed they get to leave Barovia, if they betray him or fail, it's still amusing for Strahd.  He even tells the party where the targets were last seen/where they are headed.  What a cool guy!

-The Story Thread: They are your standard mercenary type heroes. They heard the tales of an undefeatable monster, a scared and oppressed people, and just so much treasure you guys.  I made 7 lvl3 characters for a balanced adventuring party, rolled a d4 to see how many had died, and a couple d10s to see which ones died.  Naturally these guys are major dicks, but logically it is better to try and attack Strahd with larger numbers and this party, at least, knows that.  Bing, bang, boom a ticking clock mission with dire consequences.  The party seems more interested in siding with Strahd at this point, but I suppose we'll see.

The Suicide Cult:

-This one hasn't come up yet, so I haven't made a mistake to correct (yet).

-The Story Thread: Some Barovians can recall their past lives and are therefore aware they are in an eternal purgatory like cycle of life and death.  The futility of their existence leads them to a sort of hedonistic philosophy where they do whatever they want fearing only pain and displeasure, and of course holding games where people cheer each other on towards a self inflicted end to their current state.  I plan on having this cult located in or around Kresk, but may change my mind based on the party's activities.

And that's it for now!  I hope you've enjoyed at least one of these ideas and encourage any and all to use, adapt, expand upon, or dismiss the whole lot of them.

Cheers

I‚Äôve been looking for hours but I can‚Äôt find anything. He‚Äôs a Wood Elf life Cleric. I‚Äôll drop his backstory so you can have some knowledge to work off.

Backstory: 

Modnoc Mungam was born into a small community of wood elves almost a century and a half ago. When he reached adolescence he pursued the line of a Cleric of Sune, the major god his community prayed to. He became deeply invested in the philosophy and morals of the practice rather than playing into the power pyramid the other acolytes fed. This was one of the first strikes he received from the village elders, though he was entirely unaware of this.


Modnoc absorbed the morals from The Book Of Sune, holding them dear. He used them to help his community, protecting them, feeding them, entertaining them. However, he refused to take part in the traditions, the idea of solely relying on Sune to live. He found it impossible that she had the time to take care of them and aid life around the world. This caused some slight disruption among his community, how could someone be such a prime example of what Sune but not follow tradition. This would be strike two.


Modnoc was out gathering a number of healing herbs to help with a sickness that ailed his people when he happened upon a beautiful woman. He asked if she was lost, was she hurt, could he help her anyway, and she just laughed. She told him she was Sune, that his people were in danger. He gawked and begun asking how to help them and Sune flashed a smile. ""You were right in assuming I can't help everyone all the time. I may be a God, but even I am not that powerful."" He didn't know how to feel about that, on one hand he was right, but fear outweighed satisfaction. ""I need you to tell them this: They are in danger and tradition will not save them."" And with that, she disappeared, leaving a confused, overwhelmed, and scared Modnoc standing in the forest.


After shock faded, he rushed back to the village, he needed to save them. He burst into the Elders' Court and told them of everything that happened, also adding in what they should do. The Elders looked surprised, angered, scared, and then requested to be alone to discuss. They didn't believe him but needed him gone, he was a danger to village and a danger to their power. They brought him back the next day, telling him that they agreed. They told him that they would handle their village, informing them and helping them through it. The council told him that he needed to leave, to warn others of what Sune has said. 


The idea was the best plan of action, so he quickly agreed. He bid his farewells to his family and packed his bags to leave the following morning to spread the word of Sune. Unaware to him, he left his village to perish in the hands of ignorant elders.

fqs0z8,NoviceRhino,Need Help understanding Kalashtar history.,"I understand Kalashtar was Quori who fused with willing monks and then became Kalashtar.

In the wiki though they say this:

  
"" The kalashtar first appeared in Eberron 1,800 years ago, after fleeing their home realm Dal Quor in search for refuge. (***Whilst in Dal Quor they were being persecuted for religious and philosophical differences by the Dreaming Dark and were hunted by its agents until the kalashtar leader, Taratai, found a way to escape into Eberron. The kalashtar were only quori until Taratai convinced the Adaran monks to willingly fuse their spirits with the quori to form the first kalashtar.)*** There were originally sixty-seven monks at the temple.""

While in Dal Quor they were hunted down for their differences, but where they still Quori then or did they get hunted down as Kalashtar, then they escaped into Eberron?


I am trying to find out where in this timeline did they become kalashtar and how? Trying to write up a background or have some history with my Druid Kalashtar in case the group ask's about it.

fqrwen,Cadet_3762,The Plummet,"In our latest session our group was searching for a (nazi) archmage -details in the comments for those who are interested- in his lair. We teleport to a demiplane and begin searching, we come across a room with a totem pole with 4 spinnavle sections, each with the numbers 1-8 on them (essentially a magical combination lock) we investigate the room and realise the corners lead to four separate areas, details in the comments.

In the last room we enter into a room there is a flat plateau for ~50 feet, and then a sheer drop for longer than our 60ft darkvision. At the edge is a spectre/ghost, the ghost sees the party and gets a surprise round as we all (verbally) assumed it was harmless. It possesses our rogue, and throws her off the cliff face. The Dungeon Master describes her falling through the darkness, and then a crack as she lands. He rolls. He rolled 15D6, 150 ft fall. 66 damage or more will instantly kill our rogue... he rolls 31 (a shocking average of 2, normally its 4), it was appalling (amazing) rolling. The party celebrates but we still have to save her. Our shadow monk (myself) shadow-steps into an alcove 40ft down, and prepares to use a rope and shadow-step to get the rest of the way down, however he himself is possessed by a second spirit who throws him from the cliff too. Our rogue has failed a death save, everything is tense. The DM rolls 11D6, 42 damage, on the dot, enough to knock the monk unconscious, but he uses slow fall, reduces the damage by 30 and runs to the rogue. She passes her next save, the rest of the party are fighting the spirits. The next turn rolls around, he peels a sticker off of her jacket (robe of useful items), a healing potion appears in his hand, but that‚Äôs his action. The rogue rolls another success but it‚Äôs still tense. The fighting continues, and the cleric jumps down, using clever use of a spell (gust of wind? 2nd level spell, 15ft cylinder of air?) to prevent death, the monk uses the potion on the rogue, she wakes up.

When she wakes up she visibly blinks out of existence, this is because of an unknown ailment, a curse they believe, which causes her to turn or flash invisible when panicked or having a breakdown, which occurs more and more often since her second revival from the dead. They try to figure out how to escape the chasm, but nothing comes forward, until the rogue remembers the robe of useful items! She draws a patch off, (represented as a black triangle), and the group go quiet, plenty of speculation has gone into the triangle, but no one knows what it is. Someone whispers ‚Äòit‚Äôs a bomb‚Äô the DM just chuckles and starts laughing to himself. He gets himself under control and describes how the patch disintegrates, leaving behind a metal triangle which soon heats and warps and bends, forming the shape of a T with the ‚Äòwings‚Äô bent upwards, everyone is confused until the DM finishes his sentence ‚ÄòAs the metal cools and the 1ft long piece of metal rests in your hands, it shoots out hair from all surfaces, you now hold a 1 1/2 ft long fake beard.‚Äô The table descended into utter hysterics. The night ends with the rogue (still invisible) putting the beard on, the dungeon master describes as it melds to her face, fitting naturally, feeling like a perfectly normal beard, with the metal no where to be found, and no character had yet to see her. That, my friends, is the story of, The Plummet.",1,1585427481,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqrwen/the_plummet/,DnD,2

fqru73,EeplesandBeeneenees,Cleric Appreciation Post,"Copy-pasting a comment I made on another thread. I felt bad for word-vomiting my love for Clerics on another person's post.

I'm new to D&amp;D, always had an interest, but only started playing around Nov 2019. I love roleplaying and was a little sad when I read online that the role-play aspect for Clerics is generally pretty low. Boy, was I wrong. 

Copy-paste:
""I really wanted to play a ""bog witch"" -y type character, but when I realized that we had two fighters and a rogue, I panickingly switched to a Hill Dwarf Life Cleric. The first few sessions, I wasn't feeling it, but once I got more spell slots and my fighters got better armor and started using action surge, they became meat shields and I, as a plate-armored Dwarven Life Cleric with a CON of 19, became an unstoppable force of Holy Fury. ""Yeh, sure, you can have a heal, I'll just let the Buster Sword and my army of Moogles absolutely nuke this baddie while I'm occupied with your bad decisions."" I'm absolutely in love with my character now, and I don't ever want to not be a Cleric.

Edit: Cleric can be nasty whether you're healing or dealing damage, but it takes ""prep work."" At least for me. For the first few rounds of combat, I'm setting up my spirit guardians and spiritual weapon while buffing the party, so until all that's set up, I do feel pretty useless. But once everything is where it needs to be and I only have to either not get hit or pass a CON save and spit fire at these boys. Took me a while to get the hang of it. Furthermore, I just love being able to switch my spells out depending on what we're doing that day. In a foreign city where nobody can/will speak common and really hates Dwarves? Not a problem. Surrounded by undead? Fantastic! In combat in a swamp with two dwarves and two melee characters? Here ya go, have some Water Walking to alleviate this rough terrain""

My character, Gemmwyn, is a young Hill Dwarf who was surrendered to the church after her family hit hard times. No hard feelings, she had a great life and learned the importance of kindness, joy, empathy, and love growing up volunteering with the less-fortunate and elderly with her church. She was embraced by the Dwarven Pantheon's one and only Reverend Mother, Berronar Truesilver, Deity of Hearth and Home and sent on a lifelong quest of spreading joy and happiness across the world. Doing odd jobs, ridding storehouses of rats, fundraising for orphanages and hospitals. She ran into a crazy bunch of wayward adventurers who had no true homes or families and stuck with them. They were her new family and stuck with her through good and bad times. Even the CE rogue who tragically lost her husband and children after being caught liberating slaves in her hometown and surrounding areas went out of her way to stealthily make dresses fit (with a tinkerers kit) the stocky young dwarf. We lost a friend last session, Tordrid ""Meat Shield"" Caebrek, and Gemma is having a very rough go at it. He got his brain sucked out by a big bad Mind Flayer, and Gemma watched it happen and couldn't do anything to help. Stay tuned for an update if you want, although this will probably get buried.

Again, I'm so sorry for the word vomit, but I just really love my class/character.",5,1585427292,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqru73/cleric_appreciation_post/,DnD,4
fqrtz3,TheGreatKashar,My experiences with a player that hates me.,"My first real text post on this subreddit, yay me. Please bare with me, as I tend to ramble.

\[IMPORTANT INFO\]Me = Me, The Noob monk

Tod = DM

Jessie =  The DPS Fighter

Dan = The healer Paladin

Jose = The one crazy murder hobo rogue

Jen = The player who hates me (Also a Rogue)

\[BACKSTORY\]

I got into DnD 5th edition around my first year in middle school, and joined a group ran by my dad's work buddy at a local game store. Tod's a nice guy, and an all around good DM, though he doesn't really deal with in-party fighting or arguments, and just lets things flow naturally. I was introduced into Tod's game a little bit after it started, and if I'm remembering correctly he was DM-ing the Princes of Elemental Evil module: Something about elemental cultists plaguing the lands.

I was quickly introduced to the party at large, Jessie, Dan, and Jose were all nice enough, if a bit out there in some cases; though none of them play with Tod and I all these years later. Jen however, was always there, long before anyone else in the group, and he's still there to this day. I still to this day do not know why Jen plays DnD. He doesn't role play, he hardly talks, he ignores most of the story, and all of his characters have no arch or development. He just rolls dice. I'll be splitting this all into Incidents, for the sake of keeping things consistent.

\[INCIDENT #1 GUARDS\]

So my first real DnD session starts as the party is already in progress to a mine/temple high in the mountains, on order by... somebody (It was years ago, bite me), to rid the place of cultists in exchange for a large sum of gold. The group was already basically at the mountain slope as I joined, and Tod made up a story about how my Character, a Way of the Open Hand Monk, was sent by our quest-giver to help rid the place.

We progress normally, solving a few puzzles Tod cooked up, fighting some random encounters, but we eventually made it to the entrance to the temple, and our Rogue spied some robed guards at the entrance, but no body else. Jose purposed murdering them from afar with magic and arrows, but Dan talked him down and came up with a plan. The party had found a robe similar to the one's worn by the guards to the temple, and purposed that one of use disguise ourselves and see if we can distract the guards to let the rest of the party sneak in.

Jen instantly elects me to do it, remarking that I was the most expendable since I didn't know how to play the game yet (That hurt on my first ever game session). I speak out of character to the DM and ask what skill I would use to convince the guards I was one of them. Tod explained deception and persuasion, and how it was based on Charisma. I felt a sinking feeling, as my character had the lowest charisma of the bunch at a glance. a -1. I tried explaining to Jen that I shouldn't be the one to go, since my Charisma was so low, and Instantly Jen gets on my case for 'meta gaming' (A term I didn't even know the meaning of at the time)

""What's Charisma? Your character doesn't know what that is."" he told me. I felt embarrassed for doing this thing that was clearly not socially acceptable at the table, and took the robe and played my part. Lo, and behold that I failed my deception check and the two guards instantly attacked me without any hesitation. The battle doesn't go terribly well, and my Monk is pretty badly hurt by this point. Dan, the Paladin tries to heal me, but Jen purposefully suggests that Dan keep his lay on hands for the dungeon ahead, saying that my character didn't looks THAT bad. I was on 4 Hp, for the record. But, I got on my feet and we beat the dungeon without much more of note happening.

\[INCIDENT #2 JAIL\]

Tod is a pretty fickle DM sometimes, and only 2 sessions after we were taking on the Cultists in one plot line, we were kidnapped by Dark Elves and were thrown into another one. I don't know if it was of his own creation, or if he just decided to switch modules suddenly, but the elemental cultists never came back, and we were in the under dark until the story ended.

We spent the next few sessions as slaves in a Dark Elf quarry, and the aim of the party was to escape and get our items back. Jose, the hobo rouge, had actually obtained a magic dagger that he could summon back to his hand at any time, so the plan was to use this secret weapon to kill one of the Slave Drivers, and use his armor as a disguise to get into the main building and get our weapons back. That was, at least the plan most of the party had. Jen, meanwhile, had his own plan.

Using a lockpick that he stole from another slave, Jen managed to get into the item storage room before any of us, and actually opened up a back entrance for the party to get in through. The issue? My monk had taken the Drow Armor and had already entered the building by himself. Why did I go through with this whole disguise plan twice knowing I had low Charisma? Because my character was in fact a dark elf, and we all agreed a dark elf in dark elf armor would be much less suspicious than a Human, or Half Orc.

So Jen gets Jessie, Dan, and Jose's attention long before my part of the plan can be completed, and gets them their items too. Now fully equipped again, Jen immediately suggests that the party go through a tunnel he discovered near the Item room to escape, despite the fact my monk was still in the building, and knew none of this. Dan, thankfully, being the Lawful-Good Paladin (Not the stupid kind) convinced the party to stay and wait for my arrival so I wouldn't be left behind, despite Jen profusely encouraging the party to leave me for dead. Luckily, I got there and we made our escape.

\[INCIDENT #3 SLIME\]

This will be the last thing I go into on this post at least, as it's already getting kinda long. Around 6 sessions later, so around 9 total games  under my belt, and our party is now firmly around level 6 and have explored a fair bit of the under dark. We come across a trading post, and split the party for ease of buying items. Jessie and Dan go looking for potions and scrolls, and Me, Jose, and Jen go looking for Lizard Mounts (Long story, but we needed lizard mounts).

The shopping excursion went about as well as you could expect, and it gave our characters a moment to... actually interact as characters. Me and Jose had a pretty good time of it, but Jen simply refused to interact with either of us in a role play sense. Eventually we got to a large wall the divided the trading post in half, and saw several merchants around the door. Apparently that section of the post was sealed off earlier in the day several monsters appeared. We, being the adventurous type, decided to take on these monsters (Yes, we were two men down, but me and Jose were relatively new players and didn't know the split party rule yet)

The merchants step aside and let us through, before instantly slamming the door on us and locking it, in case we fail. Charming. We wonder in further for a bit, before the DM asks Jose to roll a D 12. Natural 12, that can only be a good thing right? NOPE. 12 acidic oozes appear from behind carts, and shacks, and surround us. Roll initiative.I get a natural one, while Jose and Jen get around a 25 and 23 respectively. Jose leaps on top of a shack tries firing an arrow at the slimes. Doesn't work whatsoever, so he basically ends his turn there.

But Jen meanwhile, he does something so antagonistic that I can hardly put into words. He leaps on top of a shack as well for safety, and then using a magic helmet he found not long ago that lets his cast High Level Illusion magic, casts the Major Illusion spell on MY MONK to make him look like a walking rusty suit of armor. A rusty suit of armor, while surrounded by 12 acidic oozes.Every. Single. Ooze. Gets a turn before me, and tears through my HP. I fall to 0 hit points, and am basically getting gang banged by slime monsters. I roll a death saving throw, which lands on a 20, thankfully, but as Jen's next turn rolls around, he chooses to fire an arrow at the Slime attacking me.

Tod, champion DM he is, basically tells Jen not to do this, as the slime is currently eating me, arrows don't work on slimes, and if he shot at it, he would surly hit my character, and give me a negative death saving throw. All jen says is ""Ok"", and rolls to hit. He hits, me, not the slime, for 8 damage, and I take a death penalty. Thankfully both the fighter and the Paladin hear the commotion and burst in, saving my character and allowing him to live to fight another day.

I'm usually a pretty none confrontational person IRL, especially back then when I was younger, but even then I felt so hurt and frankly offended that he would put my Character In THAT much danger, and for seemingly no reason. Dan, out of character, even asked Jen why he would ever think casting an Illusion to make Me look like rusty Armor would help. But all Jen had to say was that he had a plan, but it didn't work.

Jen is still part of Tod's game, even all these years later, and he hasn't changed much since there. There are over a dozen different occasions where he, seemingly on purpose, fucks me over in game for little to no reason, but these were the first real big moments of it. I just deal with it now, and mostly ignore him, now that we have a much larger and more consistent cast of Players, but I honestly just needed to vent.

Over the last two days, I‚Äôve been trying to think of a way to kill a Tarrasque in one round without using infinite combos (ex. the Simulacrum-Wish combo), and using only unique abilities (i.e. no ability/trait/feature can be used more than once, this does not include spells).

So far, I have a Chronurgist and Diviner using their Convergent Future and Portent abilities when casting Polymorph, respectively, to eat through two of the Tarrasque‚Äôs Legendary Resistances, but that still leaves 1 Legendary Resistance to deal with and one more failure is still needed beyond that to guarantee the Tarrasque is Polymorphed for Power Word: Kill.

I thought about a Sorcerer using their Heightened Spell Metamagic with Polymorph to negate the Tarrasque‚Äôs Magic Resistance, but that still leaves the Tarrasque with a 55% chance of success (assuming 20 Charisma for the Sorcerer).

fqrekt,TalynGray,Looks are deceiving - not all monsters are bad.,"I've been putting off the next session with my kids and really need to get back into it especially now under lock down.
I like to throw a few teaching moments into some sessions and ive got premise that I want some help achieving.
Having just rescued a child and currently in his village being hailed as heroesI want to send the heroes (not sure how yet) off into the forest where they will encounter a massive spider. She will give them a quest and in return they get spider silk which we can make some wraps for the monk with (Spider-Manesk magic item). 

The lesson to be taught is ""not all things ugly/monstrous are your enemy"". 

I need her to be spooky but not evil, how can I convey that? What task does she set? How do our heroes get here?

fqr2et,Luke_EXE123,My D&amp;D Campaign,"This is a D&amp;D story for the Dungeon of the Mad Mage. My group of five players and I took on the challenge at the Yawning Portal for my friend to try out DMing, so we were treating it as a oneshot. The party consists of a human fighter, a dwarf barbarian, a goliath paladin, a half elf wizard, and me, the dragonborn cleric. This is the story of the rise and fall of a curious party in hopes to settle a woman's longing and fill an old woman's obsession for ancient artifacts. Since I played as Frugus the Dragonborn, I figured I should tell the story through his eyes. This is how it goes‚Ä¶

 I find myself in a Tavern enjoying just another drink. When from within the well in the middle of the tavern, adventurers rise out the well and everybody stands up and cheers for them. Everyone is praising them and the whole place is going crazy. To me this looks like a gig that I would want to partake in. I've had very little adventures in my time; however, I want to go and explore the world and battle enemies along the way. I was a soldier from my hometown; however, I was only in one measly fight in which I lost, and from that loss, I now have a permanent scar going down my face. 

As my eyes dart around the room trying to figure out what's happening here.I notice four other adventurers standing up looking just as anxious as me to get into the yawning portal. I, bursting with excitement, run to the well to jump inside. I'm quickly stopped by the humble beernut, the half elf wizard. He looks at me and screams, ‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? That will be a 300 ft fall, you die in an instant if you jump down there!‚Äù The bartender screams out, ‚ÄúEven if you were going to jump down there I won't let you without any missions or a party, Look Around The Tavern and find some, then our humble Goliath will let you down into the yawning portal.‚Äù I start looking around for people to join the party to go fight the quests the people will give to us so that I don't die alone in the well. I find a human, a Goliath, and bearnut the half elf, to bring along on this journey with me; they all seem very eager as well. All we have to do next is find some quests!

We start looking around for a quest, the first person we stumble upon as an old woman. She asks us if we'd be willing to go down the yawning portal and retrieve artifacts for her. The party all at once shouts out, ‚ÄúOf course we'll do that for you along the way, and we will give any artifacts to you for some gold.‚Äù She seems very excited about this and leaves the bar. 

We continue to look around for more quests so that when we return we can get more gold. The next person we find is a crying woman in the corner of the tavern. We asked her if there's anything that we can do for her to ease her sadness. She says that her brother went down to the well and hasn't returned for 2 weeks, she's fairly certain that he's dead at this point; however, any hope that she has leads her to follow us. I step out in front of the group, ‚ÄúWe will gladly help you find your brother. What does he look like and what is your family crest?‚Äù She then proceeded to show us a picture of both. The half-elf stands up, ‚ÄúIt must be hard losing family but we can help you out.‚Äù The whole party starts walking towards the well and the goliath. This goliath operates an elevator to go down to the bottom of the well. We pay him the respected amounts and as I get on the elevator, he looks at us and says, ‚ÄúAre you ready to go? Hop on!‚Äù And before we could even say anything the goliath let go of the Rope sending us into a free fall roughly 300 feet down. Apparently this goliath wasn't very smart. Quickly the wizard cast feather falling so that our legs did not shatter into a million pieces when we hit the ground. We all landed safely. Stepping forward, the human booms, ‚ÄúAll right which way you want to go left or ri‚Ä¶‚Äù He was quickly interrupted by a chicken that appeared right in front of him.

 The goliath that was surviving on one brain cell quickly ran after the chicken, following it down the right path. The party followed. We turned the corner and saw the goliath staring straight up into the ceiling with a feather stuck in the top. I start flipping out. I believe there's some form of trap or enemy nearby. I cast detect magic and detect traps, yet there is nothing there. The half elf gets on the goliath‚Äôs shoulders to reach the chicken's feather. When he touches it, chicken falls from the ceiling knocking the half-elf off of the goliath‚Äôs shoulders to be caught by the human. However, the chicken quickly disappeared. The half-elf rambunctiously or mischievously turned over to me and said, ‚ÄúThat was a pretty good joke right. Casting minor illusion on that goliath really was something funny.‚Äù Both of us laughed and the goliath knew no better; however, I was left on edge. We continue to walk down the hallway. I was leading the way with my ability to cast light. To our right, two of the party members notice that there is a door that wasn't there before. We quickly investigate the room. Slowly entering the room, we are stunned to find three large sculptures and a corpse of a hobgoblin that has obviously been there for a long time. I cast animate dead on the body. We quickly grow a connection with the hobgoblin. He becomes our friend, and even though he's a zombie, we named him Skittles. Skittles has a staff for us that I can repair with mending, so I do. I grasp the staff skittles that are holding in my hands and when I cast mending, the old, rickety wooden staff turns into a beautifully-crafted purple staff with a glistening diamond gem on the end. However, when I repair the staff let out a horrible screech, it alerts all nearby enemies of our location.

From down the dark hallway we hear screaming and shouting from a few men. ‚ÄúI think I heard a noise down there let's go this way!‚Äù Quickly thinking off the top of my head, I use create water in the hallway they were running down. A torrent of water filled the hallway pushing them back into the spears they were wielding, killing all of them immediately. We're safe, for now. We loot them and then continue to walk down the hallway. We came to a room filled with four more men. One of which was a dark elf standing by the door to look out. We quickly kill the look out off using a single blow from a javelin. There are still three more guys sleeping on the ground though. We try to knock two of them unconscious; however, one of them we beat to a pulp rather than knocking him unconscious. No matter how many times we tried, the party couldn't make a high enough strength check to knock him out. However we finally did it. I took the rope I had in my pouch and I tied up the last person with a nat 20, so well that I tied him to the floorboard underneath him through the holes in the floorboard. We investigated the man and he told us that there was something much worse than themselves on the floor. That we were in danger and that we should watch our backs. Despite his ardent warnings and since we were a group on a mission, we continued on.

 After walking down a couple of hallways with very little interaction with NPCs or enemies we come across a large throne room. On the far side of the room there is a large throne made out of bones. In the middle of the room there was a dead dragon surrounded by broken cage parts and shattered crystals. The goliath goes over and sits down on the throne. snakes jump up from underneath the throne and ferociously attack him starting an encounter, however I had no interest in this. Gripped with curiosity, my eyes darted around the room at the dragon and the crystals. I picked up one of the crystals and replaced it with the staff crystal diamond that Skittles gave me. The new gem didn't really change much other than when I cast spells they fired in a single beam. To the right, there was a large barricaded door. We easily broke through to get to the other room. This upcoming event is what the robbers from earlier we're scared of. We open the large door forcefully and we're met by three manticores. At first sight of them, the goliath steps up, dealing tons of damage to the first manticore. I swiftly run up afterwards and pry manticores mouth open with my bare hands. As a copper Dragonborn, I use my breath weapon straight down the manticores throat into his innards, killing him from the inside out. The fight continues. The wizard and I we're staying behind not doing very much other than giving support and health to our allies, while the other two killed the last two manticores with all their might. When the fight was over we found our last party member.

 From within the manticore‚Äôs nest, a dwarf popped out with it a large white bag. We asked him multiple times what was in the bag but he refused to tell us. We inform skittles to go over to the bag and take out what was inside. Nat 20. Inside the bag the dwarf was holding the Deck of Many Things. I immediately draw two cards. My first card allowed me to forget something in my past as if it never happened because it never will have happened. I immediately think back on my past and wish that the encounter I had with the goblin so many years ago never happened so that my face would return to normal. No sooner did I think it did my wish come true, and the scar disappeared from my face. My next card give me proficiency and multiple stats. The human is also excited that we have the Deck of Many Things, he runs over, pushing me out of the way to draw a card. He draws a card that holds the image of a gold key in the flames and in his hands a beautifully-crafted blade falls into his clutches. Astonished, the human looks closely. It is The Nine Lives Stealer, a sword whose story was told through myths and legends. All of us with our new gear continued through the dungeon. 

The next room is large and leads to two hallways that both went to the same room where we would continue on. What we can make out from the dark figure is a large ballisk preoccupied with something else on the other side of the room. I charge in for the first blow. Immediately, I realize that was a mistake. I look the ballisk straight into his eyes and my hands start to turn to stone. Quaking in my boots, I was afraid that this was going to be the end of me. I don't remember what happened next; however, I survived long enough that I could break free from the ballisk‚Äôs curse. I awoke just in time to throw my javelin that I had gotten on my adventures. It was a special javelin. I clutch it in my fists and launch it and it changes into a lightning bolt much like Zeus would throw lightning bolt. I successfully take down the ballisk. Elated, I take a deep breath. My reprieve from worry turns suddenly to desperation. Panic sets in. With my chest pounding, I leap forward, and running with all I have within me, I head to where the lightning struck. My head spins with fear. ‚ÄúNoooo!‚Äù I scream. I scramble. I felt confusion and dismay. What have I done? How irresposnsible to use the Javelin without knowing it worked! I stared at the damage. Dropping to my knees, I cried. My friends had gotten hit in the crossfire. In the process I hit all of my friends (the whole party) in the crossfire, I was unaware how this Javelin of lightning worked. The party had survived the fight and went to go examine the corpse of the ballisk. In the clutches of his hands we found what remains of the woman's brother - a hand with the family's crest on a ring on one of the fingers. There's not much we can do about the woman's brother but at least you're going to get paid now. We move on to. However we will not be moving on much past this point‚Ä¶

 We enter, four statues clearly made out of marble with the fifth being a deep black, almost as black as the endless abyss that is space. When I observed it, I noticed that it had a liquid texture to it. My impulsivity led me to smashing the statue with my mace. As I hit the statue, it catches me. I can't move it's taking in my mace. little did I know, as well as it took me way too long to realize that this was no statue, but rather an ooze monster. The ooze started to crawl up my arms all the way up to my shoulders. My new human friend ran over to me and grabbed me to try and pull me out, he did, but it was the most painful thing that I experienced in my life. The ooze flows off of the statue onto the floor ready to strike. We all take turns throwing blows at it. But nothing is working, with every blow the ooze splits into two copies of itself making itself even more deadly than the last time we had struck. However my next move will not only end my own life but my entire party's lives. For some reason I have the great idea that if we drown it in water, the ooze will dissipate into the water and all will be fine. I was right about the ooze dissipating in the water, however I was not right about the outcome of my actions. I use create water in the room that we are in, filling it to the max. The ooze floats to the top of the water. Unbeknownst to my expectations, it sinks into the water. With its acidic qualities it turns the entire pool of water into a deadly pool of acid. This pool of acid will end the story of this group of adventurers, boiling us all alive, melting the flesh off our bones.

 A big thank you to everybody that read this. I hope you enjoyed it! I just wanted to tell the story of this ‚Äúone shot‚Äù that I played with my friends that I really enjoyed. We plan on playing soon, and hopefully, if it's exciting enough, I can tell you guys the story of our next campaign. Overall I was a little upset that in the end we all died to my own stupidity; however, next time I'll make sure not to be so foolish. This is my first time writing something like this, so hopefully by next time, I will learn more about how to write these types of stories and bring you more tales of my friends and I going on great adventures!",0,1585424860,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqr2et/my_dd_campaign/,DnD,1

fqqswp,TiredPandastic,I need advice. I'm starting to have doubts about my players and it's not fair to them.,"I'm a first time DM, playing on roll20. So far it's been going well but... I think it's beginning to fall apart. I have great players, they're all engaged, they enjoy the game... but I think it's their personal lives that is interfering with the game and causing me a load of distress because I worry about them all so much. 

One of my players (the hexblade) just went through a really rough divorce and he's holding it together, he's recently reconnected with an old flame and I'm pretty sure it's getting serious; I'm genuinely happy for him but he's missed a couple of sessions because he went to hang out with her. 

Another of my players (the barbarian) has an utterly wretched home life with an abusive alcoholic mother and a bunch of financial problems to boot. He's my stablest player, a GM in two games I'm in and a mentor. And yet life keeps kicking him in the ribs every other day and he just sounds so depressed and resigned to his fate. I get distressed and worry about him so much. He almost depends on the game as a means to cheer up. 

The cleric has chronic anxiety issues that completely wreck his sleeping schedule, causing him to be lethargic as hell in game, or nervous and hesitant to engage in terms of roleplay. 

The rogue has a triple whammy of health, mental and stress issues. Her meds recently started giving her some nasty side-effects and it's been affecting her life and ability to focus on the game or even participate. She's an enthusiastic and consistent player on good days but lately bad days have been outnumbering the good ones. I worry about her a lot. 

The druid also has chronic stress problems and does not cope with pressure well at all. He isn't good at taking notes and when it's his turn to do recaps, he can and has fallen apart. He gets pressured at work a lot and just can't cope well. He darn near cries over every little thing that goes wrong. It's hard to 

I am fond of my players but their personal lives' problems are worrying me a lot. Tonight we had to cancel our game just as we were starting because everyone was so out of it. I can tell all of them were frustrated and just... I don't know how to help them. I can't deny that it's disrupting the game and we've talked over and over about their issues and there's just not much I can do. It's killing me and making me feel like my game matters all the more, if it can bring them some joy and relief and escape even for a few hours.",13,1585424010,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqqswp/i_need_advice_im_starting_to_have_doubts_about_my/,DnD,7

I recall it being something related to a demon. During an old 3.5e campaign, a friend had an IRL replica of the dice and I went to look it up later. This was years ago, though, and I can no longer remember the name of this item.

fqpwz1,DefinitelyNotACad,How to gamify animal taming? [5e],"As far as i am aware there are no official rules for taming and training a domesticated or wild creature and therefor i have always somewhat ruled it out of my ass. It... worked i guess but i don't feel comfortable with that anymore especially as i want to create a lot more opportunities for pet companions in my next adventure (in the last a player had expressed interest in building a zoo/animal farm).

But i am sure some smart face out there has already homebrewed a cool ruleset for that. I was thinking about giving the creature a tamed-rating from 1 to 10 (wild and young ones start at 1, already domesticated at a higher rating) and have the player spending rations and having successful roles on intimidation and animal handling on a daily ingame basis before the creature advances a level (and learns a new trick or two). I am just not sure about the details(how many fails/success are required for levling up/down?) and how to punish appropriately if the player is not able to meet the requirements.

I'm running the adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak from the Essentials Kit.

I downloaded the player versions of the maps for the first three quests (Dwarven Excavation, Gnomengarde, and Umbrage Hill) and added them to Roll20. However, when I expand the image to fit the page (using the default page settings), the rooms are much too small to actually place the characters in. I worry about making the page dimensions too large and causing the map to become blurry and unusable, but I can't find segmented versions of the maps online either.

The fist wizard is a 5e class me and my DM came up with.Its a monk,but can use wizard spells,but only in unarmed close-middle range(so for example when using thunder wave you have to punch or punch at the targeted creature, or you have to kick when using scorching ray)it has half the spells and spell slots that a wizard gets and increase by half the amount that a wizard gets during level up(unless the increase is by 1).

They can also use inventions and magic items,for example a mechanical glove that gives them the ability ballista fist(punch the air and fire a mini ballista bolt from glove in direction of punch),a magic glove that causes a shockwave when they punch the ground,or rocket boots  that allow faster movement and harder kicks

For spell casting ability,instead of intelligence strength is used because you have to punch instead of just casting.And it still has the

The do not get anything else from wizard apart from spells and spell slots and the top 3 stats should be dexterity,wisdom(monk) and strength(wizard)

And If anyone is thinking‚ÄùBut how would it cast spells that need magical components‚ÄùIt crushes the required material in its fist or under its foot before the attack

I really want to take the ancestral route, since it can potentially add a lot to a campaign's story, but I can't think of any Shadowfell entities that I can select from. All I can think of are creatures that would steal your soul before they would ever partake in the Bard's request, so to speak ;), or a blessing from the Raven Queen.

Worse still, it's hard to incorporate a Tiefling's fiendish blood into this genealogy without things getting complicated, since I don't think any fiends are related to the Shadowfell. I've thought of Night Hags, but I can't remember if they live on the Shadowfell, or just go there to market in the soul trade.

However with being a keyworker and having a two month old the opportunity to sit down to a formal game on fantasy grounds or roll 20 is quite limited/none existant so I was think of doing a game via Whatsapp.  

The rules would need slimming down obviously and there would be some trust around rolls but I think it could work.  I could send images and maps but the combat would have to be theatre of the mind and probably more roleplaying than combat.   

I was thinking one message for your action in any given situation/combat round (not including rolls which would be as/when asked for) and some actions would be rule of cool rather than rolled (e.g. Can I jump on that running horse? Yeah why not? You're an athletic fighter after all).

* Hit dice format changed, plus two slots given for multiclassing
* Personality traits removed since I don't use them
* Proficiency section includes a 2-column languages list, item proficiencies, combat proficiencies, and other.
 * Combat proficiencies include checkboxes for all the weapon and armor categories.
* Features &amp; traits separated into Passive, Combat, Bonus Actions &amp; Reactions, and Out of Combat
* Exhaustion, inspiration, and sanity added in addition to passive perception and proficiency bonus
* Coins moved to the top of equipment, electrum removed
* Equipment box combined and text boxes labeled for Adventuring Gear and Combat Gear

* Weight and carrying capacity moved
* Each weapon entry is given a line below the statistics to list the weapon or spell traits
* Ammo entries have a separate text box for the maximum value
* Character appearance now has a textbox in addition to the picture

fqp3kf,OtiGoat,Need help with first campeign,"Background/Context
I'm gonna he the DM in my first campeign (5E). It's online, a party I've played with before, original DM will be playing and trusts me.

 The gimick of the Campeign is a death metal rip and tear through hell with bard multiclasses. 

At first I was gonna require all players to be a bard or multi-classing as a bard, but the hit points are doo doo so I've since modified the rules to allow one non multi-classing non bard. Still up for changes though.

The Issue
My main issue is my opening scene. It's an arena battle. I know to change terrain, add objectives, use the crowd, and involve some non combat skills, but the progression I've made seems a bit intense.

Party of four, starting at level 8. Each round has 3 waves. Each wave in a round has the same cr, it just uses higher cr individual enemies.

R1 w1: 5cr1 &amp; 1 cr 2

R1 w2: 2cr2 &amp; 1 cr 3

R1 w3: 1cr3 &amp; 1 cr 4

Each subsequent round starts with a higher collective cr and higher cr monsters. So round 2 has a collective cr of 8 and starts with cr 2 and 3 monsters. I wanted.to do this for three rounds with one round of rest imbetween rounds.

The Cushion:
I added a Deus ex machina in this battle. A giant bass drum with a club suspended abouve it by a rope trick. Cutting the rope and ""dropping the base"" will cast multiple aoe thunder spells and essentially insta kill or incapacitate every monster in the arena for that round. I was also going to use this as a signal for the end of arena combat and the end of the session. The drum will also have smaller regular sized drums on the outside that cast shatter once in the direction they're facing. I feel like all these single charge powerful objects help with the challenging cr.

In addition to the saving pun, there are optional challenges. The last wave can be replaced with a boss challenge of higher cr with higher reward. Round one is one cr 7, round two is one cr 8, etc. Rewards would include a ring of spell storage with a limited number of spells that they can cast stored inside (round one 2 1st level spells or 1 2nd level, round 2 is one 2nd level spell or one 3 Rd, etc.) And 4 health potions.

Finally, I was gonna let the crowd have some influence. Critical hits allow the player to roll performance and rile up the crowd. Depending on the performance check they can receive anything from inspiration up to a giant strength potion thrown at them.

Conclusion:
Did I over do it? Too much content? Too difficult? First time, please criticize away. I'm probably horrible at this anyway so I expect alot of mistakes to be pointed out.

During the final boss (based in the Gaping Dragon from dark souls) the party managed to cut all the beast legs and wings, leting it fall to the ground withouth any posibility to move, then my friend ask me if he can ""do the thing"" , he could, i tell how the beast puts all the strenght that remains in its jaw in an attempt to eat the paladin, who is just next to its mouth, but just before it can close its mouth an enormous c**k descends from the skies cutting the beast in two perfect halves.

fqnm04,pcaramel,The Vanguard (repost),"3.5 homebrew class

The Vanguard is kinda like a slower, tankier barbarian, can use heavy armour and eventually learns how to concentrate the power of a full attack into a single strike.

hit die: d12

BAB: good

BRB:

Fort: good

Ref: bad

Will: bad

class skills: intimidation, climb, craft, spot, listen

Skill points: level one: (2+int mod)x4

Subsequent levels: 2+int mod

Use weapons and armour: A vanguard can use all weapons, armour and Shields except for tower Shields.

Special:

Power attack: a level one Vanguard adquires power attack as a extra feat.

Crushing strike: From level 6 onward a Vanguard upon executing a melee full attack can execute a single extremely powerful strike instead of multiple regular strikes, it Works like a power attack but taking the BAB from every attack roll that comprised the full attack and adding to the damage roll of the first attack (which can be ""personalized"" like your standard power attack) like a power attack the double of this value would be added to a strike with a two handed weapon.

Rage: From level 6 onward a Vanguard can rage like a Barbarian once per day, twice from level 14 onward and thrice from level 18 onward

Damage reduction: from level 7 onward the vanguard adquires 1/- damage reduction, this damage reduction increases by 1 each 3 levels after that.

Launching strike: When a vanguard of level 8 or higher hits a enemy with a crushing strike that enemy is knocked back 5 feet multiplied by the vanguards strenght modifier (-5 feet for each size category that the enemy is bigger than the vanguard, and +5 feet for each size category the target is smaller than the Vanguard) the target also has to make a reflex save (DC: 10 + vanguard, strenght modifier), to avoid being knocked prone.

Stunning strike: When a vanguard of level 11 or higher hits a enemy with a crushing strike that enemy has to make a fortitude save (DC: 10+ vanguard level) to avoid being stunned.

Greater Rage: from level 14 onward the strenght and constitution b√¥nus while enraged increases to +6, while the moral b√¥nus to will checks increases to +3

Unshakable will: While enraged  a Vanguard of level 17 or higher  receives +4 of cumulative b√¥nus to will checks against enchantment spells.

fqnlg8,Dgnslyr,Would like some inspiration for one of my players last games. [Long],"My friend, who recently was discharged from the military, is moving to FL to go to school. He started playing with our friends three years ago and was one of the quiet, not good at roll playing characters (Would take like 2 minutes to make a dialogue decision). He then was deployed to Korea for a year while the group changed campaigns. When he moved back, most of us had moved and live an hour away from him. As a surprise, I had him create a character, drive up, hide in my bedroom until I said an introductory phrase mid game, and he appeared to all of the cheers and hollering from the table. During this past year and a half, he has changed so much and is now a very socially involved player and drives two hours every Sunday to play. He is moving to FL soon and asked to DM a one shot for his last game with us, which I obliged (DMs like to play too). We now have 3 total sessions in 3 weeks to wrap up his story. I would love some help getting me there so that it is memorable.  


Kel is a Fierbolg who's clan lived at the base of Mount Hotenow. Fierbolgs, when they come of age, receive the blessings of Iallanis and become druids to protect the forest. A few weeks after ""The Cataclysm"" struck Neverwinter, Kel went through his right of passage with his childhood friend, the Wood Elf Paladin Prince Arnuanna in attendance. Iallanis didn't bestow her blessings on Kel during his celebration; amidst the whispers and confusion, a large band of lumberjacks savagely attacked the clan. Out numbered and taken by surprise, the group slaughtered the clan, shouting ""SHE IS OUR GODDESS, WE DO THIS FOR HER!!!""   


Arnuanna, takes an arrow to the heart for Kel during the skirmish. Holding his dying friend, he is filled with the rage and might of the Wood Elfs god, Melora. Picking up his friends gear, he blindly rampages through the attackers, saving a young Fierbolg girl from a crazed Dwarf and fights through the night until he passes out. He wakes up in the Wood Elf kingdom under the secret care of the Wood Elf King, who was friends with Kels father, the high Priest who led the celebration and was the first to fall. Kel is informed that he killed the remaining attackers during his blackout, but none of his people survived. For Arnuannas sacrifice, Kel swore to protect the forest as a Paladin of Melora for as long as he lived. The king gifted Kel Arnuannas Elven gear and a magical ring of polymorph that, when attuned, takes one form that the wearer wants; so that Kels heritage can remain a secret. Kel chooses, with the kings blessing, the form of the kings son and takes a new name for public appearances, Kelnuanna.

&amp;#x200B;

What Kel didn't know is that ""The House of Knowledge"" in Neverwinter had sent a band of priests and a priestess to a nearby abandoned temple and asylum after the cataclysm struck. The priestess, a secret leader of an Asmodeus cult and undercover Succubus, was looking for a hidden entrance to an Elven workshop to find a spell that could bind a Primordial, the one in the volcano that caused the cataclysm. Finding out from loggers that a local tribe of Fierbolgs wouldn't allow anyone to desecrate the woods, she used her magic to ""convince"" them that she is a goddess incarnate and they need to kill these beasts so that the mortal races can thrive. Afterwords, she eliminates the leadership of her temple and locks the last remaining priest in the crypts, the human Wizard Atlavast. Under her leadership, she leads the refugees from the cataclysm to the small Hamlet and reestablishes Helms Hold and becomes renown as the Prophet Rohini. 

In the next 40 years, Helms Hold has grown into a large village with it's own private militia to protect the priests, most of whom are undercover succubus and Incubus; and their Prophet, now a high powered Succubus Queen. The Asylum is reopen to help the sick and needy; while secretly corrupting the weak and nonmissable to be footsoldiers for Asmodeus. The mayor of the town is a corrupt puppet under Rohinis control, along with the militia and some of the townsfolk. Knowing the elves would still be a problem, she secretly dispatched a doppleganger to infiltrate the Elven city and report back to Rohini. Due to the death of the kings son and the evil machinations of the doppleganger, the Elves attacks on nearby settlers and contractors escalated to such a degree that the nearby Lords wanted to send an army to deal with them. But, due to the intervention of a ""friendly"" prophets words that the land would drown and die in a sea of blood, then Elves have resigned themselves to a 30 mile stretch of forest, far from where Rohinis miners would be looking for the lost workshop. 

In present time, the adventurers have encountered the friendly prophet on multiple occasions, seeking magical knowledge and defending her Keep from an attacking band of Werewolves, some of which ""escaped."" Recently, while investigating the cult of Asmodeus, they opened up the House of Knowledge and discovered and old and crazed human sorcerer in its depths. The cult became aware of the groups investigation and dispatched assassins to take them out.

Rohini made a visit during a citywide celebration while Atlavast was enjoying the company of an Elf lady that knew him as a boy. This realization that someone could out her led her to dispatch fiends to kill him. During the celebration, an assassin cornered Kel in an alley and demanded to know why he was assuming the form of a fallen comrade. Confused, Kel removed his ring and revealed his true form. The assassin steps out from invisibility to reveal herself as the young Fierbolg girl he saved so many years ago. She reveals that the one responsible for their familys murder must be eliminated and asks for his help, leaving him with her final words, ""To avenge our families, Rohini must die!"" That night, fiends invaded The House of Knowledge and possess Atlavast, causing the group to have to kill him. In the depths of the House, they found paintings of a young priestess that looked like Rohini, but the aging didn't add up. Atlavasts journals uncovered that the Priestess made a journey to look for places to take refugees and the High Priest was angered with her for not telling him about a group of loggers that were killed in the woods during her visit. Knowing she is connected somehow to the night of Kels village massacre, the group sets off to the Elven Kingdom to seek answers from the Elven King, to see if he knows anything about the night of the attack. The night before their journey, a cat that Kel had sent to track the female assassin returned, caked in dried blood.  


I have three sessions to wrap up this story, I am wanting day three to be a 10-12 hour session where they infiltrate Helms Hold and fight the Prophet. I am utilizing the maps found in ""Storm over Neverwinter"" as a basis for the keep, and will be building the map out of foam. It is a ""homebrew"" thats built on the foundation from LMoP and the Neverwinter game/4e book. My remaining ideas that I mulled over for the campaign were..

1. They find that the primordial binding spell is locked in the Waterclock Crypts in Neverwinter.
2. They will need a small army or militia to even think of breeching Helms Holds defenses, but there may be a secret passageway in the asylum.
3. There will be a variety of small fiends, succubus, and Asmodeus enthralled Ugthart werewolves to fight.
4. The Fierbolg assassin warned them about an ambush from previous assassins that almost killed the party. Those assassins are dangerously powerful and could drop two members of the party in the first round if they are not careful. They currently think the assassins killed her for interfering.
5. ""Storm over Neverwinter"" featured an enthralled green dragon fight and the group fought the small one in MoP and it lived with its fleeing words ""You wait till my father hears about this."" I thought about having his dad show up demanding to know where his son is as a ""hook"" and the group finding out about the enthralled young dragon later.
6. As there is only four of them, I wanted to give them a DM PC from the Harpers to help them with the fight.
7. The Primordial spell binding is key to fighting the Big Bad in Gauntylgrim later. The Big Bad gave the Asmodeus cult more power in Neverwinter to help him bind and draw out the power from the primordial. They know of him, and will find out more when the Wizards Tower in Neverwinter reopens.
8. The Doppleganger in the elven kingdom has taken the form of a general and pushes for more viloence against outsiders. He infiltrated years after the massacre and will be completely shocked if he finds out Kel is a surviving Fierbolg, wanting to leave immediately to inform Rohini.
9. The Elven Kingdom is almost 50 miles away will take two days to travel to. If they want to deviate to Kels previous home, it will add an additional day of travel. From the Elven Kingdom to Helms Hold is a three day journey.

We are currently playing 10 hour sessions due to the Corona isolation, so there is a lot of time during the three sessions. I would love any ideas from you all about how to get them to the keep in the next two session.",0,1585413733,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqnlg8/would_like_some_inspiration_for_one_of_my_players/,DnD,1

So wondering if you guys got any recommendations. Preferably if

* No campaign modules ( i am really a big fan of homebrew )
* The more the players focus on roleplaying than messing around the better !
* Humor (tho honestly i have not seen any DnD session that doesn't have it so this is probably nothing to worry ever)
* Also racial roleplaying ! Players don't often focus on this which is a bummer as i want elfs being haughty, tieflings and drows being victims of prejudice and mistrust, aasimars being aasimars are, yuan-ti being malicious etc etc
* 5e tho i don't mind older versions

The Adventures of Dragon Slayer and Metal Club Guy began in a tavern, as many great adventures do. While eating a hearty meal, they overheard some commoners talking about how they saw a strange creature kidnapped and dragged into a crypt on the outskirts of town. By their description, Dragon Slayer and Metal Club Guy knew it was their close friend, Smashy Hammerbear. 

They spent the day hunting game so they could prepare rations. Metal Club Guy managed to get himself a small squirrel, of which there wasn't much left to be eaten. A lesson was learned in hunting small animals with mauls. Dragon Slayer speared himself a wild boar, which meant meat for their upcoming adventure. 

After gathering a few more supplies, the pair headed off to the crypt. They snuck their way down the tunnels until they could hear voices in a room nearby. 

Dragon Slayer crept his way up to the door and carefully began to peek inside. Unfortunately the old door had long ago fallen from its hinges. The door toppled to the ground and two large orcs led by a mysterious man in a wide brimmed hat stood from a table and attacked. 

The companions fought off the orcs, killing one and incapacitating the other. They tackled Evil Hat Man and stole his keys. A stone door in the back of the room was unlocked revealing Smashy Hammerbear! The trio locked Evil Hat Man in his own cell, and questioned the remaining orc, who led them to treasure in exchange for his life. 

Smashy Hammerbear thanked his heroic friends, telling them his brother was a wizard who lived in a tall tower up in the mountains, and promised they could obtain magic powers from him as thanks for their great deed. 

With excitement in their eyes Dragon Slayer and Metal Club Guy looked to the mountains, eagerly anticipating their next great adventure!",8,1585411638,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqmyoi/my_kids_asked_to_play_dnd_for_the_first_time_today/,DnD,1

So I've been slaving over a hot stove all week to cook up the seven tips for players *and* DMs in this video: https://youtu.be/q_K7tfkCDnY 

Check it out ‚Äî I promise it doesn't suck. And if you like what I'm doing, please consider subscribing and leaving a comment. I always appreciate any support :)

But for those who don't like videos, here's my broad points:

1. Plan ahead
2. Roll immediately when asked to
3. Roll attacks and damage together
4. DMs use average damage
5. DMs use Mad Dog Mode (lower HP enemies, higher damage)
6. DMs outsource
7. Skip combat?

And even then, there are some things I hadn't considered when I made the video. For example: how do other RPG systems keep combat moving? 13th Age use a kind of escalation die, where through successive rounds, it gets incrementally easier and easier for attacks to hit. Or in Numenera, the GM doesn't roll, cutting out half the physical labour from the game.

I come here humbly requesting your help. One of my players, a gnome possessed by a bloodthirsty spirit has asked me to designe  her a blood sucking, life stealing weapon. She is a lvl 1sorc/4 Hexeblade warlock and would like to have a mechanic to stay more healthy in fights. As all of my players got a magic item at lvl 5, concerns about powerlevels are not that important. Unfortunately I have no idea how to designe such a weapon, any suggestions would be appritiated.

fqmmpw,Chaosraider98,Need helps making a Fiend Bardlock,"I'm trying to make a Bardlock based off Alastor from the Hazbin Hotel pilot. That kind of character really appeals to me, but I have just a couple of questions:

Should I make Bard my base class, then invest more levels into Warlock, or make Warlock my base class and just dip into Bard? Because I only really want the Bard stuff for the musical flavour (I have a setup that will let me do funny band stuff) but I want to still at least try to optimize.

I plan on making him a Fiend Warlock, what patron would fit the theme? In the end, it's the personality that's very positive, cheery, excitable, but when he's getting serious it'll be raw power and chaos. I'm relatively new to DnD so I'm not sure what patrons would fit (this will also be my first spellcaster).

Thirdly: this won't actually happen, but I like to imagine/create their stories of what they'd do or be like after they hit level 20, long before it happens. What happens if a Warlock kills or dominates their patron?

Secondly, in honor of the excellence that is Doom Eternal, I crafted this artifact as a testament to the strength of the Doom Slayer's Crucible blade, and I plan on offering the players in one of my current D&amp;D 5E campaigns a chance to wield this mighty sword.

Thirdly, please use, modify, or critique this item. I crafted it over several hours listening to Doom's Gate from Mick Gordon's incredible Doom 2016 soundtrack. It is strictly a weapon to punish the wicked, fiends and undead alike, but comes at a cost to the wielder if they do not abide by its crusade.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Slayer‚Äôs Crucible**

*Weapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement by a creature with martial weapon proficiency)*

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of the Blood War, his soul blistered by the fires of the Nine Hells and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the plains of Avernus seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the elves, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of the Nine Hells, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the soldiers of the Abyssal lords and the Archdevils with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but devil had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the angel Zariel bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the adamantine pillars of Bel‚Äôs temple. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the Nine Hells and the infinite Abyss. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realms.

The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the archives of Maladomini across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons and the devils. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the Abyss rose Demogorgon, the Sibilant Beast, the Prince of Demons, a champion mightier than all who had come before, a titan of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon Avernus and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. Demogorgon fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the titan, and in his defeat the demon horde was routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer with a mighty weapon, wrought in the forges of Dispater, unbreakable and unyielding. With this sword of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void.

Yet as the mighty Demogorgon fell and dread engulfed the armies of the Nine Hells and the Abyss, Asmodeus laid a trap to capture this scourge of Avernus. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Prince of Demons, the Hell Walker sought prey in the halls of Bel‚Äôs Flying Fortress. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the fortress upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all the Nine Hells that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.

**Magic Weapon.** The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* appears as a greatsword hilt forged of adamantine. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of infernal magic to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic Greatsword has the two-handed property. If you are proficient with greatswords, you are proficient with the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible*.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.

**Properties.** The greatsword has the following properties:

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you can‚Äôt be charmed or frightened.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you can speak, read, and write Infernal and Abyssal.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you have resistance against fire damage.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

¬∑ When you hit with a weapon attack while attuned to the artifact, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.

¬∑ While you are attuned to the artifact, your alignment becomes chaotic good.

¬∑ While you are attuned to the artifact, creatures of the fiend or undead type are always hostile towards you.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you lose the ability to speak.

**New Personality.** While attuned to the artifact, you gain a new character flaw. This trait overrides any conflicting flaw. 

‚ÄúI allow nothing to stand in the way of my crusade to eradicate evil from the multiverse.‚Äù

**Spirit of the Doom Slayer.** While the sword is on your person, you add a d6 to your initiative at the start of every combat. If the sword doesn‚Äôt attempt to devour the soul of every undead and fiend it encounters, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 8d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the *dominate monster* spell, and the sword demands that it slay any fiend and undead in sight. The spell effect ends when the sword‚Äôs demand is met.

**Devil‚Äôs Sight.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wielding this weapon increases its range by 60 feet. Magical darkness does not impede your darkvision. 

**Glory Kill.** Whenever you use it to reduce a fiend or undead to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul. A creature whose soul has been devoured by the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* can be restored to life only by a *wish* spell.

When it devours a soul, the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* grants you temporary hit points equal to your character level. These hit points fade after 24 hours.

**Sentience.** The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, driving the wielder into a rage when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through hellish nightmares, when the wielder is asleep.

**Personality.** The sword‚Äôs purpose is to bring ruin to fiends and undead. Killing these creatures, destroying their works, and foiling their machinations all help to fulfill this goal. 

The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* also seeks to destroy anyone in service to devils, demons, or the undead. The sword‚Äôs obsession with its goals eventually becomes a fixation of its wielder. 

**Destroying the Sword.** The only way to destroy the sword is to melt it down in the forge of Dispater where is was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",5,1585409400,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqm9rh/homebrew_magic_item_the_slayers_crucible/,DnD,1

I am about to play in a campaign in the Wildemount setting and we are making characters using the new Heroic Chronicle system. I am a little bit confused by the Social Status Relationships table though.

In the step above social status you roll a d20 to determine your background, then the next table is your social status which also has a table for rolling a d20, however it has backgrounds next to all of those d20 results. Are you only rolling once and that determines both your background and your social status? are you supposed to change your background based on your social status roll? Is there any point to having the D20 table on the social status at all? Am I missing some very obvious  thing?

My DM is scratching his head as well so if we can give the rest of the players a good answer before they are in the weeds of character creation that would be a good thing.

fqk54f,pcaramel,The Vanguard,"3.5 homebrew class

The Vanguard is kinda like a slower, tankier barbarian, can use heavy armour and eventually learns how to concentrate the power of a full attack into a single strike.

hit die: d12

BAB: good

BRB:

Fort: good

Ref: bad

Will: bad

class skills: intimidation, climb, craft, spot, listen

Skill points: level one: (2+int mod)x4

Subsequent levels: 2+int mod

Use weapons and armour: A vanguard can use all weapons, armour and Shields except for tower Shields.

Special:

Power attack: a level one Vanguard adquires power attack as a extra feat.

Crushing strike: From level 6 onward a Vanguard upon executing a melee full attack can execute a single extremely powerful strike instead of multiple regular strikes, it Works like a power attack but taking the BAB from every attack roll that comprised the full attack and adding to the damage roll of the first attack (which can be ""personalized"" like your standard power attack) like a power attack the double of this value would be added to a strike with a two handed weapon.

Rage: From level 6 onward a Vanguard can rage like a Barbarian once per day, twice from level 14 onward and thrice from level 18 onward

Damage reduction: from level 7 onward the vanguard adquires 1/- damage reduction, this damage reduction increases by 1 each 3 levels after that.

Launching strike: When a vanguard of level 8 or higher hits a enemy with a crushing strike that enemy is knocked back 5 feet multiplied by the vanguards strenght modifier (-5 feet for each size category that the enemy is bigger than the vanguard, and +5 feet for each size category the target is smaller than the Vanguard) the target also has to make a reflex save (DC: 10 + vanguard, strenght modifier), to avoid being knocked prone.

Stunning strike: When a vanguard of level 11 or higher hits a enemy with a crushing strike that enemy has to make a fortitude save (DC: 10+ vanguard level) to avoid being stunned.

Greater Rage: from level 14 onward the strenght and constitution b√¥nus while enraged increases to +6, while the moral b√¥nus to will checks increases to +3

Unshakable will: While enraged  a Vanguard of level 17 or higher  receives +4 of cumulative b√¥nus to will checks against enchantment spells.

Tireless Rage: from level 20 onward a vanguard is no longer exhausted after the end of their rage.

fqjqkg,HereticIronWarrior,"Anyone got any *real* bad pet peeves, as a DM, or a player, that they cant stop people from doing.","I know I have. My bad one, as a DM, is when the players are doing something, they need to solve something, when they want to do something, they will literally ask ""can I make a [check] check]"" now this is alright with perception and insight, however when they want to, say, persuade someone to do something, they say 'can I make a persuasion check' with no context! I will usually ask them what they say, but it still annoys me. I like them to do something, and then me say: ""ok, make a [check] check"", because this gives me the freedom of weather they need to make the check or not, or if I just tell them. It also takes away from immersion. Furthermore, when I'm playing (same group) I will try to do something, and unless I ask for an ability check, our DM will *never* get me to do a check, not even basing stuff on our skills.

fqj6o6,Doomwaffel,Creating a 1vs1 (Lv19) duel encounter for a melee [3.5e DM + homebrew],"Hello everyone,  
I am running a long 3.5e campaign in a Dragonlance setting. One of my players is what you could describe as a very strong Minotaur paladin/fighter of an evil god (Lv19). After he gravely offended his god once, he got punished and now has to prove his strength again. His god is leading him to a lonely place deep in a glacier, below which a lake of magma boils around an island. There he will find the former champion of his god, who also fell from grace and was cast into a golem-like form, bound to that place until a true warrior defeats him in battle.

I took heavy inspiration from a certain Samurai Jack episode there. \^\^   
After defeated he will grant him the weapon of his deity. Something he was supposed to get earlier, but he f\*cked up the last trial. \^\^   


The players character is a pure heavy hitter with a +5 weapon (thanks to our wizard)  
His deity is about strength, revenge, fire. I assume the PC would be buffed by his group first.  
It doesn't have to be a literal golem, an undying (not undead) warrior in armor would also work. Or anything else that is just reskinned for the purpose. But I need something to start this off from. Something from 3.5 or PF can be used and altered.

There are plenty of ideas one could use, the important part is that this is supposed to be a 1 on 1 fight, so what sort of CR should be appropriate for this? It should be challenging but not impossible.   


Maybe an optional win condition like winning 3 grapple checks to pull him into the lava? The PC is very good at that.

I was checking a CR16 (PF) Mithral golem, but that looks very strong as is. A CR16 flesh colossus has some cool abilities, but I would scale his size down - he could fall apart once, giving the PC a chance to do dmg to his parts. A bit video game-ish but it might work.  
Maybe an advanced fire giant might be cool.

I wanna make a whole pokemon team for Sean based on the 6 summon spells the wizard gets, Fiend / Aberrant / Elemental / Fey / Shadow / Undead. I figured it would be good for him to have one pokemon for each variant for each spell, basically so he can have a team he swaps out and such.

Monks: the party is without any of their standard adventuring equipment (weapons, armour, spell books and focuses) and you need to fight without your gear.

Bards: (assuming a musical bard) a musical battle likely with another bard of some sort.

Rogues: a heist probably.

I know that these won't be perfect for every character with these classes and that's before even thinking about multi classing, but I think this might help people (or at least me) to understand the appeal of each class archetype (beyond mechanical power)",17,1585393363,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqi3em/what_are_the_must_include_opportunities_for_each/,DnD,1

We are currently playing rise of tiamat and my dungeon master has asked to make a few ties to the campaign in our backstory.
xigella from a village in the moonshale isles which are islands set kind of far off from the swordcoast. I'm playing as a bloodhunter with a profane soul pact and I'm pretty sure my patron is tiamat or some sort of powerful blue wyrmling that is important to the story still not completely sure. However as a child an agent of tiamat had cursed him as my character out of fear stabbed him somewhat unprovoked and killed him. This curse causes xigella to hear voices inside his head and on occasion hallucinate. Growing up xigella was very secluded from the rest of the village. A man named mauk had helped xigella learn the swordsmanship of a bloodhunter and how to meditate to keep the curse somewhat at bay. Eventually the curse took over when mauk had left the village making xigella a sort of sleeper agent afterwards xigella murdered the village chiefs father and a servant. When xigella was discovered he was thrown in a cell for a year until mauk came back and convinced the chief to exile xigella instead. Mauk brought xigella to the bloodhunter order and taught him there. The bloodhunter order is located in a cave inside the mountains by the snakewood. Eventually as xigella finished the training the order threw him through a portal leading to the arctic tundra outside of the glimmerwood in which xigella survived with a small dragonborn tribe in which he learned draconic. Eventually he made his way adventuring to waterdeep and the campaign began. His mother is also an adventurer and whereabouts are unsure of her but his father was with him for his childhood.

ANWAAAAAAAY, what subclass do you guys recommend? I was torn between a battlesmith and an artillerist, then I chose battlesmith. Now I dont even know, the battlesmith just seems so, lackluster. Dont say ""whatever you feel like playing"" or ""Whatever is the funnest"" cause I dont know the answer to that, I'd like to know, for my party (Mystic, arcane archer(fighter), Samurai(Fighter), Paladin and a life domain cleric) what would be my best option for this party, or if youve played multiple before, what is the funnest/most enjoyable? Also the alchemist is there but unless you think that blows the others out of the water in regards to my party, dont say it.

I'm a newbie in Ttrpg such as DnD, i'been interested in it for a long time, but just a while ago i was able to find a group (as ttrpgs aren't really common where i live), sadly, coronavirus attacked, so its gonna be a while till we can play.

Anyway, i need some tips or suggestions for a character i want to use.
We will use the ""Rise of the dragon/Resurgir del dragon"" module, and i want to use one of the races there, called ""Viperos"" something similar to a Yuan ti.
He's gonna be a rogue, but i want to multiclass into a warlock later on, in the sheet, when i was rolling the dice to get some traits i got the ""I stole a cursed artifact, and the curse is still on me today"" (or something like that, sorry, my english its not really good)
so i thought ""Hey, maybe the cursed artifact was inhabited by some short of being, or its a fragment of one, so i make a contract with it later on""

there's a kind of patron called Pilgrims/peregrinos, that actually fit on that, but i will ask anyway if there's something better.

so, the idea was (to give it some extra spice), that being was in need of/Wants a body, and whatever the contract will be, he actually wants to steal my Pjs body. But i need some way to make it work, my DM and i were thinking about things like:

‚Ä¢Every warlock level i have to make an (not decided yet) saving throw or the curse will grow/expand

‚Ä¢ i have to make that throw everytime i use my warlock spells/cantrips

and i also need to think about some advantage to accompany this, to make it a hight risk, hight reward kind of thing.",5,1585391354,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqhmqf/new_dnd_player_looking_for_some_tips/,DnD,1

A short time later we get an encounter that was challenging, felt significant, and most importantly was fun. It led to PCs getting to know each other better as a group, learn something about their fellow adventurers and their personalities. Plus, we got to kick undead ass. The story continued and a situation presented itself. It seemed almost like an inevitable combat encounter. Except one player was in favor of a peaceful resolution, and the others had good and justified reasons to want to fight: revenge. The diplomatic route led to finding more about the lore of the world in an organic and extremely interesting way. It also resulted in great RP between the party, and there's good distrust and tension between two PCs now. The session ended there, with a purposeful way ahead. And next session is in a few days.

fqgqkd,Holdiniful,My players commented on my progress as a DM and I‚Äôm ecstatic.,"We just finished session 52 the other night and for the first time to my memory my players collectively talked about my DM‚Äôing after the session. 

This campaign I‚Äôve been running is my first ever, and boy has it been a ride. 

I had been a player for at least a few months and had a pretty decent understanding of the game, but I had only DM‚Äôd a few one-offs. I was inspired by a campaign I‚Äôd been watching on Twitch and I started creating an entire homebrew continent, got some friends together to play, and took off.

I‚Äôve made so so so many mistakes that I look back on and cringe at now. Didn‚Äôt vet the PC‚Äôs very well, didn‚Äôt run a session zero, later didn‚Äôt handle the first PC death well, nor did I handle the aftermath well. I often mixed up or forgot NPC voices and accents, the story was a little all over the place, it was a lot. 

It gets even better knowing I‚Äôve been streaming the whole campaign from session one, literally broadcasting my mistakes to the world. Meanwhile I‚Äôve also been uploading each session to YouTube, so my growth and mistakes are on the internet forever. 

But the other night one of my players commented something along the lines of ‚Äúyou know, you‚Äôve gotten a lot better at DM‚Äôing throughout the campaign‚Äù and the rest of the players joined in. 

And for the first time ever, my players prompted me to squeeze in an extra session tomorrow because they really want to see what happens next. 

I‚Äôve never been more motivated to create an awesome experience for my players. 

Let this be a reminder to players, if you enjoyed your session SAY SOMETHING. You never know how much one compliment can validate hours of work for the person who just ran your game.",8,1585386870,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqgqkd/my_players_commented_on_my_progress_as_a_dm_and/,DnD,1

&gt; Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. **If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.**

Note that it counts as 1 Magic item for the sake of Attunement slots, and not as 1 magic item overall.

Soul of Artifice
&gt; At 20th level, you develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:
You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws **per magic item you are currently attuned to.**

Note that it says Per Magic item, and not, per attunement slot filled.

Which means, each Magic Tattoo you posess, while them all combined only taking up 1 attunement slot, each one counts as a +1 towards your saving throws in themselves.

Which, potentially, if you have EVERY spell tattoo, and every 6 artificer attunement slots filled.
A grand total of +25 to his saving throws.

More realistically however, it‚Äôs possible to add a potential +2 or +3 more to the saving throws, ending up with a +9 to everything.",26,1585386600,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqgoqt/new_spell_tattoo_ua_breaks_late_game_artificer/,DnD,1
fqgjfq,Ovidiu_J,Kicking players out of a campaign,"I find myself faced with a really tough decision. 

I have a group of 5 players, the make-up is something like this: 

\- 1 player who's really into RPGs and plays it as such 

\- 1 player who's new to DnD &amp; RPGs, but really tries his best. He's shy, but whenever he does contribute he's really in character and in theme. (he even made an awesome accent out of the gate and stuck with it) 

\- 1 experienced player, who takes the game seriously and know how to approach situations

\- 2 players who know a bit about DnD, but they have this thing I think of as the 'anime hero complex'. In all encounters, they have this over-the-top, we-could-kill-everyone-if-we-wanted-to attitude. They speak more and louder than the other three and often take the discussion way out of the campaign (talk about memes moments remind them off, say random/aggressive things just to see how NPCs would react and don't care much about the story ‚Äî whenever they derail it and one of them realizes he's gone too far and apologizes, the other one goes ""don't worry about it man, I'm having a great time."" 

I can feel the others and myself try to immerse ourselves in the narrative and encounters. But it's like watching a really good movie and your roommate keeps poking his head through your door asking if you random stuff or sticking memes in your face (it takes you out of the immersion completely). 

I had a moment last session when I snapped. I'm felt really bad for it afterward, but the situation went something like this ‚Äî I was introducing a new NPC and the encounter with him was a pivotal point to the story. I spent all week thinking about this encounter, wrote pages on notes and ideas to make it a powerful moment. And they stopped the dialogue after every single line, going off into random directions outside of the game. I was rifling through my notes figuring out what to use, and I swear, I kept forgetting what I was looking for because of their discussion. And I told them ""Guys, when you keep breaking the dialogue to talk bullshit it really takes me out of it and I can't focus on this."" I was a bit harsh, but even so, they went back to it half an hour later. And the moment didn't land at all. I was genuinely frustrated, not because I wanted it to go a certain way, but because I worked so hard to make it good and it was dead in the water because no one could focus on the conversation. 

Anyway, I've kinda already made my mind up ‚Äî I'll kick them out of this campaign (which is not easy, one of them is one of my best friends from back in high school and he's really into this campaign). I'll offer to run something just for the two of them separately. Something built to be over-the-top so their style will fit the world, and let the other three players and myself enjoy the other campaign. 

I needed to vent a bit (sorry for the rant), and get your thoughts on this ‚Äî how would you handle this? (I tried talking to them about it many times, but it never sticks for more than a few hours)",5,1585385820,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqgjfq/kicking_players_out_of_a_campaign/,DnD,1

fqgain,Mortos7,West Marches Ravnica Server,"5th Edition Ravnica Discord Server \[Online\]\[West Marches\]\[5e\]\[D&amp;D\]\[Discord\]

Greetings, everyone! I am looking for DMs, Loremasters, and players for a West Marches-style Ravnica, City of Guilds campaign. Loremasters (LMs) are those who wish to assist in the creative process, but do not want to run games like DMs. The city of Ravnica has ten guilds with each acting similarly to a West Marches town and there are countless layers to the ever-expanding city.

All are welcome, as new players can be taught and roleplayers will enhance that feeling of a living, breathing city. Recruitment will always be open. Please note this is all very experimental and is always subject to improvement. It is a massive undertaking, but I hope with everyone we can make it an amazing experience!

West Marches involves players beginning in (and always going returning to) a starter town. Players partake in shaping the town, organizing parties themselves (primarily because of scheduling, but also for in-game reasons), and exploring more difficult challenges the farther from town. Of course, I adapted West Marches to Ravnica. Players advance in renown in Guilds, have to deal with the other Guilds, and there is always something new in Ravnica. The playstyle is sandbox and open world in a sense. There is no set schedule as the players will form parties themselves, preferably with their guild members. DMs will also post sessions whenever they are available.

The sessions will utilize Discord for global communications. Players can always roleplay in designated roleplaying channels. Sessions may require voice chat or allow only text chat depending on the GM. Most players will be using Theatre of the Mind and GMs are welcome to use VTTs and other aids as they prefer.

This is the Discord Server we will be using. There are currently three campaigns being hosted: Ravnica, Sliders (MTG planehopping), and a Skyrim campaign. Members are always welcome to host campaigns and oneshots in the server. Feel free to contact me for any assistance you may need! Thank you!

Note: While we are always looking for more members of every kind, we are in particular need of DMs to run sessions, and there is an abundance of players to work with!

I've been having a conundrum lately, I always seem to play more happy/neutral characters in my D&amp;D groups, but lately I've been craving something darker. A character who actually had a tragic past, where bad things happend and it made him more jaded, mysterious, and... well... darker. Buy everytime I've ever tried attempting to make somthing like this in the past I've almost always either A.) Defaulted back to being happy or neutral making my character boring. Or B.) Created a self-vomit inducing edgelord trainwreck that I hated playing every second of. 

So my question is this, ""How do I create a darker and more mysterious character without falling into all of those terrible edgey trobes/stigmas?"" I want to play a character you can feel for and sympathize with, while also not completely ignoring the tragedy and sorrow he's experienced in his life.  A character that's not your stereotypical happy ho lucky white boy protagonist or a faceless no-nothing wall flower.

The ‚ÄúElder Scrolls‚Äù way is to have your players introduced to a very general overview of the main details of what has happened and what is going on in your world, and let them do whatever they want from there.

The ‚ÄúWitcher‚Äù way is to have an obvious ‚Äúmain storyline‚Äù for players to follow, but they can also do side quests and still have the option of doing whatever they want (but eventually they‚Äôll have to back-track).

fqegad,Ser_Vett,Caravan as a Hub Town?,"So, I'm working on a campaign setting where the players are going to be a handful of professional Monster Hunters who travel with a Caravan led by a retired Dragon Hunter and his daughter who will buy and/or break down monsters into resources for them (Nothing too deep, just a system of converting dead monster's HD into a resource based on the creature's type that can be spent to lower the cost of crafting items/making food/replacing expensive material components- not the focus.)  


&amp;#x200B;

 The story is the Monster Hunting is kind of a side gig for the caravan as a whole on it's Year+ journey from a coastal human metropolis to a massive Dwarven Citadel out in the desserts.  The caravan itself will stop for weeks or months at a time to resupply, buy/sell merchandise, collect adventure hooks, and all that.  I'm pretty much set on the adventure hooks themselves, I'm just struggling with how much of a Hub town the caravan itself will be.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I could provide an exhaustive but basic list of goods and supplies from the players handbook, plus certain magical or religious resources, but then would the players have any reason to want to check out any of the towns, or care about what's happening at the Inn?  Or how is the traveling smith stocking Platemail when most of his wagon space belongs to a clunky forge?  


 

So far what I have for the npcs (not including hired guards/as of yet unfleshed out hangers on's) are  
\-The Leader/His daughter: They turn the monster corpses into loot.

\-The smith: mostly focused on keeping the horses/oxen shoed but also sells weapons and armor (considering making this into players can COMMISSION gear from him, which he may not be able to finish in a single stop)

\-The Mage: can cast from their list of 0-4th level spells for a fee, sells special paper/ink/scrolls/material components.

\-The Friar: Basically the Mage but for divine casters, not really a merchant himself but follows a god of travel.

\-The plucky general store duo: Sells all sorts of adventuring gear.  (Not sure if I want to limit their stock or not?  One idea I had was they only sell their stuff by the 'pack', so like Explorers pack, Dungeoneers pack, ect.  But leave out diplomat/scholar pack to make those items harder to come by?  Idk)

\-The Camp Followers: One idea I had for if the hub was too good to shop anywhere else, just have one facet of the caravan be folks asking the heroes to go on a beer run, where they could run into some in-town hooks and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever done anything like this before?  Got any insight to share?  Can I really call it a ""hub"" if I'm not making everything they might want available?  Or if not, are my proposed limitations good, or not going far enough?",2,1585374914,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqegad/caravan_as_a_hub_town/,DnD,1

**Slayer‚Äôs Crucible**

*Weapon (greatsword), artifact (requires attunement by a creature with martial weapon proficiency)*

In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of the Blood War, his soul blistered by the fires of the Nine Hells and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the plains of Avernus seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the elves, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.

Tempered by the fires of the Nine Hells, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the soldiers of the Abyssal lords and the Archdevils with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but devil had before.

And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the angel Zariel bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the adamantine pillars of Bel‚Äôs temple. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the Nine Hells and the infinite Abyss. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the dark realms.

The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the archives of Maladomini across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons and the devils. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.

None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the Abyss rose Demogorgon, the Sibilant Beast, the Prince of Demons, a champion mightier than all who had come before, a titan of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon Avernus and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. Demogorgon fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the titan, and in his defeat the demon horde was routed.

And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer with a mighty weapon, wrought in the forges of Dispater, unbreakable and unyielding. With this sword of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void.

Yet as the mighty Demogorgon fell and dread engulfed the armies of the Nine Hells and the Abyss, Asmodeus laid a trap to capture this scourge of Avernus. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Prince of Demons, the Hell Walker sought prey in the halls of Bel‚Äôs Flying Fortress. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the fortress upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all the Nine Hells that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.

**Magic Weapon.** The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* appears as a greatsword hilt forged of adamantine. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of infernal magic to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic Greatsword has the two-handed property. If you are proficient with greatswords, you are proficient with the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible*.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.

**Properties.** The greatsword has the following properties:

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you can‚Äôt be charmed or frightened.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you can speak, read, and write Infernal and Abyssal.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you have resistance against fire damage.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

¬∑ When you hit with a weapon attack while attuned to the artifact, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.

¬∑ While you are attuned to the artifact, your alignment becomes chaotic good.

¬∑ While you are attuned to the artifact, creatures of the fiend or undead type are always hostile towards you.

¬∑ While attuned to the artifact, you lose the ability to speak.

**New Personality.** While attuned to the artifact, you gain a new character flaw. This trait overrides any conflicting flaw. 

‚ÄúI allow nothing to stand in the way of my crusade to eradicate evil from the multiverse.‚Äù

**Spirit of the Doom Slayer.** While the sword is on your person, you add a d6 to your initiative at the start of every combat.

**Devil‚Äôs Sight.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wielding this weapon increases its range by 60 feet. Magical darkness does not impede your darkvision. 

**Glory Kill.** Whenever you use it to reduce a fiend or undead to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul. A creature whose soul has been devoured by the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* can be restored to life only by a *wish* spell.

When it devours a soul, the *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* grants you temporary hit points equal to your character level. These hit points fade after 24 hours.

**Sentience.** The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, driving the wielder into a rage when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through hellish nightmares, when the wielder is asleep.

**Personality.** The sword‚Äôs purpose is to bring ruin to fiends and undead. Killing these creatures, destroying their works, and foiling their machinations all help to fulfill this goal. 

The *Slayer‚Äôs Crucible* also seeks to destroy anyone in service to devils, demons, or the undead. The sword‚Äôs obsession with its goals eventually becomes a fixation of its wielder. 

**Destroying the Sword.** The only way to destroy the sword is to melt it down in the forge of Dispater where is was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",1,1585374338,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqebz0/magic_item_artifact_slayers_crucible/,DnD,1

fqe05n,kubbyzz,Can other classes use Wizard spellbooks?,"I had a D&amp;D campaign not too long ago, and I had a DM allow a Sorcerer to use a copy of a Wizard's spellbook we got off of one of the NPCs. He allowed him to use all the spells in that Spellbook without any preparation or whatever. I'm having trouble finding a clear answer to this that includes a true explanation and would like to show it to my DM if need-be.  
I believe that the only class that should be able to use spellbooks are Wizards, due to how they learned their magic through ""scholarly study."" It seems wrong to me that any old spellcaster can pick up a spellbook and be able to use it when most other classes just ""know"" spells. Also, I remember vaguely reading somewhere that the only person who can understand a wizard's spellbook IS the Wizard himself or herself due to how the notes are supposed to be written in a way only that wizard can understand, and as such, no other class can learn spells through that same method; and especially in this case, as said before, Wizard being the only class that learns spells through ""study."" Am I wrong in assuming this? Wizards learn spells in a way entirely separate from other spellcasters I only thought about this until after the campaign, in which these two members (the Sorcerer and the DM's character playing in the party) betrayed us by turning us over to the BBEG and the campaign ended.  
I would like some clarification if I'm right and this and why. Thanks!  
P.S. I don't like how the DM incorporated one of his characters in the party. It felt like he could sway the campaign too easily in which way his character wanted, i.e. betraying us with his character siding with the BBEG, due to controlling a main character AND all the enemies, especially the BBEG.

I‚Äôm mainly knowledgeable in the world of Final Fantasy but I wanted to make a class that‚Äôs focused on cleric/summoning since my first FF game was FFX where there‚Äôs a job for some people to take that usually being a summoner to defeat a being named Sin whom would appear every 10 years to wreck havoc in their world. The summoner job was to go to temples and pray to get the help of classic FF summons as well as new ones to fit the worlds theme only to then obtain the last summon to kill the being. ( I would go on but it be spoilers at that point ). The many sub jobs of summoners are dependent on what the person did before being one like a sports player, a knight, or a priest. Mainly why I asked for a cleric/summoner class is based on my play style as I choose to be a healer based characters if there is one in a game, and a summoner because I just like the sound of evoking a being from another world.

Name: Theft Protection
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Time: 10 min
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (Gem worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes, and a golden key worth at least 150 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
Classes: Artificer, Wizard

You create a protective shield among any belonging no larger than a 5 foot cube that can be opened or contain materials such as a book, bag, or a chest. 

Any creature attempting to open the object that was not designated by the caster when the spell was cast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be forced to return the object to the caster or any creature designated by the caster to receive the object when the spell is cast. The target innately knows the direction of whom to bring the object and continues to the best of their ability to return the item for a duration of 24 hours.

Once the spell is used in this way the spell it is dispelled and must be recast on the object.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 5th-level spell slot, the Duration is 10 days. When you use a 7-level spell slot, the Duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the saving throw is made at disadvantage and the Duration is a year and a day.",1,1585368420,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqd00w/homebrew_spell_requesting_balance/,DnD,1

fqcvvq,tebdbfhfjrnrhh,Issue with Cleric,"Hey, gamers!

In short, I'm pretty new to 5e (but I'm more familiar with 3/3.5e) and I feel pretty frustrated by my Cleric character.

I just don't get the right feel I'm after for a 5e cleric: thematically and mechanically.

I recently ""audited"" 5e for a better understanding of my specific issues with the class. I've read that Cleric is a great 'utility' class, so they can fill nearly any niche of gameplay. Clerics can sub for any other class, I think, but they stand up poorly on their own. 

Thematically, I feel that the cleric 'genre' is better fielded by druids or warlocks. Mechanically I feel that wizard or, especially, sorcerer makes more sense for a cleric character.

Basically, I'm feeling that the cleric class makes for bad clerics, and I'm at a loss for how to fix that.

Simple fix would be to go arcana domain cleric to get those awesome high level spells (cleric high level spells suck) and while that, mechanically, fills that gap the sacrifice of character fidelity feels too big a loss. I don't want to be a wizard-wannabe-cleric, but that feels like the cleared solution.

What I'm thinking of is some kind of revision to divine intervention: as a thematic ability it is awesome, but in practice I've found it to be a total damp rag= not worththeaction it takes to cast at a 90% chance of failure and no direction about what happens *if* I succeed. I'm better off just using a spell at that point.

As I said, I don't have *that much experience, any ideas guys?",9,1585367952,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqcvvq/issue_with_cleric/,DnD,1

* You can easily insert any image and token from the web itself using the built in Insert Bing search
* You can then move, resize, copy, paste it so one goblin can be copied and moved as often as desired.
   * I am using a seperate whiteboard as a 'library' of cool tokens, images
* have graph paper as the background
* You can sketch in rough trees. streams, walls, rocks, quickly (and in my case- badly)
* You can insert a battlemap, set it as background and drag the images onto it
* You can share the whiteboard with anyone so they can be involved in drawing and inserting items as well.
* You can prep the whiteboards before hand or draw them on the fly
* shrink way back or zoom way in

fqcski,Questgiver392,I think my DM made an encounter I couldn't win. Is it normal?,"A friend told me to post on reddit. Sorry if I'm breaking any of the rules.

I read the books like crazy when I started and have DM some games. I look up monsters when I see them used on Critical Role. I even make my own monsters and use monsters in the books as a base. My memory is pretty good with rules and monsters.

I have been using monsters from some books, official and 3rd party, to base off some monsters for my campaign and came across a monster I'm 99% sure the DM used on me last session. And I'm only sure of this because of some specific abilities it used and an ability the DM told me it had afterwards which is super specific. I found this by accident and didn't realize it till I made it to the abilities.

I have no problems with monsters being adjusted to challenge the players. I know this DM has adjusted monsters before. Especially since my DM picks monsters and makes adjustments on the fly. But these adjustments seem like the were purely to make sure I lose (and I'm sure this has happened before with a giant). This was a 1 v 1 surprise fight. We are tier 4 characters.

The monsters AC was raised by 3 to 22. And I know I did more than enough damage to kill it. Even if it was given an extra 100 hp. And when I asked the DM how close it was to death after the session they said it was a little below half. Which means it had 400 something hit points at least. Nearly 200 over its normal.

The big thing is that it beat me in a shove check that I'm 99% sure was staged now. Like I wasn't supposed to win. The creature only has a +5 normally and not proficient. I am proficient with expertise and got in the mid 30s. It still beat me and ended the encounter due to something it did.

When telling a friend about the session they brought up that most monsters don't have super high numbers in that stat. So it was weird that I lost it. I brushed it off at the time.

But this isn't the first time a monster has been adjusted with HP 100 to 200 above its maximum. It happened with a hill giant before. I try to play my characters smart with some strategy. I spent a long time picking off that giant from range and it didn't die. I tried to kill the recent monster with some strategy but it ultimately didn't work and turned into a slug fest. But I tried to do everything I could to hit and add some damage. Rage, reckless attack, GWM on and off, sentinel set up, action surge, second wind, etc. I try to play smart and I know you don't always win. The AC and HP are one thing. But that shove check is bothering me.

I'm 99% sure that the DM made it so I wouldn't win that encounter. I had my suspicions after the session. But now I'm almost completely sure. If I have no chance of winning from things being changed on the fly, then what am I supposed to do?

I feel bad for finding the monster and wish I didn't. I already suspected I wasn't supposed to beat it. Is changing monsters that drastically on the fly normal?

My DM is great and I like the game. But recently I feel like there are fights we aren't supposed to win or things we aren't supposed to do. Like DCs for normal things have gone up to 20+ because we are playing at a high level or monsters suddenly have a 23 AC when before the exact same named monster had a 21 and its only been a month in game. But the DM has said that the story is chosen by the players.

My DM is great and makes an awesome story.

I'm not going to confront my DM but I need to know. Was I supposed to lose here? Is stuff supposed to be ramped up that much? Or does it not matter?",18,1585367561,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqcski/i_think_my_dm_made_an_encounter_i_couldnt_win_is/,DnD,1

It's been a trope of mine, trying to set plans and get a group together in any form (table, Roll20, etc.) since starting my career and family. Every time, the attempt failed past the ideation stage. In fact, there was a in-person group that we rolled characters, but our schedules weren't aligning.

With the pandemic, I made a resolve to connect with others to maintain my sanity and help friends and family get through these times. In the span of 24 hours, I had set-up a Roll20 session with most of my group that was sputtering to meet IRL, as well as a good friend who had moved away after college across the country.

I was nervous running a new (to me) edition, but I put in a good amount of time in the hours leading up to the session porting the maps/setting up encounters/selecting background music. Low and behold, the adventure started off a touch shaky as I started to get my sea legs. Pushing forward, we managed to successfully finish the module I had selected in two sessions, even after a near TPK!

From my understanding, Artificers focus around constructing infusions into items and like, ""crafting"" spells to use in battle while wizards are scholarly innate casters that use a ton of magic?

Any explanation would help greatly!",5,1585364533,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqc1v3/new_player_wizard_v_artificer/,DnD,1

The session went great and they entered this worlds boarding school as new found friends after one of them .

fqaj4x,Hungry-san,Major Exploit Found with Rogues and Counterspell/Dispel Magic,"So this uses multiple rules that by themselves are fine but combined make the Rogue class infinitely better at dispelling magic and counterspelling than even Abjuration Wizards. Let me explain.

So on page 141 of the Dungeons Master's Guide it says that "" A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability - perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature - your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply. "" This is important because you explicitly add your proficiency bonus to the rolls of Counterspell and Dispel Magic.

Next is the 11th level Rogue feature, Reliable Talent. This feature states "" By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. ""

Now for the most important part: Counterspell and Dispel Magic both require you to make ability checks and even refer to the roll as such. The DC equals the spell's level + 10. So to Counterspell a 3rd level spell you would need to roll a 13 or higher.

So it boils down to this. Counterspell requires an ability check in which you add your spellcasting ability but since you don't have one you add your proficiency bonus instead. This means that since you don't technically have to be proficient but merely add your proficiency bonus you can proc reliable talent with this spell and also Dispel Magic. This means that when an 11th level non-Arcane Trickster Rogue (having a spellcasting ability defeats this entire build) casts Counterspell they can reliably cancel spells of 4th level 100% of the time. This makes Rogues better scouts and trap watchers than literally *anyone* else in the party. By being proficient in Perception they will almost always notice the trap and thanks to this trick, if the trap is magical, they can almost always dispel it. To say nothing of the absurd power of having a minimum Counterspell of 4th level.",29,1585358768,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqaj4x/major_exploit_found_with_rogues_and/,DnD,1

fqagpz,EmbracivePenumbra,Need Ideas for Tasks That Corrupt PCs,"(I'm posting my original question to this subreddit in addition to the Curse of Strahd One so more can see this and help.) 

SPOILERS FOR CURSE OF STRAHD MODULE!

SPOILERS FOR KRIVAZ, ASTRA, REYNALA, &amp; ZION!

I've read all of the discussions posted in the Dark Powers section of the CoS megathread, as well as getting inspiration from relevant, supplemental material. I'm confident with how creative I'll be, once my players start interacting with their respective, dark powers connection more, but I'm lacking ideas for the first few, subtle requests the dark powers would ask.

My current challenge is coming up with **specific tasks/quests** to trick the characters into completing or coaxing a regular flaw of theirs to come out more frequently and intensely. The characters would be performing actions that are increasingly morally questionable, but because the requests start out small and the rewards/boons become more relied upon, it will be too late before the characters suspect anything.

The following information is a quick overview of my players' characters.

Krivaz:

* Vedalken wizard (school of necromancy)
* Lawful Evil (is hostile against other evil beings that don't maintain order)
* Very diplomatic (tries to form mutual relations with anyone and -thing that seems beneficial to him)
* Deceptive and blunt
* Curious and methodical (approaches anything new/strange, even if hostile, with a scientific approach)
* Elitist (comes from wealthy but toxic family); Sexist (Ireena &amp; female PCs have been doing a good job of challenging his norms, both verbally and through demonstration)
* Has been contacted by Fekre, the Queen of Poxes, in a dream
   * Their relationship is mentor &amp; apprentice
   * Theme is disease and the mutation of disease from resistance/evolution (Krivaz agrees that disease is a natural way of cleansing populations.)
* Plans on having a civil meeting with Strahd soon; Considering replacing Strahd with Ireena as Barovia's ruler (not aware of what that actually means nor any of the consequences)
* New to someone sincerely caring about his well-being (Ireena)

Astra:

* Half-elf paladin (oath of devotion)
* Lawful Good (hasn't shown any efforts to interfere with Krivaz's approach to things nor other evil acts by others)
* Surviving heir to royal throne
   * Caretaker and maternal figure is Morwen Daggerford (urgently trying to return to her, to prevent a prophesied death)
* Keeper of wayward souls (generous to a fault) (I seriously didn't intend for Astra to actually parade around a band of misfits.)
   * Queen Ravenovia's soul is trapped in a scarecrow and has been following Astra around.
   * Lancelot is Dalvan Olensky's dog.
   * Piddlewick II has imprinted onto Astra (she has said some things that I will make Piddlewick II interpret literally which will result in Blinky being seriously injured/dead).
   * A wereraven whose identity/true nature remains a secret
* Has been in contact with a dark power pretending to be a shard of Selune

Reynala:

* Feral-tiefling rogue (arcane trickster)
* Chaotic Neutral
* Distant (stifles the fostering of intimacy in relationships)
* Untrusting
* Children gravitate to her, and she has a soft spot for them
   * Fascinates them with her prehensile tail and puppet shows
* Sensitive towards corrupt businesses and the manipulation of honest laborers
   * Mother was an inventor who tried to defend against the theft of her designs by a powerful corporation; Mother suspiciously died in prison
   * Takes justice into her own hands, rather than trust the law to handle things
* Recently showed impatience and quick disinterest in hostiles that don't prove useful in interrogation
* Hasn't been visited by a dark power yet (new player that joined right before Vallaki), so I need to build trust in addition to a corrupting task

Zion:

* Human cleric (light domain)
* Neutral Good
* Egyptian background
   * Strongly opposes looting graves and resurrecting the dead
   * Worships Ra
* Has been in contact with a dark power pretending to be Mehen‚Äîa serpent god and minder of Ra, when Ra journeys into the underworld at night
   * Believes Apep swallowed the sun here and that Apep's allies are everywhere in Barovia
* Cremates the dead, fearing that they will rise again (fire obsession)
* Previous hesitation and indecision almost proved fatal for someone else

The character that I'm least concerned about is Krivaz, since he is willingly interacting with Fekre, knowing full well that she is evil. Reynala might be the most challenging, because she is untrusting and doesn't practice a religion I can pretend to be an avatar or member of.

fqa0uf,Vea-ske,Somebody invited me to a campaign. I've only had bad experiences with d&amp;d and unsure if I want to retry d&amp;d again,"Hello guys. I don't know if this post will be deleted or not or wrong subreddit but I want to explain my story and your ideas...


I'm 18, senior in high school. In my junior year, I was introduced to d&amp;d by a few friends and fell in love. I was supported by these friends in my very first campaign. I loved it, I truly did. I was a Tabaxi named Leaf and we were doing a campaign of chasing a demon as bounty hunters for a wizard. Somebody wanted to join, who is a transgender guy, and he said two years ago I misgendered them (which I had no memory of, nor knew the guy much at all), and claimed to have PTSD from it, and the DM, my friend, heard of this, and to add him, I was kicked out for harassment of a fellow player, as they called it.
My next campaign was with a bunch of other former friends, which I was in the worst time of my life, the DM allowed me to vent to her, but after two days she said she had enough if my venting and kicked me out and left me to myself in my dark times,
My third campaign was a school club. I was there and playing with strangers in school until somebody made a false claim of me harassing somebody (later proven to be false as I was the one harassed) in another class, and with my school's 0 tolerance policy, without proof, I was suspended from school clubs for the rest of the semester, and was kicked out of that campaign.

I've always wanted to cry whenever I heard of d&amp;d, because my friends in the first campaign still play it and still openly talk about it to me who always felt angry because they kicked me out because of a guy saying I misgendered two years ago and my presence would cause him PTSD, I hated it. I felt like a terrible person.

Due to the whole virus, I'm in a place where we can not leave our homes. And my friend's birthday is coming soon and wants to start a campaign online to connect with us for a while. She wants to bring her old friends, including the transgender guy who never wants to see me due the misgendering three years ago, but she's the DM, and promises she won't kick me out, and to give it a shot after so long...

Should I try d&amp;d again? I hadn't played in over a year due to these events and it makes me upset, but part of me wants to believe it isn't always like this, always being treated like garbage and thrown out. I want to get over a fear of a tabletop RPG but fear more exclusion from people who swear they won't kick me out.",29,1585356919,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fqa0uf/somebody_invited_me_to_a_campaign_ive_only_had/,DnD,1

fq9ucn,HalfNatty,DMPC in a one DM and one PC setting?,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm posting this hoping to ask a very specific question about providing a DMPC in a duet situation.

I recently introduced my girlfriend to DnD and I‚Äôm trying to get her a little more into our campaign; kinda like breaking up the monotony.

We‚Äôve had 2 sessions so far, and they worked out pretty well; she‚Äôs a natural and roleplaying. What‚Äôs tough though, is she says that she feels like she‚Äôs missing out on character building by not having another players there. She still wants to keep the game as a duet; so the option of introducing another player is moot.

She says she wants me to have a character in the game; a DMPC, if you will. I have my reservations, because I personally don‚Äôt believe in the DM having a PC in the campaign.

However, because of our very specific situation, I‚Äôd make an exception for her. My question is, what are some big rules you guys would lay down if I were to have a DMPC in our campaign? Is my DMPC allowed to have a backstory? Is my gf‚Äôs PC allowed to involve the DMPC in everything?

I already know:
1. No decision making
2. No suggesting options as the DMPC (I suggest many options as the DM, mainly because she‚Äôs new, and tbf so am I to DMing)
3. No forcing her to choose one option over another",5,1585356258,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq9ucn/dmpc_in_a_one_dm_and_one_pc_setting/,DnD,1

Same with some constructs and some other things like creating oozes and bestowing more interesting curses. And while some could say it‚Äôs up to the DM‚Äôs discretion, I feel there should be some information on the subject of raising other more interesting creatures from the dead.

fq8x1c,Blazed_Blind_Bandit,"""Spellbooks"" and Spell check lists by class","Hello everyone! First time poster and I hope this is the right place for this but..

So I just started playing again, well DM'ing my first time really, after about 12 years and my how things have changed with 5E!  I noticed combat taking a while since my group is full of casters and no one seems to know exactly what their spells do, they're all newbs so no fault of their own really.

So I decided to create a spell list for each class in the 5E PHB, that sorts the spells by level, then alphabetically. Each spell has two boxes to it's left; One for ""Known"" and the other ""Readied"". Also, I created a ""spellbook"" of sorts for each class, that has all of their spells listed, by level and alphabetically as well, that holds all relevant information pertaining to each spell; Name, level/type, casting time, range, components, duration and effect.

I figure if each player has that spellbook available during playtime we won't need to pass around the PHB whenever spells are being slung, saving time and allowing for more time to be used for adventuring and fun! I also figured other would be interested in something of the like, so I'm here to share it. Each class has it's own word document, and the spell ""check list"" is on an excel spreadsheet with each class having their own tab at the bottom. Eventually I plan on creating a cover sheet for each class, printing all the spellbooks and putting them in their own notebook type deal.

Below is a link to a .zip file that contains everything. Let me know what you think and I'm open for suggestions if y'all have any. Thank you and have a great day/evening/weekend!

fq8p6m,NjniaVanDerWald,Just had my first proper GM session in DnD and almost killed the whole party,"10/10 would do it again. Next session i'll kill 'em for good!

Last week i asked on one of my discords for a group to test out lost mines of phandelver before i would unleash its glory unto my children and luckily i found some willing guinea pigs of which some even knew DnD already and helped tremendously navigating through its rules.

It turned out i had even less time to prepare than anticipated and so i went in with my nervous level over 9000. But Alas, everything went well, they got the carriage, headed out to phandalin... and while scavenging alone the dwarf found the horses, let himself get ambushed and the others not being able to get a unified decision dragged their discussion right infront of the cragmaw caves where they barely survived another ambush if only for some good rolls from the dragonborn who went fullon Doomguy on the poor goblins. It was a massacre on both sides, but yet they managed to escape with sildar and their dwarfen companion leaving behind pieces... PIECES!!! of goblins for the others to find. 

When they came back after a short rest the remaining goblins had tried to fortify their hideout too scared to object to Klarg but also not very motivated to fight the monsters who had mercyless slaughtered their brethren and left their remaining bits laying around in random order. Heck, some of the corpses were missing limbs and others were too unrecognizeable to be assigned correctly. They also seemed to have captured one youngling only to slush his head open when the poor dude was still constrained. True monsters, they must be.  
The remaining goblins tried to wash the party out, but when they eventually went to check, the first fell to a trap meeting his fallen friends fate. At that point the last 3 goblins finally decided to jump ship.

If not for some very well placed onehits the party could have died at any point and often enough came very close. I even scaled the amounts of goblins back and forth, sent the wolves away, but they still had to fight Klarg and his personal wolf as they assumed Gundren still somewhere in the cave system. (Had they only taken their time speaking more to sildar instead of sending him off with the next caravan crossing their path).  
I mocked them telling how i would finally kill them. That riled them up plenty. They still made it out of that fight just barely alive. Like litterally barely. Two down, one of the remaining an useless bard who failed half of his rolls and the dragonborn who was adamant to tame the ~~wolf~~ ""puppy"". I was soo short of scaling ~~Klargs~~ ""furrys""(Why on earth did i make the mistake of describing him as a furry beast?!) hitpoints, but decided not to. Still they made it. A more than welldeserved victory everyone could feel proud of.

And the puppy is still not tamed by the next day. But it critical wounded its new master as he was attempting to get near him yet he doesn't want to give up on it.

I hope next session will go just as smoothly, but i am probably going to push my luck with that.",0,1585352357,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq8p6m/just_had_my_first_proper_gm_session_in_dnd_and/,DnD,1

fq87kz,RoyalRen,Dragonlance OC part two,"After the War of the Lance, we all parted ways I decided to go North towards Palanthas. When I left it was nighttime so I travelled all night and day on foot. Until I found an old inn too be honest I had no idea where I was all I knew was I was going North. I got a room and stayed the night the next day I bought a horse from the innkeeper. We set off again when it reached noon I found a small village that I had never been to before. The minute I rode into it something seemed off everyone there was looking at me with a burning hate in their eyes. I figured it was because I was a stranger, I was wrong. The minute I dismounted I was surrounded and questioned, who was I?, why was I here?, did I have any weapons they couldn‚Äôt see on me? It was strange but I figured they were just being cautious after all a war had just ended. I answered truthfully and explained to them I was just passing through and needed some food. They didn‚Äôt care and told me to get out, so I did I mounted up and left.

¬†¬†¬†I was so confused as too why I was told to get out, but I figured they were just scared. Then I realized, when I had entered the village I had moved my bow and arrows to my torso so they could see. What I had forgotten was that Kitiara had my bow specially made when I was nine. She had gotten it engraved with the words ‚ÄúBe the strongest you can be -Kitiara.‚Äù They had read it and realized I had some relation to her the dragon highlord they had fought against. The rest of the trip was pretty boring, it was mostly just woods. When I finally got to Palanthas I went to an inn and passed out the minute I hit my bed. That night I had a memory cross my mind, it was about when I was about six years old. I was walking through town with Kitiara who had stopped in for a visit. We stopped at a jewelry stand and I watched her pick out a ring on a chain. She handed it to me and told me too wear it always. When I woke up I looked at the ring and thought ‚Äúfunny it represents me perfectly a bow notched with an arrow with a spell book behind it.‚Äù I got dressed and went downstairs, ate, and checked out. I walked around the shops a bit then put on my robe and headed over towards the tower of high sorcery. I got out my charm and went inside making sure not to be seen. I walked up the many flights of stairs till I got to Raistlin‚Äôs study, I walked inside and there he was my brother. ¬†¬†¬†",0,1585350787,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq87kz/dragonlance_oc_part_two/,DnD,1

\*\*\*\*First of all, the following post contains minor spoilers about the 5e campaign of Elemental Evil so if you don't want to ruin it for you, skip the post! ;) \*\*\*\*

I 've been running the Elemental Evil with my group and the first part of the campaign was built around a player who wanted to save him brother, a Mirabar noble, from captivity. That player however was also a member of Zhentarim who decided to use him in order to make Zhentarim look like the good guys who saved the day. So after visiting Bargewright Inn and explaining that they are in the rescue mission, our good faction helps them with plenty of money, potions, weapons and having their agents spreading all around that a noble Zhentarim hero saves the day. They even organised a tourney that they helped him win with maybe not the most fair ways. After he enjoys a hero's welcome in every little village of the area, they manage to save the hostages, who tell them that they must continue because from what they saw there are bigger things in play here and the cults are about to make a big play. Zhentarim however have other plans, as they want our hero to be with the returning Mirabarians in their return home, in order to be recognised as a hero there and help the faction grow its roots. The heroes choose to continue the anti-cult campaign and the Zhents feeling betrayed sent a small party of mercenaries to kill them, but they failed. How should Zhentarim react from now? Continue the pursue with a bigger party of murderers? Spread rummors about the PCs that they are in league with the cults? Try to make a new deal with them? Or ignore them and try to take what they can by returning safely the Mirabarians?",7,1585347941,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq7bgt/is_betraying_zhentarim_against_your_health/,DnD,1

fq6ig0,NICWARREN13,The Sorcerer wants to wish a city back into existence. [5th edition campaign]," 

In my campaign of currently 18th level adventurers. They just uncovered a plot to overthrow the kingdom, by the order known as the King‚Äôs Library. These are an order of the most powerful mages in the kingdom. The King‚Äôs library served as advisors on magic. With duties such as maintaining magical order by controlling who has access to magical knowledge, and guarding the kingdom‚Äôs secrets against magical threats. The King's Library has great influence within the Royal Court. This level of Corruption by the cult within this order was exposed by the players to both the king, but also other members of the King‚Äôs Library that were not within the cult, which was about a little over half of them. They forced the leader of the cult, and his followers in hiding for the time being, and the level 18 Sorcerer has convinced a sizable portion of the mages to leave the order, and join him to form a council that will not forcibly control the knowledge of magic like the kingdom did. To form a council that will oversee the creation of new magic techniques and technologies and offer guidance and wisdom when things go too far, but not limit the study of magic and the progression of society.

Basic background on the character

Level 18, Wild magic sorcerer

He was raised by wizards after an accident resulted in his father's death when he tried to tap into a very large arcane leyline. In living with the wizards he saw first hand the amount of control the council had over magic and wants to break that control.

His whole goal is that he can use the Arcane to bring a new era of prosperity to the kingdom.

So everything is going pretty well for this guy as he has convinced about 5  of the most powerful and prominent Archmages, and about 20 less prominent but still relatively powerful wizards to join his forces. He approached me after that session and told me that he wanted to cast his first wish spell to revitalize the ruins of an ancient floating arcane city that was destroyed after an event called the sundering. The city in the past was continuously powered by being on top of arcane ley lines and he is planning on keeping it that way.  I really don‚Äôt have a problem with this since the other characters have achieved, or are planning to achieve similar goals within the next couple of sessions. I mean the battlemaster fighter is supposed to be running a small kingdom in the north, so honestly what's a small city.

The wish spell is a pretty tricky spell though so I wanted to know how you would word a spell that revitalized an ancient city to what it once was. How precise should the wording be, and how harshly should it be punished if it is not worded properly. Honestly, I am leaning towards the side of letting him just do it and ignoring the text about the more powerful wishes can have drawbacks, because it is not coming from a Genie or a Demonic Contract, and it is a mutual decision, that will give that character a cool place in the lore that the other players have found or are currently finding.

So Reddit, what do you think about this plot, and any advice for a relative novice GM, as this is the first game that I ever GMed.",8,1585345383,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq6ig0/the_sorcerer_wants_to_wish_a_city_back_into/,DnD,1

fq5ipu,Qmagds,Character concept: Pyromaniac baker,"Okay so I'm pretty new to DnD, and I have neither played with a sorcerer nor made one, but this concept just popped up in my head I felt a need to share, even though I might get some details wrong.

So what I was thinking was a sorcerer who mainly uses fire spells. They were a baker before they started adventuring and used fire spells to cook their pastries. The thing this is based on is the fact that if you throw a lot of flour in the air and light a fire in the ""cloud"", the grains of flour will ignite eachother and cause an explosion.  What I was thinking was that this character has some sort of flour bombs, or simply a bag of flour that they can take a handful from and throw. Then thay ignite the flour with a fire spell, and boom. It might also be good as a kind of smoke bomb? I just wanted to put this idea into words, let me know what you think!",3,1585342490,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq5ipu/character_concept_pyromaniac_baker/,DnD,1

fq5gyr,ProofOfAConcordKept,Help/problem solving situation,"So I'd like to ask y'all for some assistance. Me and some others are new to dnd and started a session yesterday . Right now me and my group are going through a trial of wit to get into these guilds. Anyways me being a wizard(highelf) and a warlock(halfling) are trapped in a room with various puddles of slime everywhere. The room is basically a cube, we've inspected all the walls,floor and ceiling with no ways out. The slime is not hostile, however whatever touches it becomes stuck to it. Currently I am laying with my back on the slime (Don't ask). Heres what we have done to it.

Fire bolts = small parts being blown off otherwise no effect

Licked it(don't ask)= no effect 

Touched it = finger now stuck to slime 

Laying on it = completely stuck and useless 

Heated up = no effect 

Does not react to stimuli and shows no want to capture things or move 

When struck with fire noxious fumes rise 

We've tried to freeze it = no effect 

Tried to burn the slime away from finger = no effect 

It could he mentioned that before I jumped into the slime I could walk around the room with the slim on my finger still attached and stretching as I walked further away

The slim was observed to gather its mass and become more condensed as I walked further away

It was blasted with a eldritch blast and was moved some but otherwise no effect 

Water and ink just roll off the surface of the slim 

Here is what is available to us as far as resources go.

A Dungeoneer's Pack

Spell of prestidigation 

Eldirch blast 

We've tried lighting it on fire with a torch = no effect 

Cleaning it just makes the slime a little more clear but otherwise no effect

We've performed a history and investigation check on it to no useful information 

My warlock friend is the only one able to move about. I am completely stuck and cannot cast spells. He tried using a rope and pulley system to get me out but that did not work

fq5cai,Pelagaard,Character help,"Hello, the recent lack of commutes has allowed some of my old university group to habe the free time to start a new campaign, and I'm looking for some advice on the character I want to play. We'll be returning to the campaign world we use to use, but it'll be set far enough in the future that out old characters are long dead (3.5E to 5E rationale). We're going to start at lvl10, use the Standard Array for stats, and any official publication is viable.
Basic concept:
Goliath Eldritch Knight 7/War Mage (?) 3 that uses a glaive as his primary melee weapon. 
Standard Array distribution after racials:
Str: 15 Dex: 10 Con: 16 Int: 16 (after lvl6 ASI) Wis: 12 Cha: 8 
War Caster at lvl4


The backstory is that he's from a clan the traditionally provides elite troops to the Empire's military as part of their fealty. The change from EK to wizard is a result of completing his military service and a desire to delve further into the arcane. 

What I'm looking for is advice on spell selection and wizard school if war mage isn't the best idea. I'm not looking to min/max, but I also don't want to feel useless. Not entirely sure what everyone else is planning, but we'll probably all fall into the roles we use to play, so my plan is to stick with wizard for the duration. I like to play heavily armoured casters that can hold their own in melee.  We plan to do a Session 0 to determine how this particular group of 5 comes together and make any tweaks to our characters to make that work.

I'm definitely taking booming blade, and I want to stick to thunder/lighting and cold for spell damage types. Shield and maybe blur and misty step for more defensive/buff spells.

fq59y9,Jpbo83,Looking for help to create some sort of Festival/Contest,"Hello!


My PCs will soon encounter a Kingdom (Bannerpass) that is stuck with an invasion of some sort of Vikings-ish ennemies I named Drakkash.

Bannerpass will want sone sort of truce by accepting the challenge of these Drakkash instead of wasting so many people in a war.

Im planning some sort of tournment with points awarded to the Victorious, for example :

-Arm wrestling ( 3 rounds of DC STR )
-Jousting
-A duel
-A duel to the death
-A game of Griftball, a mix between soccer and football
-The finale would be a race to get a Dragon's Tooth.

If the Bannerpass faction and the heroes representing the faction can win more points then the Drakkash, then the Drakkash would find the faction respectful and strong enough to let then alone and they would leave to invade another Kingdom.

Im looking for some fort of suggestion of other activities for this activity/Contest!

I am building my BBEG and am wondering how best to set up his minions to help fill in the story. It will be a lich, with mostly undead minions, that I am having my PC build up to. I was thinking of have a set up of roughly this. 

Lich/dracolich

maybe Death Knight

5ish necromancers with them facing them individually and depending on how well they are completing them having them face the last 2 together.

Having each one specialize in using mostly 1 kind of undead, skeletions, zombie, spirits. Maybe having one of them training another necromancer so having a fewer lower level mages with them.

I am also wonder what is the best way to help fill up their exp because I know it will take a while for them to reach the lich 15-20. will be starting at 3 of 4 depending on how many players I have.

fq3tt8,FullOpiateTubes,[OC] [5e] What will happen tonight? DoIP playthrough with new players and new DM,"**MAJOR SPOILERS FOR DRAGON OF ICESPIRE PEAK AHEAD**

My party is doing very fun stuff. They think they're immortal. They've won all of their battles with only one minor casualty. I've decided to adopt this revision to DoIP from /r/DMAcademy : https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/e77dmi/dragon_of_icespire_peak_revised/

This revision is being used because it creates a better atmosphere. This campaign misses out on a lot of great opportunity to build suspense, but their revision fixes that. 

So my party is out to do some reconnaissance on a party of orc raiders that were spotted by patrolling officers of Neverwinter's army sending supplies to Leilon (I created this group as a hook to connect them to the later parts of Beyond Dragon of Icespire Peak). They went out to Conyberry only to find that the village was long since ransacked and pillaged, but they found tracks. Our party's ranger made a strong perception check with their preferred enemy being against orcs to see that the group has over a dozen orc warriors and at least two larger monsters that have been unidentified. The party travels the seven or so miles south, following the tracks until it led them to the Shrine of Savras.

I created a large rock they could hide behind to get a better look at the Shrine. It was the dead of night, but the ranger insisted on sniping a guard at the northeast tower. She aims, fires, with disadvantage rolls a 17, then an 18. Hits after casting hunter's mark, and raises her total damage from 12 to 14. It was so badass, that I just took the orc as dead. 

In the book, the tower is only about 25 ft tall, but here I made it 45 to see if they would explore the perimeter. Nope! Our Forest circle Druid casts spider climb on the ranger and she walks up the wall to tie off a rope so that they'd all climb up. Pushing the body off the tower to avoid suspicion, the party climbs down to the front door, and this is where we pick up tonight. 

What they don't know: 

1. The front door is trapped with an alarm and if it's pushed past a certain point, it'll knock a few clay and porcelain vases down, causing them to shatter and wake up the guards.

2. There are multiple entrances to the shrine, but if they don't search, they'll never find them. 

3. The other two large monsters are in fact ogres. If they end up making the alarm go off, I'm going to have 3 of the 4 sleeping orcs immediately wake up and grab the others to help. The two ogres are in a room where the door was completely torn down. They will run around the temple to flank our adventurers in a surprise attack. 

Very excited to see where this takes us tonight!",0,1585337463,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq3tt8/oc_5e_what_will_happen_tonight_doip_playthrough/,DnD,1

fq3du1,Randalljb,Just made my first character! I'd like it reviewed by people who played this game,"Hi!

I just finished up my first ever character sheet for DnD. I'm not in any games right now, I just wanted to make one to better understand the game. As this is my first go at character creating, I'm not sure if my character is any good. If anyone could give me some tips about what I should change on the character, whether to make it fit into a dm's game better or if it's just built in a weird way. I would love any feedback, thanks!!

fq3cza,Moonlitdarksword,"When you're stuck indoors, what better way to while away the hours than teach your family D+D?","I've been playing since university, and though I enjoy character play, I think I've found my niche in DMing, and nothing confirms that more than the time got two boomers to enjoy D+D.

My mum suggested a ""board game day"" in order to wait out the quarantine, and I throw out the idea of doing a oneshot, and everyone seemed quite on-board with it. So with the passion and drive any writer knows, I spent the night and the morning printing off character sheets, pulling notes together for encounters and NPCs, and browsing the Forgotten Realms wiki for all the minutiae you could care for.

We sat in the mid-afternoon sun as I slowly guided through the process of building a character. My mum played a High Elf Ranger (as she put it ""I want to be an eight and a half stone elf queen!""), my dad was a blue Dragonborn Paladin, and my big sister played a Forest Gnome Druid. Though the rules and setup vexed them at first, they still seemed eager to go on.

They took the role as local problem solvers in Baldur's Gate, where a noble hired them to find his missing wife. After spending some time roleplaying by searching for clues, including dad talking like a cross between a polite detective and noble knight and mum acting like an overly fancy elf royal, they found their way to the sewers. Afdter encountering a pair of giant toads, they find the wife in the company of a band of mercenaries, where it turns out she was running away from her abusive husband. The party deliberate, and eventually agree to cover the wife's escape as they fought off the noble's men, culminating in his arrest by the Watch.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how into it they got. From the voice my mum affected as she roleplayed as Maj (short for majesty), to the hums and hahs as they connected the plot threads, to my dad's meticulous note-taking, it was obvious they were having a really good time. And when they all cheered as dad rolled a nat 20 to hit, dealing just enough damage to finish off the assassin sent to silence them, I felt the same thrill any DM gets when they do their job right, the kind of feeling I've missed since my last group finished my Curse of Strahd campaign.

Though we've just cleared the table, they've asked me to keep their character sheets. I have the feeling they'll want to play again, and I'd love to show them how to level up.",0,1585336089,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq3cza/when_youre_stuck_indoors_what_better_way_to_while/,DnD,2

fq3619,socialfoxes,"How do I make/play a character who is the ""last of a bloodline""","Hi, guys

I was thinking about trying out roll20 as I can't go and play in person.  I want to make a new character that I can just throw away if it doesn't work out.

I thought that he would be the last of his bloodline.  The last person to carry his family name, and that he is cursed never to have children.

He is determined to make his family immortal, even if that immortality is only in the form of a bards song, but he is not particularly strong or brave or smart or good at magic.  Yet; despite this, despite always being afraid, and needing to rely on others more than he'd like, he still throws himself into danger over and over again, because he's determined to become a hero worthy of song and story so that his family name will live on forever after he is gone.

How would I make and play this kind of character?  I'd greatly appreciate any advice you might have for me.

Thanks

We will be **3rd level** characters, so I was trying to figure out what the best combat set-up would be for a Warlock to provide the most bang for my buck and was wondering what thoughts y'all had.

Here's what I was thinking so far: Hexblade patron, with pact of the blade boon, maybe with the invocations Agonizing Blast and Improved Pact Weapon (choosing a melee over a ranged weapon) to just kind of dump everything into charisma, but I wasn't sure if one of those invocations should be switched out for Fiendish Vigor or Repelling Blast. It seems like it would be really useful in a battle royale setting to be able to at-will and without expending a spell-slot give myself 1d4+4 temporary HP for an hour. And because there's no limit on that I could just do that every turn I'm not in combat and stack up on temporary HP while everyone else dukes it out. At 3rd level most of us will only have about 15-20 HP, so getting an extra \~6 HP every couple of turns would be a pretty big swing. On the other hand, the map we're playing on is pretty big (about \~280 feet in diameter) with a lot of things like lava/acid/pointy rocks all around, so being able to keep enemies at a distance while also forcing them into these sorts of hazards with a repelling Eldritch Blast would be a good way to keep my distance while causing decent damage from the normal blast and further debuffs/damage from whatever I push them into.

What do you think? Im mostly hung up on the invocation choices, but if there are other patron/boon combos you think I've overlooked shout em out",0,1585333021,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq2a8p/best_setup_for_a_warlock_in_a_battle_royale/,DnD,1

fq1vs2,ongeduldig,Finding balance in dm'ing?,"Hi,

I have a bit of a problem. not that big a deal but I can't really talk to anyone about it and I need to vent a little bit. 

I have a group of friends that i've been playing d&amp;d with for three years now. We begun with one of my friends as a dm, which was a lot of fun. That friend is not really feeling dm'ing anymore, so I took over.   
I like dm'ing a lot. But I have an issue with my players and that is that some of them are very particular about what they like. Which they were with my other friend, but he was especially the last half year a really good dm. So they now are comparing me with him of course, and i'm just starting out.

I'm just know that they don't like it as much with me, and that kinda sucks because i'm trying really hard. I try to ask for feedback but only one friend is really comfortable with telling me what they want to change and I also know she's saying it kindly to me. Because of experience, I know that they talk about the sessions and what they don't like afterwards, just not to the dm (when my friend was the dm we sometimes talk to each other about it, not maliciously, but just to talk it out). 

However, my friend (Peter) gave me some feedback, which I appreciate, also told me not to be to hard to myself but he gave me some feedback about something I thought I was already doing (to describe things with more details and put more effort in the characters, so that they're less 'me'). Which is now difficult since I don't know how to improve more on that? 

Peter also said that one of my friends thought about quitting and that I should give him more to play with. Problem is, that friend (Luke) never told me, he isn't very cooperative to me as a player (likes a bit of powergaming, which is ok but i'm quite the opposite). He likes more sandboxing games, but the module i'm playing with is quite short and not very easy to give a lot of room in.  It's also I think a setting he doesn't enjoy as much. I don't think they realize that i'm already improvising 70% of the story to them because they want to do something else. But I really want to make it fun for everyone! I just don't know how to!!! I don't really know what I can give him. 

The thing is, I would just talk to them about the things we can improve and I told me one friend who gave me the feedback that I would like more communication between us as a group, since I feel we talk a lot about each others backs which doesn't sit right with me. However, everytime I brought up something I wanted the group to improve on (more questions, more perception/insight checks, that they can improvise more in battles or in their actions and don't have to look at their 'list', being a bit more proactive sometimes), my friend gets salty and suggests thing I can do to make them do those things. Which makes it again, more effort on my part... I think that I really sometimes HAVE to railroad them into it, because otherwise they would just wait around for it. 

Once I literally told them to go to a tavern, then they got to the tavern and got a table, but just decided to wait around at the table, not doing anything because someone would 'give them the quest' soon. And I think that's my fault because maybe they expect it of me, but I don't really know how to make them look around... they want more of a sandbox but then I give them options and then they don't use it...

Sorry it's maybe more a bit of a rant, but I just play with this group where every player is a different sort of player (Peter is more of an actor, can be overly critical, likes detail, bit of edgyness and danger, Luke is more a powerplayer, but weirdly sometimes into the roleplay? which isn't really like him at all, Emma likes being the hero which is very easy to give, but often claims a lot of space from the other players, Charlotte likes humor and enjoys everything, no issues there at all  and is just there for the fun, and my last friend used to be the dm, is a very nice player and follows the story fairly well. He used to be a dam so he knows haha. I think he has some preferences and critique but is okay as long as he doesn't have to dm anymore l o  l. 

So I don't know if anyone will read this whole piece, but does anyone have suggestions for me how to go about it? I really want to be a better dm and watch a lot of videos but I feel my balance is just often a bit off and I want to really give every player a bit of what they want. How does anyone balance these things and still follow the story? I just don't know! I don't want my player to quit, I really like him a lot and he has gotten so much better at roleplaying, I just want him to give me another chance? I'm trying really hard but don't know how to improve except to practice more, but I feel like his patience is already low...",4,1585331868,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq1vs2/finding_balance_in_dming/,DnD,1

fq1sxl,Darkspartan108,Balancing a legendary item,"I've been working on a Legendary item for one of my players, but I feel like this might be a bit strong. What do you guys thing?  
***Thundering Lambency***

*Weapon (pepperbox), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When drawn, Daybreak emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

Daybreak has 10 charges for the following properties. The weapon regains 2d6-2 charges each day at dusk. 

**Illuminant Call.** As an action, the wielder can expend 2 of Thundering Lambency's charges, causing a burst of light and sound. All creatures within 30 feet of the wielder must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafed until the end of their next turn.

**Spells.** While holding this pepperbox, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, spell attack bonus = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier): Dawn (5 charges), Daylight (3 charges), Faerie Fire (1 charge), Scorching Ray (2 charges), Sickening Radiance (4 charges), Wall of Light (5 charges). In addition, you can cast the light cantrip at will while holding the pepperbox.

**Longbarrel.** This pepperbox's range increases to 100/400. It also gains the two-handed property.

**Misfire.** On a roll of 2 or lower, this weapon deals 2d6 radiant damage to the wielder, ignoring any resistances or immunities the wielder might have. The gun also jams.

**Curse.** This pepperbox is cused with the essence of a pheonix, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with remove curse or similar magic, you are unwilling ot part with the pepperbox, keeping it within reach at all time.

While you are cursed, you wake up after every long rest covered in soot. In addition, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells that cause fire damage, as you believe that they are unable to harm you.",2,1585331621,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq1sxl/balancing_a_legendary_item/,DnD,1

In his time there he read lots of tales of heroes, and became inspired to write a written history of Goliaths, particularly his own tribe, since his tribe still had only oral tradition. Even though he's not a bard, I plan on him being quite the storyteller, telling tales of famous Goliaths, as well as Goliath history.

 I haven't been able to find many good resources for this kind of thing though, so I thought I'd see if anyone here would share their tales of their Goliath characters, or has any good resources/stories that would be useful.

I have a player that has been causing lots of trouble lately and I have started to crack down on the issues. This player completely refuses to give their character a personality or backstory, refuses to roll dice because they want to use point buy, and they refuse to play anything other than ranger. From what I know, this player has never played any class other than ranger, and they have never given their character a personality. I let it slide in my first campaigns, but this time I flat-out refused to let them play ranger and told them they need a personality and they need to roll their stats. After multiple attempts to tell them no, they begrudgingly started to make a character that wasn't ranger. After asking about their alignment they tell me it's chaotic evil, this is fine but then I ask them what they plan on doing with it, ""Steal from the innocent"", I told the player they weren't allowed and they got mad. Am I being too harsh on this player? What things can I do to improve this situation for both me and the player?

Unlike most artifacts its construction process is known however not only are they only made on order for very specific people they can only be made by good aligned necromancers, this pendant can be split into two smaller ones, when two separate people with a strong emotional bond willingly wear each one of the pieces willingly while fully aware of the pendants powers, if they are of different races which age at different rates, the aging rate of both individuals is changed so they age both in the average rate of their species, first created by an elven wizard who had a human wife.

Bane shield/armour:

Similar to a bane weapon the enhancement bonus of this armour/shield increases in +2 when the user is attacked by its designated foe, if the designated foe touches the shield/armour it takes 2d6 points of damage

Conjurers robe:

This robe increases the duration and difficulty of dispelling spells that the wearer casts upon themselfes like theyr conjurer level was increased by one.

Camouflaged clothes (mundane) 15 PO

The one who wear these clothes gets a +2 circunstance bonus on sneaking tests, also gets a +2 circunstance bonus in hiding tests on a specific enviroment (like deserts, forests, snow, dark places... etc)

Hey Awesome people on Reddit, so I need help with my new character for an upcoming game with some friends. I had talked to my GM about using the Idea that I had for my shadow sorcerer for an upcoming game and she said yes!.  I want to go with a character that has a *Supernatural/horror-esque* feel, and I have a basic backstory set up for the character, but I really need help flushing it out This is where I turn to you Redditors for some advice and opinions for setting up this character because I am straight stumped. P.S: We all are big roleplay nerds in our group so details are going to be pretty important. 

The basic Backstory that I had for the character is that he was born a son of a warlock, his mother, and a devil, his father after she made a deal at a Crossroads in which she sold her soul. This lineage is where he gets his power, and when his mother dies, her soul is used as a bargaining chip. So now to save his mother's soul he has to collect debts from other deals the devil has made.

Basic Info:

Tiefling, Male, 18.

Shadow Sorcerer

Basic Character Traits:

Chaotic Neutral:: willing to do morally questionable things to do what he believes is right, and will do anything to free his mother's soul. 

kind, sympathetic and caring, but also selfish and protective over his loved ones.

I just was curious about any ideas to help flush out this character",4,1585328727,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq0t4u/i_need_help_creating_this_character/,DnD,3

fq0hj7,KnyghtsRespite,"Another story from my ""Japanese"" campaign.","If anyone's seen my last post, this is the same campaign that ended with me shooting an RPG into the woods...



Before things got too crazy, the clans of Kozakura began stripping land from eachother and slaughtering kinsmen.  Taking the advantage, pirates under the banner of Doragon from the West of Kara Tur (I can't remember their name, they're the Chinese equivalent) invaded with 500,000 strong - near my characters lands.

This came to his attention as a local fortress held by a lord weaker than himself sent a messenger.  Promptly, my character was prepared to ride and face this threat.  But he hesitated, realizing that a direct assault would do more harm than good.
He sent a bird to fly a message to the leader asking for a civil meeting to try and negotiate.  After a few hours, the leader accepted and set the place.  Taking a portal there (with an armed escort), we engaged in stern but masked conversation that ultimately failed...  The pirates launched their dead over the fortress walls, causing me and my escort to engage.

The battle dragged on for about five minutes - my court wizard had a special trick up her sleeve, and asked me to keep her protected until she finished casting - meanwhile, the other player engaged the enemy leader in a deadly back and forth.  Arrows were fired, beams of light cast, and my character being behind her nearly took all of the stray attacks.

As I sliced a pirate from collar to waist, I managed to turn and slice an arrow mid-air before it hit me.  I screamed a few obscenities their way, and threw a terracotta warrior to defend my back and the wizard.
My escort was causing significant casualties, and we managed to push the ships - but we realized something.

Remember how I said there were 500,000 pirates?

The gates that barred us from the ships opened, and we saw spear after spear, sword after sword glint in the sun.  We looked at each other, sighed, and screamed what we thought would be our last warcry -

and then a huge f***ing wave slammed into one of the ships, sweeping the coastline and dragging the ships (and pirates) with them.  In the span of 5 minutes, 500,000 pirates were killed by a single wave.  Who's to thank?

Keiko.  The court wizard.

Seeing that her army was destroyed in a matter of seconds, the enemy leader lost her resolve and was knocked unconscious by the other player.  We tied her up, and dragged her away to be interrogated.

But now I'm wondering, should I stay on the Dual-Wielding path?

I'm thinking of taking the Two-Weapon Fighting style along with the Dual-Wielder feat at level 4. I keep reading everywhere that TWF/DW is not a good idea in general, but I think this particular character might work well with it. (I think the character/story aspects of this choice could go either way.) Given Hunter's Mark and such. But maybe not?

An alternate approach I've been toying with is to go more of a hit-and-run combat style by taking the Mobile feat and using a single, larger weapon.

fq04w2,jgaylord87,Killed My Family with a Death Tyrant...,"My regular party skipped this week, so I invited my nieces and nephews to play with me over Roll20 instead. I decided to run a one shot I published on DMs Guild:  [The Lord of the Dead Wurm](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/307730/The-Lord-of-the-Dead-Wurm-A-level-1012-adventure?src=newest_in_dmg). I wrote it as a meat grinder and, well, it killed everybody. So, yay?

The thrust of the adventure is that it's an old school pulp action meat grinder. A zombified giant purple wurm bursts from the middle of the city cemetery and begins shedding undead. The city is flooded with zombies and skeletons and the party is called on to save the day. It begins with a pitched battle with an undead army. Then the PCs climb through the wurm's innards to reach the head where a Death Tyrant (Undead Beholder) is waiting.

They were really excited to start because I started them at level 11 and they don't usually get to play tier 3. But things got difficult off the bat. My nephew didn't feel well and couldn't join, so they were down to 3 players, and no one was playing a healer. Uh oh...

The opening battle was easy, the Sun Soul monk threw around fireballs, the rogue did rogue things, it was all good. Then they had to climb the intestine and for some reason the wizard kept trying athletics checks and falling instead of starting out with fly. They got to the stomach, which wasn't that bad, though I did get to blindside the monk who'd already been hit by shadows, with a poltergeist into the stomach acid. 

They navigated the lungs I'd populated with lungs and zombie beholders (a fun mix), then rested before the big boss. Now, I've heard of death spirals, but hadn't seen one quite this dramatic. Remember they're 3 instead of 4 and don't have a healer, so this is going to be rough. Then the wizard gets smacked with a charm ray. They're fighting back and forth, get some good hits in, until I roll ""Petrify, Charm, Sleep""... And all the saves fail. The rogue is now stoned... The monk is charmed... and the wizard asleep. The rogue fails again and is turned totally to stone and my next eye ray is disintegrate. Fun fact, if you're asleep, you fail dexterity saves. So... the wizard turns to dust. Actually, I told her the damage and she said ""oh, I guess I'm at zero hp, can someone heal me?"" and I had to tell her: ""WELL..."". Then the monk booked it.

It was weird ending a one shot with a party wipe. I don't know if I've done it before. But, the epilogue of the wurm &amp; Death Tyrant ravaging the kingdoms was fun to tell, if a bit sad. That said, I designed a death trap, and I guess I got one. So, if you want to kill people off with acid, poison and disintegrate beams, try out Death Tyrants, good stuff.",6,1585326775,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fq04w2/killed_my_family_with_a_death_tyrant/,DnD,4

fpzxgy,super-mega-bro-bro,Futurama D&amp;D: Captain Scrum's Captains Log,"So I'm running a few parties in my new homebrewed Futurama x D&amp;D crossover universe and it's been the most fun thing I've invested my time in recently.

I'm keeping downtime between sessions real time, so the PC's can chat in character on discord and decide what they'd like to do, and they've all taken to the various opportunities to interact with the characters and campaign with some serious gusto.

Here's the group of ""Captain's Logs"" from one of the PC's. His name is Captain Scrumptious (Wizard), a 1 foot fall Nibblonian (3 eyed mini-alien from Futurama, think Nibbler, Leela's ""pet"") who was previously a glorious space captain pirate but as of late has been a drunken bum on the streets of Mutant-populated Old New York City. 

The parties have now been set up with their bases of operation (anyone who knows Futurama, take a wild guess) and their sandox world is as close to reality as ever. We pick up with Captain Scrum after awaking in his new home for the first time...

&amp;#x200B;

\------------------------------

**Captain's Log, Downtime Block 1, Part 1:** 

It's early morning, but you probably wouldn't be able to tell based on the lack of light in the Planet Express cabin. During the night, a miniature creature had covered the helm's large bay windows with various cloths in order to block out the light. 

The creature had nestled himself into the Captain's chair, and was furled unto itself, fast asleep. The gentle purrs of it's breathing, briefly entered the air only to be replaced thereafter by the sound of air returning to its body.   

And all at once, the peace was interrupted by the sound of an all-too-eager robot's voice over the intercom. ""Good Morning Everybody!"" It shouted, and the sleeping creature was immediately roused from his slumber. In a fit of panic, the miniature being fell from the chair, flailing his arms the whole way down.   The being landed upon his mug, and let out a small sound, not too dissimilar from the type of noise a dog's toy would make.  As the robot trailed on, the little one gained his bearings. 

""My god."" The creature moaned, as he returned to his feet. All three of his eyes, including the one stemming from a little black stalk on his forehead, remained half-lidded, still heavy from his slumber.   His first thoughts were of the pounding dehydration headache he was having. ""First water, then liquor."" He mumbled to himself, as he leapt back into the leathery captain's chair to produce a fiery red hat that also doubled as a cushiony pillow. 

After placing it upon his head, he made his way out of the cabin.   With a shuffling gait, the creature stumbled out of the building. He had a little bit of coin on him, and reckoned it was enough for a little bit of breakfast and a drink. After that, he'd have to prepare for his role as Captain. 

It'd been a while. Perhaps it was time to shed some of his disguise; but he'd grown fond of this persona. Perhaps he'd assume it again in the near future.   

..........................................................................................................

**Captain's Log, Downtime Block 1, Part 2**

Breakfast began with a short-lasted argument over whether or not it was appropriate to be ordering a bottle of wine with eggs Florentine.   

""We don't serve alcohol here, sir."" The waitress explained.   

""Why not?"" The creature shot back, all three of his brows furrowing at the waitress. ""

Why can I not order a bottle of wine to celebrate?"" The strange accent he concocted to disguise himself fumbled out of his mouth, almost out of habit. 

And there he was, a Deep Spaceman with a Cajun twinge, seated at the table, arguing with the waitress like a vagrant.   ""Non."" He whispered to himself. ""This will not do."" He looked toward the waitress, her pants were soiled.  \[As an illusory wizard, Scrum has been regularly prestigitating poop into other people's pants. We expect this to  stop being funny at some point but so far, it has not\]

 ..........................................................................................................

**Captain's Log, Downtime Block 1, Part 3**

Somewhere along 5th Avenue, the creature admired a large window of toys. His eyes had fixated on one in particular; it was a large figure of a Captain. He was stood, regally, atop a ship, piloting it through a space field of toy meteors. 

There was no doubt about it; the little creature needed these clothes. These would serve to bring him back to the captainly valor he'd once had.   

And so he entered the store, quietly. The little bell above the door rang, and immediately gave him away.  

""Did somebody lose a puppy?"" The man behind the counter asked, as he watched this creature slink through the front door.   

""Did somebody LOSE A PUPPY?"" The creature angrily repeated. ""Non! Did somebody lose control of their bowels?"" He retorted.   

Panicked, the shopkeeper checked his pants. They were soiled. In a bluster of nerves, the shopkeeper panicked and immediately ran to the back of the store. It was not a moment after that a loud ""HEY!"" could be heard from somewhere deep within the shop.   

But it was too late; the little miscreant had already captured the action figure he'd been fixated on in the display. He quickly fished off the buttons of a very traditional--and detailed, he'd note--captain's uniform. And wrapped it around himself. It was a deep, royal, blue, that said ""Look at me; I'm the Captain now.""   

Without a moments hesitation, he stuffed himself into white linen pants and scurried off with the little captain's hat laid neatly atop his head.  ""How provident, for me!"" He shouted, as the shopkeeper rushed toward him from the back of the store. It was not only quite evident that the shopkeeper was fuming, but also, that he was a seven foot tall, meat monster of a man. His muscles rippled as he moved toward the miscreant, and a vein protruded from his forehead. But that vein was nothing compared to the ones lining his arms like jungle vines.   

The shopkeeper bolted to the door like Tyson Gay trying to escape the USADA doping tests in 2014. The shopkeeper swooped a big muscly arm down at the creature, and engulfed him with a single hand. Unable to fight back, the little miscreant let out a sigh. ""Non; I cannot be made to die like this.""   

""No. I won't kill you. You're going to fix that display and stand there for the rest of the day.... Or I'll kill you."" The shopkeeper said, squeezing the creature firmly to send the message.   A small squeak erupted from the silky furred 'Captain.' 

 ..........................................................................................................

**Captain's Log, Downtime Block 1, Part 4**

The Captain smiled and waved at the people passing by the window, often stopping to make amusing faces at the children who pointed at him. In all, the experience was quite amusing for the first hour or two. 

But the amusement was short lived, and the desire to imbibe copious amounts of alcohol slowly began to grow until he could take both the boredom and the desire to succumb to vice no longer.   ""I grow WEARY of this."" He said, through his sharp little teeth, as he nodded his head to conjur a still-image of himself. He was, after all, blessed with the ability to bend reality to his will. An ability, he most often used to soil the pants of unsuspecting antagonists.   

He quickly hopped off the display, and leapt out the door without a second's hesitation. The little bell on top of the door rang, but the shopkeeper looked up to see the ""Captain"" 'still at his post.' And so, he continued to mind his business.   

Once on the street, the hunt was on. There was a whole world of debauchery that was ready to be discovered. There was no place like New New York, for the type of antics he had in mind.

fpz2vp,LeakyLycanthrope,"Which is faster: a tunnel boring machine, or 1 dude continuously casting Mold Earth?","Answer: the 1 dude casting *mold earth*, and it's not even a close contest.

In my homebrew world, the largest of the three major city-states in the region recently opened a small lightning rail metro system as a proof of concept and showcase of the nascent technology. So I started thinking about how surely the construction process would be greatly helped along by magic--specifically, spellcasters capable of casting the *mold earth* cantrip. Then I got to wondering about how this would compare with the capabilities of real-world tunnel boring machines, and went down a bit of a rabbit hole.

But I know what you're thinking: *Why should we take this schmuck's word for it? I want to check the math!* So let's dig in!

First, let's define our assumptions. We need to know how big our tunnel is, and the capabilities of the machine we are using as our benchmark. [This article](https://newatlas.com/worlds-largest-drilling-machine-bertha/28311/) profiling ""Bertha"", the world's largest TBM as of time of writing in 2013 gives a diameter of 57.5 feet. I'm rounding this up to a **60-foot diameter** for our tunnel, partly for easier math and partly because it's a standard D&amp;D number. As for speed, sources vary *wildly*, and it likely depends a lot on the specific machine you're using and the substrate you're tunneling through. That article says that Bertha could do 35 feet in a day on that project; I've seen sources that give figures as high as [50 or 60 feet per day](https://www.quora.com/How-fast-can-a-tunnel-boring-machine-drill-under-good-conditions-How-does-it-go-that-fast) to as low as [20 feet per day](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Elon-Musk-think-he-can-bore-5-10x-faster-than-any-of-the-thousands-of-tunneling-projects-across-dozens-of-countries). I'm going to assume a speed of **30 feet per day**--somewhere in the middle, and also a standard D&amp;D distance.

Now, we know that *mold earth* can excavate a 5-foot cube in a single casting. So the question becomes, *How many 5-foot squares are there in a 60-foot-diameter circle?*. or to put it another way, *How many times does one have to cast* mold earth *in order to excavate a 6-foot-diameter circle to a depth of 5 feet?* For this, we find the area of the circle and divide by the area of 1 5-foot square (25 ft^2 ).

&gt; pi x 30 feet x 30 feet = 2,827.433388 ft^2 / 25 ft^2 = 113.0973355 ‚âà **113 times casting** ***mold earth***

Therefore, to go 30 feet, you would need to cast the spell [113 x 6] = **678 times**. To go 1 mile, you would need to cast the spell [113 x (5,280/5)] = **119,328 times**. We'll come back to this.

Next, we must ask how quickly this can be achieved. Some more assumptions are necessary here. Since *mold earth* takes 1 action to cast, I'll assume that you could cast it *at most* once every six seconds or 10 times per minute. But surely one couldn't just stand around and do nothing but cast cantrips at maximum pace for hours on end--we're only human(oid), after all. Let's assume that 1 spellcaster could average **5 cantrips per minute**, or **300 cantrips per hour** (cph).

This means that to excavate 30 feet of tunnel and match what the machine can do in a day, it would take 1 spellcaster [678 cantrips / 300 cantrips/hour] = 2.26 hours ‚âà **2 hours and 15 minutes**. Further, we can find that 1 caster-hour of work will extend the tunnel by [300 cantrips / 113 cantrips per 5-foot segment] ‚âà 2.65 segments = **13.25 feet**.  Impressive!

Now, let's assume that our construction crew is working around the clock, on three 8-hour shifts. I further assume that casting is not happening literally 24 hours a day; after all, this is a civilized society, not slave labor. Hell, with magic being so fundamental to modern life, these casters probably have some kind of union. So let's say that between a meal break, one or two other breaks, bathroom trips, and just getting from site HQ to the end of the tunnel and back, one shift is casting for 6 out of 8 hours, and the crew as a whole for **18 hours per day**. This seems to track with the figures I found for a TBM of 18-20 hours of uptime.

This means that if you had teams working around the clock in this way, with 1 spellcaster on every shift, they could achieve [300 cph x 18 hours] = **5,400 cantrips per 24-hour day**, or **5,400 cantrips in 18 caster-hours**. If it takes 113 cantrips to extend the tunnel by 5 feet, that means that in this time, the tunnel would be extended by [5,400 / 113] ‚âà **48 5-foot segments** or **240 feet**. Not bad for a day's work!

Finally, we can determine that to extend the tunnel 1 mile will take [5,280 feet / 240 feet/day] = **22 days** or **396 caster-hours** under our ""18 work hours per 24-hour day"" assumption. We can confirm this by dividing the number of cantrips required (119,328, as above) by our casting rate: 119,328 cantrips / 300 cph = **397.76 caster-hours**. Slightly different due to compounded rounding errors, but pretty good for back-of-the-envelope work!

Just imagine what could be done with 2+ spellcasters working together...

Of course, this relies on *a lot* of assumptions, and there are *many* variables you could tweak. But I think you would have to assume *very* generous parameters for the TBM and stack the deck quite a lot against the spellcaster before the TBM came out on top. Personally, I don't think it would ever happen with even a halfway-reasonable set of assumptions and variables.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this strange and unnecessary deep dive into an extremely niche, absurd, impossible hypothetical question. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",23,1585323600,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpz2vp/which_is_faster_a_tunnel_boring_machine_or_1_dude/,DnD,2

fpyeww,RoyalRen,Dragonlance OC i made i'll be making a series about her! kind of a Dragonlance spoiler,"Name: Journey Majere

Day of Life Gift: 5/15/339

Race: Human (should be Elven or maybe a Kender)

Skills: Archer, Mage.

Personality: Sweet, Will kill if necessary, Loving, Darkish magic. 

Alliance: Red Robes

Siblings: Raistlin Majere, Caramon Majere, Kitiara Uth Matar.

Friends: Tanis Half-Elven, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Flint Fireforge, Sturm Brightblade, Laurana Kanan, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Tika Waylan Majere.

¬†¬†¬†I was mostly raised by my brothers and sister, my mom was too weak to take care of me and my dad worked constantly. When I was five years old Raistlin noticed that I always watched him study. He didn‚Äôt think much of it but had me do a beginner spell anyways. I was able to do it easily and from that day forward he had me learning under his instruction. When I was six years old I was enrolled in magic school. When I was eight years old I was introduced to Tanis, the day I was introduced to him was the day I started breaking rules. Let me explain, mages are only allowed to carry a small dagger, but Tanis taught me how to use a bow and arrow. I have never missed a shot not even the first time I used a bow. It‚Äôs my main weapon in battle and I hunt for my family.

¬†¬†¬†Growing up I was liked by kids but being a mage and being Raistlin‚Äôs little sister caused me to be bullied a bit. I didn‚Äôt care but I made sure to always have a protection spell ready. Caramon was kinda shocked the day they gave me red robes, me and Raistlin weren't. After all even though my personality is sweet Raistlin¬†mostly taught me magic, plus I did break a rule by carrying a bow and arrow. When I was ten years old Kit, Caramon, Raistlin, and the rest of the group left for five years. When I turned thirteen I started working as a barmaid with Tika to make a little extra money. A little bit after I turned fifteen the day came when everyone was supposed to return home. I waited all day until around three pm Caramon and Raistlin walked in the door of the inn of the Last Home. It had been so long that they barely even recognized me!

¬†¬†¬†Raistlin told me he had taken the test, I was furious with him! When the rest of the group returned it was amazing, I forgot how much fun they all are. After the War of the Lance we parted ways again I was only seventeen so I decided to adventure a bit. I think I‚Äôll write about them some time soon, anyways see you soon!

fpxsxh,mcclintocksd,How many of you are starting a new campaign soon?,"Historically I've found that, for whatever reason, I tend to start new campaigns right around Easter.  I'm curious if I'm an exception or a rule?  Either way, I developed a tradition of starting my campaigns with a really cool Easter egg hunt where magical eggs are hidden throughout the starting town and surrounding environs.  Eggs are also gifted to notable town NPCs who hold contests to give them away.  It's a fun mechanic that encourages NPC interaction and lots of exploration.  It also helps set up campaign-long rivalries with other egg-hunting groups.  The eggs themselves have fun magical powers but using the powers destroys the eggs, meaning that the PCs have one less egg and hence are less likely to win the egg hunt.  

If anyone's interested in the idea please consider checking out an Egghunter's Guide to Adventure on DMSGuild.  I've lowered the price to 3 bucks with the upcoming holiday.  It not only describes the egg hunt mechanic in greater detail but it has 30ish magical eggs as well as an entire 37 page adventure that demonstrates how to execute everything.

Despite the included adventure Id much rather prefer that people just add an egg hunt to whatever new campaign of their own that they are getting ready to start!  The only things more fun than Undermountain, Death House, or the Dungeon of the Dead Three would be their egg-filled eggquivalents!  

Regardless of your interest (or lack thereof) in egg hunting if you are about to start a new campaign make a comment and let us know about it!  Is it Curse of Strahd or homebrew?  What level are you starting at?  What system are you using?  Are you using Zoom or Fantasy Grounds?

fpwqb5,muzzynat,Advice wanted - I'm not having fun with my character,"I'll preface this with a little about me, I'm in my mid-30s and have been playing D&amp;D online with a group of friends for almost two years. I also have played some adventurer's league at conventions, and in some local campaigns. But most weeks my D&amp;D is limited to about 3.5 hours of play, due to people having kids/other real life obligations. 

Every character I've ever made, I've enjoyed rounding them out as a person, and figuring them out mechanically. (My longer running characters have been a Human Lore Bard, a Tabaxi Swashbuckler/battlemaster/warlock,  a Hexblade crossbow fighter, and a Kenku Wizard). So when we started our Decent into Avernus campaign, I decided to make a Aasimar College of Swords Bard, from Calimport, who's back story was she had previously worked as a body guard for a Djinn Guildmaster, but had a dream about a magic sword that called her to Elturel, so she abandoned her job in the middle of the night, made a pilgrimage to Elturel, and when she arrived, it wasn't there.  This is also the first Lawful good character I've played (she's a worshiper of Tyr). Some (or most) of my problems are a bed of my own making.  

Levels one and two were a little rough, and I knew they would be, because I had to do a lot of fluffing on why my bard who's 'scimitars are her instruments' is playing a lyre and can't hop into combat because of her 14 AC, but I knew I was in for that when I rolled the character. My issue is now we are level 4, and I feel like my character is utterly disjointed in combat, and can't use like half of her skills because of personality traits I gave her.   

I don't want this to be a critique of the Swords Bard, but what I was expecting when I read it was someone who could get into the mix, and sometimes cast some control spells while attacking as a bonus action, or using flourishes to beat down larger foes beside our paladin. My experience has been that I don't have the AC to stay in combat, and the extra movement from the flourishes is kind of useless as it seems like EVERY opportunity attack hits, and you don't get enough Bardic inspiration to really become an effective fighter. Additionally, I didn't really account for how many of my spells require concentration, and with a medium AC, I drop spells a lot. So I find myself only wading into battle against minor foes, but just staying back and casting, and wishing I was playing either a battle master or a lore bard.  (This is entirely on me)  

  Outside of combat, I established that as a follower of Tyr my character doesn't like deception, and therefore kneecapped my bard from lying/disguising herself, unless it's clearly for a greater good, So I tend to find myself not doing a lot of the 'face' stuff that bards normally do, handing most of that stuff to our Celestial pact Warlock.   But the kicker for me is I received a magic instrument, clearly meant for bards, that on most builds I would have had fun with using in unique ways, but with this character, it doesn't make any sense. It's not a major item, but every other bard I've played would have had a blast with it, but for this build... it's essentially useless(I don't  want to say more and spoil part of DiA for anyone) . 

Which brings me to my problem- I don't hate my character, I rather like the idea, and I'm having fun because I'm playing with my friends. But I'm not enjoying my character, She isn't the two scimitar wielding far traveler I imagined, she's a medium use utility caster with some combat stuff that just doesn't seem to work well together, and a lawful good bard who hates deception is boring out of combat.  And what stings, is we had a Player switch to DM and SHE is AWESOME, she does great voices, music, RECORDS AND SENDS US RECAPS with all the relevant and funny parts from the prior week, and I'm dwelling on how I can try make my character 'work'. 

So here's my question, do I talk to the DM, and see if she'll let me roll up a new character, but that means MC just disappears, and suddenly a new one replaces her.  Or maybe I can switch some things about this character to make her more fun- I guess I'm just looking for advice. 

TLDR; I had a cool character idea, but kneecapped it with class and roleplay choices, and now I'm in a game where I enjoy everything but my character. Do I cut bait and see if the DM will let me make a new PC, try fix this one, suck it up for the other players or something else?",11,1585314892,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpwqb5/advice_wanted_im_not_having_fun_with_my_character/,DnD,1

fpwgag,the2ndsmartestperson,Using Google Drawings for Online Play,"So yesterday I ran my first online dnd session, and since I was too lazy to learn how to use roll20, I ended up using a shared google drawing  as a battle map. Players could move little tokens I made for each character around on the map. This worked way better than I expected, actually. I‚Äôm sure actual tabletop software like roll20 have many more features, but if you just want an easy way to show where everyone is on a map, I would highly recommend this. Also, making tokens for different enemies and PCs was really easy, as I could just insert and image and crop it.

fpwfif,SurpriseObiWan,OC Looking for musical suggestions,"Like the title says I'm looking for suggestions for songs that can pertain to story moments in a d&amp;d session. I am currently DMing a homegrew session with 5e rules, and various homebrew mechanics. The concept of this campaign is a multiverse amalgamation where different universes have been smashed together magically and various beings from different time periods and planes of existence are now existing on the same plane.

 For instance, musically, already in the session my PC's, while attempting to infiltrate and destroy a Nazi base figured out how to make the radio work through a series of checks on their Jeep and thus triggered 99 luftballons to play from the radio while they attempted their siege. What the players don't know is that music plays an integral part and can even be a predictor of things to come and events that are happening or have happened.

and so, while I have a wide range of musical knowledge, I feel I can only benefit from suggestions from you lovely people for songs that you enjoy that could pertain to things happening in the world or actions that they could take.

If you have any suggestions I would absolutely love to hear them and if this is not applicable to this subreddit then please delete.

One of my players is getting prophetic/lucid dreams due to her draconic ancestry. Another is being mentally consumed golem-style (TLOTR) by a magic crystal they stole from The Empire. 
The other two aren‚Äôt doing much, one follows the dream girl and the other has a job inside The Empire. 

It is Monday morning and they were going to leave to explore outside The Basin but they missed the dragons due to a role played argument.

The idea is that to attain that level of power the previous holder of the position has to die or give it up. These characters are called Ascendants.

So far I've got:
1. Ascendant of Justice (Paladin)
2. Ascendant of Cunning (Rogue)
3. Ascendant of Faith (Cleric)
4. Ascendant of Balance (Monk)
5. Ascendant of Rage (Barbarian)
6. Ascendant of Story and Song (Bard)
7. Ascendant of Knowledge (Wizard)
8. Ascendant of the Pact (Warlock) 
9. Ascendant of Power (Sorcerer)
10. Ascendant of the Hunt (Ranger)
11. Ascendant of the Wild (Druid)
12. Ascendant of War (Fighter)
13. Ascendant of Innovation (Artificer)

fpv0df,KuscheligerZaun,How do I make the most of an Insmouth-style-Bossfight?,"Hey everyone. first off: Siaz, Larimar, Frohsinn and Agwe - STOP READING!

I'm  running a self written campaign at the moment and in our next Session  there's a miniboss they're fighting against. I have some ideas, but I'm unsure, whether the encounter is balanced or not and how I can improve the  fight. Even now, I don't know if the fight is ""ok"" or if it should be more ""badass"" - like throwing in one big enemy and some small fray.

There are 4 players and all are lvl 6. **Moon druid,** **swords bard**, **storm herald barbarian** and **knowledge Cleric**. They also have an NPC who is a level 6 **tempest cleric** (my own spare character) which they'll bring along as backup.  
So far they burned some spellslots and lost a bit of health (nothing serious so far).

**The Plot:**  It's basically an Lovecraftian' Insmouth plot: creepy people, who like to sink vessels to the bottom of the sea and turn the survivors into fishpeople. So far they found out, that something is fishy on the island and already found a clue, leading to the secret temple, where the leader resides. 

**The Area:**  
a round temple, half of it is flooded while in the middle rests a grande altar. the ceiling is full of blue crystals. A lot of nearly transformed citizens are lining the walls in prayer, the mayer bows before the elders, who have just arrived, as the players enter the temple.

**Enemies**:  
We have: the mayor, **kraken Priest** (CR=5), 8 citizens (basically **locathah** but with 12 HP, so CR 1/8), 4 ""elders"", which are **Sea spawns** (CR=1) and a **Deep Scion**, who was a NPC on the ship, the PCs sailed on (CR=3).

I organized the fight in some stages:

**Stage 0:**  
\-either the PC attempt a sneak attack and have a full round, before anyone notices them   
or  
\-the kraken priest (or someone else notices them), which leads to a dispute, before combat begins.

**Stage 1:**  
\-the **kraken priest** attempts to summon his god (an aboleth) and draws a dagger, to spill his own blood.  
\-the **sea spawn** attack the PCs  
\-the **Deep Scion** attempts to psychic screech to stun the PC's (DC 13)  
\-the  fishpeople-citizens try to constricts stunned PCs or grab them and try  to push them to the ground. If the Deep Scion didn't had his turn,  they'll hold their turns.

**Stage 2:**  
\-if the **kraken priest**  succesfully summons an image of hid god, using the crystals on the  ceiling. They shine light, to indicate for the PCs what they might have  to do.  
\-The **Aboleth** (starting his turn after the Kranken Priest) attempts to: **Enslave one of the PCs** (primarily the druid, who has disadvantage on the save, because he ate something he should've known better), summon a **Skum** (A CR 5 monser) and **bolster the morale** of the enemies (+1 on the modifiers).  
\-the **Deep Scion** attempts to flee, to start an attack on the PCs ship, while they're occupied. (The PCs can try to follow him or not).  
\-the other enemies all attack the PCs now, prioritizing capturing over killing.

Stage 3:  
\-until  the crystals on the ceiling are destroyed, the aboleth will try to  manipulate the PCs (either with promises, and if these don't work, with  enslave).  
\-every enemy fight now with full intent and bolstered by the presence of their god

Variable:  
\-I'm also thinking about putting a Member of the crew, a CR 2 Barbarian, into the frey. He might be chained up or something at the  beginning of the battle. Possible help for the PCs  
\-there are more elders, who start taking the prisoners away. Giving the players another goal to accomplish during the fight.

Someone or something has been granting magics to townsfolk, and people are beginning to show signs of magic. We are being accused of witchcraft and must band together to figure out who the real witch is. I have a character in mind and I need help building him a bit.

Nicolo Da'Salem is a 18 year old worker at his Italian families repair store of tinkering and the occasional herbal remedies. 1 Year ago he snuck into the basement and found his grandfather's notes on Azoth Spiritual Alchemy. His family were spiritual alchemists who fled to america 100 years ago to escape christian persecution. He has spent the past year reading up on renaissance technology like firearms, anatomy and of course alchemy. He only recently tho had all of it click and his elixirs are finally taking effect (he dosn't actually believe in magic he thinks this is science).

We are level 2 (going to 3) in a very low magic game using 1600s american technology. I am going guild artisan for alchemist's supplies and planning on ritual caster as my feat. My issue is I'm stuck between two classes:

* Artificer, Alchemist
* Wizard, School of Transmutation

fptnlh,bloodangelmaster,a campaign idea,"i've always wanted a campaign were a rich elf asks you to find his timid daughter

the players then go to many lengths to find her, you eventually learn her last known location (dungeon, lair, etc) and you find her there, you escort her back home only for her to run off again when the players find her in a nearby forest she starts to do some form of incantation causing her to transform into a giant boss (lich, lican creature, demon, etc) the players then fight her and when she is low on Hp she transform back to normal and is in a coma the villagers see you and the daughter wakes up and yells help, they are attacking me causing the villagers to think you tried to kill her and they punish you (banish, imprison, execution, etc)

i think this concept would be great especially great if someone on the party has a dead wife and daughter/son backstory, this means you can say that the girl reminds that player of his dead one just to toy with character and/or make it emotional when she is close t death

fptn29,TheInfra,"[RANT][LONG] Well, he did it. The one murderhobo in the party made me lose all excitement for this game","Sorry for making this a very long rant but I need to vent and somehow put my feeling into words as some sort of catharsis.

Been playing for some years with a group of 4-5 friends, almost weekly, sometimes once every two weeks because of availability. Because Life is Life, some people stop coming or lose interest. One started a medical internship so he went to live on a small town very far. Another just couldn't get to the sessions on time, another went to live abroad for a Master's degree. There where times when we where 3 people, including the DM, so it was very difficult to come up each week with excuses for why pc's are missing in the story.

So we invited friends, family, *anyone* to try out, I brought a friend from another group of friends and he integrated perfectly with the group. Always on time, never misses a session. The DM brought his half-cousin but he warned us he is ""kind of a rough deal"" as he has a strong personality. We got 4 people + DM who could always make it without miss so AlwaysDM decided to develop a huge, world building campaign that ended up lasting about 2 years (playing once every 2 weeks and often canceling due to personal issues. But we actually got to play). When we finished, he expressed being really tired of being DM and wanting to play so I stepped up to the bat: I was the one with the least experience with DnD but wanted to try out DMing a pre-built campaign just to see how it's like. He was delighted and everyone was super supportive and encouraging. So I set up to reading up on tips, stories and developing this one-shot which was a short dungeon that we ended up finishing up in about 8 hours (2 sessions).

Now, it's been months by now that DM's cousin wasn't quite... understanding how to mesh with the group. We would often enter off-topic discussions during breaks and he's the guy that will fanatically (and very often, screaming) defend his opinions without letting the other people talk. Also, he's one of those ""anti-sjw"" types that sees ""feminism"" and ""woke"" cultures as the absolute worst thing that's completely ruining all entertainment. No one else with the group has that opinion, and when confronted it always inevitably scales up to a who-can-shout-loudest discussion. Always.

But that's just outside the game. I can't be the one asking to kick him because he has a different personality, especially with our group that's struggling to keep a good group going. Before my DM turn we had a long and heartfelt discussion with our 5th player that had missed sessions for about 3-4 months ""because of work"" but never expressed interest in making the effort. Sometimes he would just not answer the group chat and we would be left wondering if he would come. So making a problem because of another member would surely kill the group. So I just tolerated.

In-game? That's where the real problems begin. Remember how he's a ""shouty one""? Yeah, he was the type that would always Scream Instead of Initiative (""You meet a monst..."" ""I CAST FIREBALL"") but the DM would not say anything because he was his cousin (and he brought him in) and no one else said anything because of the same ""if we kick him out we need to find a 4th player"" because we're just not very comfortable with a 3 pc group, it's kinda smallish for our playstyle and socializing.

His RP/gameplay? Not ""the absolute worst"" but really irked me more and more. Instead of either just saying what spell/action/attack he uses or roleplaying it and then rolling the dice, he would always use the same expression, to the point of ridicule by us. Sometimes he wouldn't even articulate full sentences, saying things like ""... yeah so I just go FULL ON this guy and unleash on him"" and the dm would just keep waiting for an actual word term tho know what to expect, a roll, a save, something. No, this guys just expressed incoherently his intentions, and got frustrated when no one else would understand what he meant. When he played barbarian he would get into discussions because he would say things like ""I go, y'know, ALL IN with EVERYTHING I GOT"" and thought that meant he used his Rage action and got angry when the DM wouldn't let him use advantage, because, obviously, he actually never said ""I use Rage"".

Want to know his last 4 characters? Edgy Warlock, BRUTAL Barbarian, Edgy Warlock and Wizard (possessed by a demon). Yeah he's *that* kind of person.

Anyways, just half an hour ago we finished my dungeon and we had to make it online because of the virus. We set up Discord, screen share, bots for rolling dice, etc. Everything worked fine, except on voice chat is harder to communicate and hear everyone when they all spoke at the same time. In-Presence is easier because you just use body language to signal priority or calm down over-excitement. With mics you can't do that, you just get everyone trying to talk over each other and going slower because I had to call up each one's name each time there was initiative, actions, movement, etc. And, obviously, Shouty McAngry Face was *reveling* in the chaos, not only not doing anything to help but making things worse by not communicating properly (still, the same over expressing of actions without actually saying what he wanted to do), constantly derailing and distracting and interrupting with off topic comments because hey, no one can say anything. I suspect he *knows* he can do whatever he wants because no one will dare confront him. And if people actually say something? Well then, it's the ol' trustful ""talk and shout louder that anyone else and they just get frustrated and quit"" discussion tactic. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was the ending of my dungeon, when he turned full-on psycho for no reason. The story told of the party that got hired and financed by an explorer to explore some ruins, hopefully rescue the last party that never got out and bring back any treasure, with the promise of part of the spoils they got back. The party got into a *huge treasure*  (5k gp's) and a tablet with some inscription (which this guy nabbed because of a very lucky initiative roll), obviously a device to keep the story going. The story took two scenarios into account:

* The explorer gets excited for the tablet and offers the party **all the treasure** in return, just as long as she can study the tablet. 
* The party doesn't relinquish the tablet (which would be useless to them and the story because they don't know how to interpret it) and just pay the explorer back her initial investment and part of the treasure.

Because That Guy got hold of the tablet, he lead the negotiations but *everyone else in the party* agreed to give up the tablet just for the sake of the promise of more story and a good ending. But Guy got greedy and stupid. He decided he *really wanted the tablet*, even after me through the NPC expressed that the tablet is worthless to him. He somehow spun it into the NPC ""being a greedy bitch"" and angrily told out of nowhere ""you know what, fuck it"" and straight up attacked the NPC. Me and the party just fell silent. He purposely killed off any good thing that could come out of the story ""Because that;s what DnD is for, right? Doing crazy shit and having fun"".

I'm not gonna be the DM that cries because one guy derailed his ""perfect"" story because I know DnD is about choice and improvisation. But the *way* he took the decision, even after the others in the party agreed that relinquishing the tablet was for the best (and for a better conclusion). He stuck even more to his guns and just kept it all, even being warned against ""spilling innocent blood with multiple witnesses"". All just for the hell of it. Obviously I warned against consequences but at this point I just wanted things to end. All my intent to tell a story and hopefully make a hook for a next part got destroyed for a completely selfish reason.

So it's not just an unsatisfying ending, not the shouting and disrespect, not the greediness, not the horrible personality. But *everything as a package*. Everyone else agrees but no one says anything ""because the alternative is just not playing"". But I'm trough. Right now, I want to never be in the same room as this guy ever again because he just sucks the fun out of everything for his own personal enjoyment. I can't fault him for ""playing the game in the wrong way"" but I sure as hell *just don't like they guy and what he chooses to be or do*",42,1585299265,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fptn29/rantlong_well_he_did_it_the_one_murderhobo_in_the/,DnD,1

I drew a simple map of a few cities, forests, mountain ranges and set up a few basic plot hooks, main quests and side quests.

This took maybe a week and once we began playing i would spend an hour or so planning that weeks session, adding more details and depth to the world as the players explored.

After that campaign, i ran Storm King's Thunder (as i thought this would be even easier and less time consuming). I found that reading the whole book, taking notes on it, constantly referencing it, foreshadowing plot points, filling in gaps and trying to remember details was really difficult and made me spend way more time trying to plan the sessions.

It's likely a matter of play style but i found that creating loose plans based on a basic structure of a world and writing it as you go is so much easier, faster and more fun.

fpt5cm,TokenTezzie,Goblin child orphan with his own voodoo doll,"After seeing [u/EddLai](https://www.reddit.com/user/EddLai/)'s post about the troll who got a voodoo doll of himself to mourn his parent's death, I was inspired to make a character based on a similar premise.

Born amongst a small tribe of Goblins, Schnitzel was classified as a runt and thus too weak to be a member of the group. He was abandoned, and stumbled through the countryside, eventually collapsing in a field. He was discovered by a retired knight, Alderman Peres, who brought him back to his small house where he nursed him back to health. Alderman left his knightly order because of a leg injury, but he was cheated by the lord of the order who refused to pay him for his retirement, instead granting him a tiny plot of land out on the countryside. Alderman met a woman from the nearby town and married her, having a young boy. However, the young boy was born with a disease that lead to his death not long after his birth. Having not enough money, Alderman could not pay for treatment. Alderman saw in the little Goblin his  son, and accepted him as his own. He named him Schnitzel, as that was his son's favourite food.

Schnitzel lived with them for a few years, enjoying the company of Alderman and his wife, and also his little doll that he loved to cuddle with (it used to belong to Alderman's son). One day, a group of knights rode past. Alderman ran out and stopped them, as he recognized on of them as the leader of his old order. When he demanded justice, they mocked him. Schnitzel and Alderman's wife came to see what was happening, and the knights, upon seeing the Goblin, attempted to kill him (as he was a 'monster'). Alderman tried to save Schnitzel, but was struck down. The farm was set alight, and the knights watched as his wife cried over his corpse, before slaying her too. Schnitzel took his doll, and fled.

After another period of wandering, Schnitzel found himself wandering a strange forest. It turned out that he had wandered through a portal to the Feywild, and eventually stumbled upon a group of fairies. He recounted his tale to the archfey, who offered him the power to return to the world and hunt down those who had slaughtered his family. He took the offer, and became a Warlock. Additionally, his grief and pain caused his doll to be wracked with dark magic, becoming a voodoo doll linked to him. Schnitzel still cuddles the doll in his sleep, making him feel like he was once again in the warm embrace of his true parents.

fpsqh9,GetsTrimAPlenty,Rail Gun,"I think my players might figure out how to make a railgun, how should I implement that in-game?

For those who don't know, a railgun accelerates a projectile to very high velocities in order to use the speed of the projectile as a method of inflicting massive damage. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun.

I was thinking I could make it deal damage similar to that of meteor swarm, though with a smaller radius. It would be available to fire once per week, and only usable on a ship they have in the works. Then also, it might come with a percentage chance of failure, potentially catastrophically. Once they have it built, I believe they could take time to upgrade it to be more stable, do more damage, etc.

The way this came about is that, they found an ore on a torus orbiting a star. The ore was mined specifically to make interstellar craft and has anti-gravity properties. Once they had the ore they had to find out how to use it, solving a few puzzles about where to find someone who might know something about it. Then, if they want to build the ship, and potentially the railgun, they have to invest most of their gold. Then if they come up with the idea of the gun they will have to go through a quest to get the components they need to construct it. Also, I believe it would be reasonable for this construction to attract unwanted attention. For example, thieves that want to steal it and who will kill the party to get it. Or, politicians who will want this potential weapon for themselves, etc.",1,1585294060,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpsqh9/rail_gun/,DnD,1

fpsh7e,GreyAcumen,Manga/Anime/Other Media D&amp;D that have changed the way you approach D&amp;D,"I'm sure everyone has heard stories of some guy who was a little too into Goblin Slayer, and couldn't respect the storytelling boundaries other players were comfortable with, but once you get past the R-rated elements, (which also become less explicit as the story progresses) the use of environment and psychological strategies and tactical information gathering and preparation can be genuine inspirations to approach D&amp;D in a more creative and immersed manner.

Goblin Slayer is well drawn, with a wide variety of different racial builds that all manage to remain expressive. The tone is dark, with definite triggering content, but that sets the stage for the classic ""favored enemy"" that is otherwise frequently relegated to an afterthought or ""what will I be fighting the most of in this campaign"" for most Ranger builds. The clear presence of the classic D&amp;D classes, races, techniques, and spells, is also quite interesting, though there are definitely moments that could have only worked in 2e, 3.5e/PF, or with some very forgiving DM allowances. 

Dungeon Meshi (Dungeon Cooking) is a great take for anyone who has either been interested in ""eat what you beat"" lifestyles, or are just interested in the concept of a ""dungeon"" that simply exists, and how the various creatures in it could rationally persist, and how the specialized techniques so often used against adventurers could provide a tangible advantage over just killing their target normally and eating the meat.

Heterogenia Linguistico is not really Dungeon related in any way, but having chosen the Anthropologist background and leaned into it heavily, this has put an interesting take on how the process of the Adept Linguist feature might actually function.

Does anyone else have any media influences like this? To be clear, I don't mean simple setting stuff, like playing in the GoT or LotR or HP universe, or using a different game engine with rules that better leverage creating stories in that style, but where the work has actually influenced your concept of what is happening in-universe, what things your character is thinking about, as you make your choices as a player.",3,1585292645,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpsh7e/mangaanimeother_media_dd_that_have_changed_the/,DnD,1

fpsf4w,Elvalor_Amastacia,Help building a pirate?,"Hey, guys! First time posting something around here. Sorry for possible english miswriting!

So, my friend started to run a campaign about pirates on his world. The players, which includes me, were told to roll as we wanted. This means that we were allowed to roll 6d20 instead of the usual 4d6. That's ok and is nothing new to us, somehow.

I created a Changeling Bard. He is level 4 by now. His attributes are:

‚Ä¢ STR 9
‚Ä¢ DEX 20
‚Ä¢ CON 20
‚Ä¢ INT 12
‚Ä¢ WIS 19
‚Ä¢ CHA 22

You must be wondering how I got this 22 Charisma... So... The actual roll was 20, 20, 19, 18, 12, 9, which is a quite very powerfull. He got 22 on Charisma due to his race ability score improvement (by RAW ‚Äî I guess ‚Äî, PHB's don't states that racial ability score improvements can't surpass 20, only classes ASIs), and I added +1 to Wis. So, now that you now about that, here comes my doubt:

‚Ä¢ How should I build him?

I don't know if I should only take feats or should use all ASIs to power up STR and INT. Today I picked the Resilient (CON) for him, but what should I choose at 8th, 12th, 16th and possibly 19th level? I have interest in these:

‚Ä¢ Use ASIs to improve INT or STR
‚Ä¢ Observant (WIS)
‚Ä¢ Resilient (WIS)
‚Ä¢ War Caster
‚Ä¢ Lucky
‚Ä¢ Moderately Armored (STR)
‚Ä¢ Crossbow Expert
‚Ä¢ Defensive Duelist

Hope yall can help solve this! Thanks for reading and stay safe at home during this pandemic.",10,1585292339,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpsf4w/help_building_a_pirate/,DnD,1

fps8ed,Alphonse123,Visual Aids and Imagination: When is 'too much' too much?,"So, from a good while of playing the game and by watching various YouTubers (not to mention browsing the Reddit Pages), I fully grasp the way DnD is commonly played, and that, above all else, Imagination is the main lens the players have to glimpse into the Worlds we create and play in. That being said, I have see variations in the formula. Some DMs provide pre-prepared or quickly scribbled battle-maps, while some do not. Others play the game with only their heads, a notepad, and Dice, but some feel it useful to provide some form of visual aide, from a simple picture of a bustling port, or a full cross-section on a mighty mountaintop bastion. Each method works best for different people, and all have advantages and disadvanges.   


The main goal of this post is to gather advice from you wiser folk so I may better understand and the determine the most effective way for ME to convey information to players and run the game. It is also here to encourage a dialogue among DMs (Seasoned Veterans and Newbies alike) and Players to get a better idea of this community's stance on the subject- be it only a small portion.

fps20o,makrer,How well timed music set the tone for the best session I have ever ran.,"It was the third session of the campaign I was running. The campaign was horror based and I wanted this session to be like a 80's slasher movie(Friday the 13th, Halloween, etc...) My players were traveling through a blizzard and needed to get off the road, and ended up in a small village. The players went to the local inn and came across some more experienced adventures who just so happened to slay a giant they ran away from in the first session due to it being way out of their league. A scream brought all the adventures and the local sheriff  to a bloody murder scene at the local blacksmith. As the sheriff tries to figure things out she locks down the village and sends everyone inside as they investigate the scene. The players and adventuring party suspiciously eye each other and start throwing out accusations that the other is the murderer. While they shout at each other they all hear yelling from outside again. [\[I begin the music\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee1CuMf5x40). The adventures are the first to leave the inn while the players are on their heels. Outside they see a large man who is known to be the local butcher with a the head of a wolf and maggots pouring out its mouth standing over the bloody body the sheriff. At [\[1:36\]](https://youtu.be/ee1CuMf5x40?t=100) the adventures charge at it, at [\[1:45\]](https://youtu.be/ee1CuMf5x40?t=107) i begin to describe how my slasher brutally murders the adventures one by one making it seem effortless, then begin to slowly walk toward the party setting the perfect tone for the player to run screaming.

I had more than just this one song as well, i had a horror based [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ExPSMmfhOlXSHyHNQ4vSq?si=fjBumuKCTCy-H2usKS0tIQ) for the session playing the whole time to help build and to keep the horror tone going. 

Obviously there is more to running a good session than some well timed music, I spent a lot of time developing the session, and built the music around it with some extra time I had due to the session being delayed a week. If you end of doing this i'd recommend to write down queues of where you need to be in the session based on the music or practice how you describe a important visual scene with the music beforehand. To this day my players still talk about that session so I would highly recommend adding some well timed music to amp up your next session.",0,1585290351,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fps20o/how_well_timed_music_set_the_tone_for_the_best/,DnD,1

fprgdy,maggalina,Enjoying Your Non-Min-Maxed Character in a Party Full of Them,"Hello! 

Let me start this with I love my group, we've been playing weekly for a long time. Our resident min-maxer quit/wasn't welcome anymore after being the worst murder hobo but he passed the bug to one of the other players who are passing it to other players. 

It started with a coffelock. Which the unlimited heals made it not seem to be as big a deal for us. But then he got bored of it and was talking about making a new character. We are playing in eberron and we had no gun users and ended up being pretty much all spellcasters. So when I lost my wizard I made what I felt was a decently strong build but definitely built more for story than optimizing. I love my war wizard/rune knight but I was really looking forward to getting to play the big damage dealer as I've only played clerics until my wizard. 

So that's all well and good. And then min maxer brings out a gloomstalker ranger brute fighter something else completely mix maxed character that with gun feats can do 300 damage in a single turn without crits. At that point it's like ok at best with my magic weapon, my runes, and max damage I can do about 30 damage between my two hits. Suddenly it feels like a support fighter. 

But no problem, my runes can do cool things and I've got a teleporting hammer. 

Now another player is bored of his sorcerer and is min maxing an artificer ranger with gun feats and will be able to take 4 shots a turn without ever needing to reload. 

Between the two of them my damage is so insignificant I really am just there to add to everyone's AC and take hits. 

I love the role playing aspects and I wrote him what I think is a great story but the min maxers get antsy if we go to long without a fight and fights just aren't as fun when your fighter is....the weakest fighter. I've had a chance to do a few solo fights when things work out that way and it really is a lot of fun seeing my character excel at being a fighter but that's just not the norm.

During this time i've played around with most classes, built characters for most classes now (never really played with ranger or bard too much but tried the rest) and the one i've really found myself liking is my Open Hand Monk that is my current character in C2. We've just hit lvl 5 and I'm truly feeling like im quite useful. The ability I have thanks to my mobile feat to run in and knock opponents around with my OHT to knock them back, or to knock them prone and of course my stunning strike have made some fights that we were sure we would have been in trouble for not that bad

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time I keep seeing Monks listed as very low in use, in damage in ability to control in everything

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this? Why are they considered low tier, i cant see many of these abilities ( knock prone, knockback and stun) being power crept in later levels

&amp;#x200B;

Make a campaign where the big bad villain, isn't really a villain. Sounds bland, let me explain. Like just make him a normal person with like maybe grayish kinda goals but nothing ""evil"" that is just annoying as shit, constantly shows up and pesters the group or provides minor inconveniences.

fpq94w,Omni_Turtle,Trials for the Were-Bear?,"  

Hi Reddit!

I need some ideas. I've been DMing a Gothic-genre game going on almost 2 years now, and the whole quarantine business has created an interesting scenario for myself and one of my players. This player, playing a gnome druid, wanted part of her arsenal to be that she is a werebear, so we worked it out and made a lycanthropy system which essentially replaces her wild shape abilities. One of the main points of it is that she automatically transforms when she dips below half of her maximum HP, but also going into a feral state where she partially loses control (I have to say, I'm very happy with how it turned/balanced out). In game the character doesn't know where she got this curse from and wants to learn to control it better. The party just discovered a hidden village of entirely lycanthropes - due to a completely unrelated situation - who have complete control over what form they're in at any given time, something which they achieve by being trained spiritually and physically from a young age. As the party went to go on their next mission, the player suddenly asked me if this first character stayed behind to be mentored by one of the village elders, and if for the main group she could play a second character that would travel with the party while the first one trained up via solo sessions/adventures, sorta similar to how Sam Riegel did with Scanlan and Terry in the first CR campaign.

Now the caveat to all this is that this player is my girlfriend who I  am living with during this quarantine. I want to get her solo adventure underway while Im figuring out how to online DM with the others, and I'm good on places she could go/things she could do while with the lycanthrope village. But when I told her (through the village elders) that they train the villagers to control their abilities from a young age, I realized that if she'd asked for examples I'd have been stumped. I've been trying to think of some trials that the lycanthrope village elders might give to a villager to help them further understand and reel in control of their beast half. Does anybody have any ideas? Thanks in advance!",0,1585281631,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpq94w/trials_for_the_werebear/,DnD,1
fpq83f,revkaboose,[Advice] [Request] [Design] Making a death trap fun house dungeon. What are some of your favorite traps?,"Foreword: If you are a member of our bi-weekly Sunday game, hex crawl in a dead magi city known as Arcadia, **please avoid, due to spoilers**.

I'm just look for fellow DM's favorite interactive traps.  Traps that you don't just roll a search check and then a check to disable.  I'm looking for traps that are thinking challenges.  I'm looking for traps that are resource exchanges.  I'm looking for traps that can include monsters but more for utility than battle.  Ideally I'm looking for stuff levels 5-10ish

Stuff I've developed and am looking for in the same vein:

* A narrow passage that hangs over a large drop, pits on either side, with alcoves that contain skeletal minotaurs (bull rushing characters as they pass by).

* A hallway with a small 1"" opening at the top.  On the other side of the opening is essentially another hallway that contains either gibbering mouthers or banshees that the party has to pass by the area of sound but would have a difficult time reaching the monster.

* A room where there are three locks on the door leading out.  Characters suffer cold damage each round unless they light a brazier.  Lighting the brazier removes the cold damage element but releases a mediocre difficulty creature immune to cold damage.  Also, several skeletons on ledges above raining arrows.  Characters can also investigate each round for the keys in the room but this consumes their action (unless they're a thief rogue).

* The Zee Bashew trap where there's a room that closes the characters in when they enter it (portcullis, slabs, whatever works), numbers light up and begin counting down.  Each number counted down, the room grows darker and the numbers turn more red.  A large button is in the center of the room that, when pressed, resets the timer.  If the characters just let the timer run out, the doors open.  If they keep pushing the button, the doors stay shut and the timer resets.  I made an addition to this where pressing the button deals damage to the characters in the room.

This is the kind of stuff I'm looking for.  Doesn't necessarily have to involve combat but these are the ones that come to mind immediately.  Any other additions to a fun house dungeon?  Illusions, puzzles and the like would be welcome!",1,1585281500,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpq83f/advice_request_design_making_a_death_trap_fun/,DnD,1

fppoa8,CaptainsTaintBurn,My Buddy and I are thinking of making a module based off of our homebrew. All advice welcome.,"So with the lockdown, my friend and I have way more time on our hands than we once did. Our plans for the summer are 100% cancelled, and we're thinking of writing a module based off of the homebrew game we designed and played together.

Now, this is a pretty major undertaking, so I'm wondering if anybody has any advice before we get started. I have mixed feeling about many of the homebrew adventures I see online. Has anybody ever picked something up from DM's guild or that sort of thing and been really happy with it? Is the WotC model the only way to do a module?

We really have zero idea how to even move off of square 1 and get started, so really any advice or comments, words of warning you have, please give' em to us. We need em.                               

Here's some maps we made for the game, which takes place almost entirely in the City of Trost, and sometimes in the wider province of Estrickt. Lots of heists and politics and that kind of thing. Should hopefully give you an idea of where we're sorta at.

Our group doesn‚Äôt have any DM alternates, and I‚Äôm not motivated to find another group; however, since I do like writing out home brew worlds, I was wondering if I could get some advice? 

I‚Äôm not sure how it would work, and maybe you‚Äôve done something like this once/before: I want to be a playing character that the story is told through. I don‚Äôt want to be the ~story~, rather, i want my background to explain why I stop mid sentence and describe the bottom corner of a wall that has a crack. Maybe I‚Äôm an insane wizard that talks to herself and has a knack for knowing things you shouldn‚Äôt know. Maybe I have to roll to reveal different parts of the plot on my own and if I don‚Äôt make it then our party has to go on without it. 

At the same time, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to prepare a story ahead of time, only vaguely build the world. It would have to be 100% made up on the spot and let it be led by our group. I feel like I would roll out of sight for encounters since I wouldn‚Äôt have them pre-planned, same for loot and any treasure, rewards, etc. 

Another thing is we couldn‚Äôt really talk to other NPCs as I wouldn‚Äôt want to break character. Maybe it is a barren landscape we have to bring back to life.  Or maybe I start with a curse that knocks me out anytime someone talks to me so that I can allow the other players to speak with NPCs?

fpoxat,Moses_The_Wise,Sacred Vows,"3.5 had some feats known as Sacred Vows. They allowed characters to make vows to a deity, religion, cause, etc. and then gain benefits from those vows. I've tried my best to adapt them into 5e. I have not included the Vow of Purity or the Vow of Obedience feats. I understand these grant more than the typical feat, and I'm not saying that you should definitely incorporate them into your game; I'm just offering them as an option since I feel like they have wonderful flavor and might be able to be incorporated into something else. 

# Vow of Abstinence

You have taken a sacred vow to abstain from alcoholic beverages, drugs, stimulants such as caffeine, and intoxication.

You gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison and the poisoned condition. In addition, while an ally is poisoned, you may spend an action to make a Medicine check (DC equals the original save to resist the poison; if there is none, it‚Äôs up to the DM‚Äôs discretion.) If you succeed, the target is purged of the poison and all of its effects. 

To fulfill your vow, you must not consume intoxicating, stimulating, depressant, or hallucinogenic substances, including alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs. If you break your vow, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance.This holds true even if you break your vow unintentionally, such as through magical compulsion or deceit, though generally the penance you must perform is lesser in this circumstance. 

# Vow of Chastity

You have taken a sacred vow to abstain from alcoholic beverages, drugs, stimulants such as caffeine, and intoxication.

You gain resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poison and the poisoned condition. In addition, while an ally is poisoned, you may spend an action to make a Medicine check (DC equals the original save to resist the poison; if there is none, it‚Äôs up to the DM‚Äôs discretion.) If you succeed, the target is purged of the poison and all of its effects. 

To fulfill your vow, you must not consume intoxicating, stimulating, depressant, or hallucinogenic substances, including alcohol, caffeine, and other drugs. If you break your vow, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance.This holds true even if you break your vow unintentionally, such as through magical compulsion or deceit, though generally the penance you must perform is lesser in this circumstance. 

# Vow of Nonviolence

You have taken a sacred vow to avoid violence against intelligent beings. 

You may add half your proficiency bonus (even if your proficiency bonus is already added) to the DC of all spells and abilities that do not deal damage or directly cause pain. 

To fulfill your vow, you cannot deal damage to any creatures with an intelligence score of 2 or higher. If you break your vow, you lose the benefit of this feat until you perform a suitable penance.This holds true even if you break your vow unintentionally, such as through magical compulsion or deceit, though generally the penance you must perform is lesser in this circumstance. 

Depending on your character, there may be certain exceptions made; for example, you may be allowed to cause harm to fiends without losing the benefit of this vow. 

# Vow of Poverty

You have taken a sacred vow to forswear material possessions.

The vow of poverty provides multiple benefits. 

* While wearing no armor, you may make your armor class 10+your Dexterity modifier+your Proficiency Bonus.
* Your weapon attacks are considered magical. 
* You do not need to eat or drink. 
* You can exist comfortably in hot or cold environs. 

To fulfill your vow, you must not own or use any material possessions, with the following exceptions: You may carry and use ordinary (non-special, non-magical) simple weapons, usually just a quarterstaff that serves as a walking stick. You may wear simple clothes (usually just a homespun robe, possibly also including a hat and sandals) with no magical properties. You may carry and use a spell component pouch, spellcasting focus, or holy symbol; as well as any material components for spells, whether they have a gold cost or otherwise.

I‚Äôve mentally made legitimately, close to 50 characters, all maybe revolving around a certain idea, class, the like. I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm a ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù player, I enjoy DnD, it‚Äôs a great creative outlet for me, via homebrews or characters; but I heavily struggle with wanting to change my character; this isn‚Äôt fair to the DM, fellow players, or truly myself. I believe I‚Äôve found myself treating DnD more as a video game rather than a ‚Äúboard game that isn‚Äôt about the game, it‚Äôs about fun‚Äù, and I‚Äôm trying to tell myself to just play your character idea, and roll with it. (I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúroll with it‚Äù person; I plan. A lot. Too much)

For example; I first created a character, who didn‚Äôt really have any goals, motivations, or long term things besides coin, heavy artillery/guns/big-boom things, ladies, and personal gain... Yet, everyone loved him, I had fun playing as him, yet he didn‚Äôt fill in any roles, he wasn‚Äôt that great in combat, and I didn‚Äôt have any clear future ideas for him besides: ‚ÄúI wanna make explosives‚Äù. He had a shitty, raspy English accent, a snarky attitude, and was morally unpredictable.

I don‚Äôt know if it was my group who weren‚Äôt very RP heavy, if it was the games that felt sort of rushed, or if it was just me, but it‚Äôs something. I have been looking for another in person group who isn‚Äôt overshadowed by a store‚Äôs timeline, a group who‚Äôs wanting to play a more serious/gritty though still semi goofy game (and people closer to my age), and one that wants to just enjoy playing a board game with people. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too much of an expectation, because it does seem very ‚ÄúCriticalRoley‚Äù now that I think about it. (I am a product of Critical Role, that got me into DnD...)

I want those year long, heartfelt, invigorating stories that people seem to have. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs rare or not...

Nonetheless, back to my main point... I want to know how to play as a character, or more so, how to create a character I‚Äôll enjoy playing as for months.

And of course I‚Äôm putting this at the end-

Half orc hard who plays a triangle, an aarakocra blood Hunter who has a passion for communist Russia, and a dwarf who loves his alcohol... And me, a dragonborn wizard that has an immense fear of technology.

Unfortunately for my character, the setting is in a steampunkish new Vegas city.  Not feeling the vibe at all because technology and fancy lights is the devil, I try to cut corners and head to the police station to ask for clues for the giant technological monstrosity that razed my village to the ground and caused my technophobia while the rest of the party goes to have fun.

I get a lead about who caused the entire mess and have to wait for therest of the team to catch up to me.  Not really knowing what to do because I'm new to the game, I just decide to stay in character and begin to shout loudly about how this city is the root of all evil.

I pause, this is gonna end badly because I don't know a thing about the system.  Laughing it off, I roll the dice and get a 18 and add my charisma modifier to it, getting a 21.  The crowd starts to go along with my anger towards the government and technology.

fpo9uu,CaphireaTheBard,How's my homebrew setting?,"I'm writing a story in a homebrew setting. Basically, it's in modern day with only humans and elves on the continent that it takes place on. I might run a campaign in it at some point but right now I have no plans to. I'd like to see what you guys think, what details are missing, what seems off etc. 

 INTERRACIAL RELATIONS:

Different regions are pretty much owned by one government or the other, with northern regions being mostly occupied by high elves and southern regions mostly occupied by humans. Wood elves, while they are known to exist, don't make themselves known much and are believed by those in the know to be scattered throughout the forests that are present throughout the continent. (When elf society is mentioned throughout this, assume it's talking about high elf society unless stated not to be).

There are technically no laws in place banning interracial friendships or even romance, but they are very uncommon not only because of geographical separation and lifespan difference, but also (and most importantly) because of tension. The reasons are different for humans and elves, with most humans having a distrust for magic because of the fear of the unknown and the majority of elves feeling superior to and disregarding (even sometimes as far as to feel contempt for) human society and culture. This gets more extreme the farther from the border between where elf and humans regions meet, and less so the closer to the border. There are exceptions to this, with some feeling more fearful of or annoyed by the other society through having exposure to it. Humans are typically marginally more open-minded to elves than elves are to humans. Because of this tension:

\- No legitimate business will elves phones. It's not illegal to sell a phone to an elf, but all tech stores and most companies have a policy against it. It is possible for an elf to obtain a phone via black markets and such, but it is difficult and almost none do so because of the superiority complex.

\- Half-elves are extremely rare and the few that do exist are almost exclusively near the border. They are pretty much never accepted by elf society, and many humans also dislike them. The slurs used by bigoted elves and humans are different, with elves using ""cross-breed"" and humans using ""mutt"". Those who live where tech can be bought get flip-phones (drug-dealer phones) because no one will sell a phone to an elf.

\- It is rare and difficult for an elf to learn competently use technology and for a human to learn magic.

The way the legal system works is also different between elf and human regions, which usually isn't a problem for those not living near the border. However, near the border, the citizens bound to the legal system of their region of residence deal with some difficulties which include but are not limited to:

\- It is difficult to take legal action against the other race for something that is not a physical crime (like assault).

\- Legal interracial marriages are not possible.

\- Legal loopholes are easy to find via use of tech by an elf or magic by a human.

\- It is difficult for half-elves to be legally recognized (e.g. suing someone).

ELF AGE CHART:

Years = ""Age""

0-30 = 0-13

40 = 14

50 = 15

60 = 16

70 = 17

80 = 18

90 = 19

100-200 = 20-24

200-250 = 25

10 years per year after that

TECH:

Despite taking place in modern day, the world of The Alliance, as you have most likely gathered through magic and fantasy races being present, is not entirely like our own, even in human regions not near the border. The differences include but are not limited to:

\- All energy is renewable. Most buildings have solar panels or wind turbines and all vehicles are electric. Plastic is biodegradable.

\- Advanced technology is more common than in our world. Things like drones, 3D printers, etc. are more affordable, and streaming services are where most entertainment comes from. Mainstream TV is mainly just news.

CULTURE AND SOCIETY:

Elf:

Contrary to the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, high elves live in cities in fields and other clear areas, and are proud of their architectural prowess. They are preferential to building with marble and will sometimes compromise practicality for aesthetics. Marble statues are prevalent in nearly every significant location, in most cities, near major buildings etc.

Each elf region has a Council that acts as a government, and they cooperate among each other. Some are more powerful than others depending on the size of the region they govern. Each Council has a leader and a hierarchy beneath them, and each new leader and member is appointed by the current Council. Throughout all regions, some laws are shared along with the legal systems being similar. Among the obvious ones like theft or murder, creating a spell, especially a powerful one, without the consent of the Council is very illegal.

The two main hallmarks of elven culture are art and magic. Entwined with these is also pride, with mages and artists taking great pride in their work, and things that aren't entwined with elven culture are often frowned upon.

The vast majority of elves with a class are either wizards or clerics, and magic is strongly ingrained into elf society, with the majority of council leaders and members being powerful wizards. Nearly every school and village has at least one professional cleric, known as a Healer. Even those that don't have a class still usually learn basic spells, even beyond the cantrips granted by the system.

Elven art is the second most important part of elf society. Elf music is delicate and acoustic, with harps and violins being commonly used and bass being disregarded in exchange for intricate sounds and melodies. Marble statues are extremely commonplace, and paintings and tapestries can be found in nearly every house. Painters and sculptors, because of their elven lifespan, can and often do spend months tucked away, breathing detail into a single piece.

Human:

Human culture in the world of The Alliance is much like Western civilization, with smartphones and the internet and such. Unlike elf society, different regions have can very different culture to one another.

THE SCHOOL:

The School that the story starts out in is both a mage school for elves and and a kind of community college for humans. It is right on the border and you can see just by looking at it which side is which, with the elf side being made of marble and having statues throughout and the human side looking like a community college.

The elf side has no lights because elves have darkvision, and some of the statues within are alive.

The human side has a psychological research facility.

CHANGES TO SYSTEMS:

Some race traits are different from DnD 5e.

Elves (high and wood) get -1 to strength and are weak to bludgeoning damage. The other universal traits are the same.

Wood elf weapon training includes spears and you gain proficiency in the animal handling and survival skills. Other traits are the same.

High elves get +2 to int and two cantrips instead of one. You also gain proficiency in one skill of choice from this list: Arcana, history, investigation, religion. Other traits are the same.

A change that doesn't affect stats is that elves' skin tone is very malleable. Those who spend more time outdoors are usually darker, while those who spend more time indoors are typically paler. This isn't a perfect linear progression but it is noticeable.

Humans don't get an extra language but start out with a phone and a charger (Unless backstory would give a reason otherwise). With this, as long as you have juice and aren't in a deadzone, you can look up information, call and text, use the camera for photos and video etc. (you don't need to not be in a deadzone to use the camera).

Half-elves start out with a flip-phone unless backstory would give a reason otherwise. With this, you can call, text, and use the camera but the camera is very low-res. There is no nerfing to compensate because no one likes you. Also, unlike the handbook states, you age at half the rate of a human throughout your life.",0,1585273356,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpo9uu/hows_my_homebrew_setting/,DnD,1

fpnyby,DwarfWithoutAnAxe,Cool system for jousts,"This may seem long, but it's because I just kept pressing Enter to separate the phrases.... e\_e  


So, I'm running a homebrew campaign in an indie system called Mighty Blade (it's from Brazil, so it's completely in portuguese, sorry). But I'm gonna ""translate"" it to DnD. The characters are going to be in a banquet that reunited a lot of nobles from the hole kingdom. They decide to put up a joust conquest. Here's the system I came up with:  


**You have 3 ""slots"" and 3 things to put in them. The things are:**  
**L** \- Lance (your weapon);  
**B** \- Body (basically your torso)  
**S** \- Shield (yes, I put shields in a joust; you could use Armor instead)  


**The slots are basically how you are going to dispose them in front of your chest. Before the knights begin to speed to each other, they must throw 2d20 and assign them to different tests:**  


1- **Strength** (you can use a simple spear Attack or even Perfomance, your call);  
2 - **Animal handling** (or Acrobatics if you want);   
With that, the knights are basically going to choose what has the highest value, their Strengh of their Animal Handling. You can reroll it before every ride of keep it as it is.

**Then, confront their two dispositions of ""slots"":**  
**L x B** \- Earns the Lance owner 2 points and damages the Body owner (the Lance owner turns the weapon into shards in the Body owner's chest);  


**L x S** \- Look at the Shield's owner Strengh roll. If it is higher than the Lance owner's, nothing happens (the Lance owners hit's the other knight's shield, but he is able to stay on his horse like the brute he is...). If the Shield owner has lower Strength roll than the Lance owner, the Lance owner gains 1 point (he smashed the opponent's shield to pieces, but couldn't take him out of the horse's back).  


**L x L** \- Now, whoever has the highest Animal Handling roll earns 2 points; whoever has the lowest roll takes damage (both of them are able to strike and it's now a matter of who is able not to fall...).  


The first one to knock the adversary out or earn 5 points wins. If they earn 5 points at the same time, whoever dealt more damage wins. If that is it even... Ride again!

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Yeah, a bit complicated, I know. With an example it's going to be easier to wrap your head around it:  


Rumli and Draem decide to ride against each other! **First thing to do is to roll the tests.**  


Rumli rolls 2d20: 15 and 8. He has +3 in Animal Handling and -1 as Strengh modifier (poor Rumli). So he decides to leave it like that: 15 -1 in STR and 8 + 3 in AH.  


Draem rolls 2d20: 13 and 8. He has +2 in Animal Handling and +2 as Strengh modifier. He's tough and want's to be tough AND strong, so there's no choice to make: 13 + 2 in STR and 8 + 2 in AH.

**Rumli:** 14 STR/11 AH  
**Draem:** 15 STR/10 AH  


Now, they choose their disposition of slots (they are only going to show it to their adversary when they start riding!):  


**Rumli:** 

|**L**|**S**|**B**|
|:-|:-|:-|


**Draem:**

|B|L|S|
|:-|:-|:-|


OK! ""The trumpets play, people hold their breaths, and the knights ride!""

Now they confront their dispositions, showing them to each other. Look at the L's.   


**Rumli slams his lance against Draem's body** (L x B)!  
**Draem slams his lance against Rumli's shield** (L x S)!  


Rumli earns two points in the competion! And get's to deal damage in Draem, ouch!  
Draem has greater STR roll than Rumli... He earns 1 point, breaking the adversary's shield in half!  


The knights get new lances and shields... And make a new disposition!  
**Both of them decide not to make the rolls again...** No time to waste!  


**Rumli:**

|B|S|L|
|:-|:-|:-|


**Draem:**

|S|B|L|
|:-|:-|:-|


Again they ride! Time to confront dispositions:  


**Both Rumli and Draem were able to hit each other!** (LxL) The audience goes crazy!  


Rumli's AH is greater than Draem's! He earns 2 points and deals damage in Draem!  


*Rumli: 4 pts/0 Dmg  |  Draem: 1 pt/2 Dmg*  


Draem is almost out of breath! But keeps pushing! Rumli just smiles... They take new lances... **Time to make new dispositions.**  


**Rumli:**  


|S|L|B|
|:-|:-|:-|


**Draem:**

&amp;#x200B;

|L|B|S|
|:-|:-|:-|


  
The knights ride again... They confront dispositions:  


**Rumli breaks Draem's chestplate in a thousand pieces with this lance!** (LxB)  
**Draem can barely hold his lance, but manages to smash it against Rumli's shield!** (LxS)  


Rumli earns two more points and damages Draem even more!  
Draem has greater STR roll than Rumli... He earns 1 point, but that doesn't matter anymore...  


*Rumli: 6 pts/0 Dmg  |  Draem: 2 pts/3 Dmg*  


Since Rumli managed to earn 5 points (and a wink from the princess...), he wins! 

Draem is just a shadow of what he once was...

fpnro7,SammoSynapse,New DM/Player Looking for Advice!,"FYI: Cross post with DMAcademy

Hi all, I hope this post finds you and yours safe and healthy as can be! I have volunteered myself as DM for a virtual DnD experience, but I‚Äôve only ever played this game twice (2 homebrew one-shots); and I‚Äôve never designed or run a game. 

I am really excited about creating or adapting a story (or multiple), and I‚Äôm looking for words of wisdom and thoughts about how to not mess up. 

The party will be my siblings (x3), each of whom is well travelled in this game- including one or two regular groups they play with. They will take it easy on me and have offered to help, but I want to let them feel free to play rather than coach me as much as possible. They are all very intelligent and quick-witted, so I want to create a great adventure.

If it helps you all to know, I have access to an overwhelming amount of material through DnD Beyond:

fpnnhc,operationmason,Help reshaping my villains/world history,"I don't know if I am really satisfied with my worlds past and my villain group that arose from it. I would love your feedback, I'm only a few sessions into the campaign and its not too soon to change it as my players only have leads/effects but not causes. 

To make it short, gods shaped the planes from the chaos, created their races and beings, then limited involvement in the material plane to witness their creations bid their will in the world shaped for them.  Nations grew as did the knowledge in the arcane, mages became too powerful and started to threaten the gods power, and after one mage killed the a god (the god of death, becoming the raven queen), to protect their creations and themselves, they killed off most of the mages and created the Arcane Barrier to limit the power any person could have. Now there is an organization known as the Stratum Iconoclasts who want to break the barrier and use the arcane magic against the divine in its fullest. Then the gods greatly reduced their own power so that they would not in their battles destroy the world themselves, and began to take a more active role in the material plane and not just the outer planes. 

When the gods made the Arcane Barrier, instead of just locking magical energy away some was forced into physical manifestations throughout the material plane in three forms. It became Residuum, a silver yet iridescent liquid which would replenish spell slots, Dreg, a ebony white metal that was a byproduct of adamantine refinement that featured strong magical resistance, and Echo, a powerful magic plant with extreme regenerative and growth properties. They could be combined with proper alchemy to allow a user to temporarily bypass the Arcane Barrier. The good gods hid these manifestations deep in the world and separated them onto different continents to reduce their chance of all being found, and created an order known as the Eternal Arcanum, a group of powerful beings (mostly celestials), to protect the objects.

My players would be to fight the Stratum Iconoclasts from breaking the barrier with these items. What I don't like is that I kind of simply explained why magic cannot go above 9th level spells, or that it makes my world feel like a one time campaign I can't run any more campaigns in the future in, or the limiting elements of the past, or really just it as a whole. Is this any good, would you want to play in this, what can I change, or what do you think? I'm all for harsh criticism if you have it, and better ideas if you will offer it.",4,1585270946,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpnnhc/help_reshaping_my_villainsworld_history/,DnD,1

fpnlbe,DaBobLawBlah,"Starting a campaign with new people in PF, but I don't yet know what I'll be playing. What do you think?","These are my five ideas I've gathered so far:

- First idea is a human fighter with the Gray Maiden Initiate feat. Her name is Scarlett Carson, and she's always been fascinated with the Gray Maidens since she was a little girl. Their power, prestige, skill, honor, unity, and sheer willpower which demands respect. It's always been her dream to become one, but after having been disassembled, she seeks out their scattered clans in hopes of becoming one with their order. She fights with a longsword and spear, and wears a breastplate and heavy steel shield at first level. Eventually, I will seek out Gray Maiden Plate for her, and I have an idea for a custom weapon which is heavily inspired by Pyrrha Nikos' weapon (minus the gun).
|
- Then there's Tibjuron, my Viking inspired ranger. Tall and lean, but also strong and dextrous. He's noble and kind, but can be a serious threat when need be. Wielding a composite longbow, battleaxe, and heavy wooden shield, he is prepared for both long distance and close quarters combat. Rather than being heavily nature or animal based, he will be more focused on ranged combat, defensive tactics, and tracking and survivalism.
|
- Third is my Half-Orc Falconer (ranger). Very different than the last, Blight is more accustomed to close quarters melee combat. He has a more anime bad boy neo-samurai style. Wearing traditional eastern inspired armor, and wielding a nodachi sword. In addition to all of this, he has his trusted hawk who serves as a scout and companion. Starting out, he will have lamellar horn armor, but I intend to eventually get full mountain pattern or o-yoroi armor.
|
- Fourth up is my Dwarven Merciful Healer (cleric). Which, I will multiclass into an evocation wizard at second level. She's a crafty old woman with a twisted self-serving streak. Appearing to many as wise, old, timid, and kind...she can actually be quite wicked and inappropriate. Though she has a full name, she prefers to just be called Granny. Plus, it helps lure the unsuspecting into her grasp when others refer to her as such. After all, who would ever hurt a nice old lady? She wields a quarterstaff, and I believe I would give her a hide shirt for armor. Nothing beyond light, otherwise it would interfere with her spellcasting too much.
|
- Last but not least, there's Liam. Liam the Lion Man is a tender hearted untamed soul with a will for wandering. He wants to help others and maintain balance in the world. Merciful and helpful, he doesn't bring many implements of harm to the table. Just his trusty quarterstaff and studded leather armor. He's a Feral Shifter (druid), so he relies much more on his spellcasting and shifting / wild shaping abilities. But he seems to have a preference for creatures of the feline persuasion.

So, I would be happy to hear your thoughts and comments on these. I'm excited to play all of them, really. Some I've had as concepts for much longer than others. But at the end of the day, I will still be playing with good people, and that's what matters. If you have any suggestions, please leave them in the comments. I love discussion, and I would greatly appreciate any tips and tricks you can provide.

fpmvhn,Luperdye,[5e] A few questions about stealth and hiding,"Firstly, please don't respond with ask your DM, he doesn't know either. We're all new to the game, it's our first campaign. (Unless it's up for interpretation, then please specify that.)

After hours of googling I find stealth still very vague and have a few questions I'm not sure about, cause it's getting frustrating.

Before combat:

When combat starts only being hidden grants you the surprise mechanic right (which means we get a free turn and just that)? So if I'm unseen behind a tree but didn't choose to do the stealth check (yet), only my party members who did may participate in this free turn? And I can't make use of surprise on my next turn, only once per party per encounter right? Also if I fail the stealth check I'm automatically detected? And can the DC change depending on what the enemies are doing, or is it always their passive perception?

During combat:

So I first must become unseen to attempt to hide which already grants me advantage on attacks and disadvantage on me right? So literally the only thing I get extra from using an action to hide is that I can move around (without entering line of sight with enemy) without me having to roll again and enemies won't know I'm moving around. Cause if I move while only being unseen, enemies will always know where I am from sound etc. So that's literally the only benefit I can get out of my stealth skill during combat? Sounds kinda weak, because if I pop my head out to shoot I lose advantage and hidden status (unless DM rules enemy is too distracted?). And missing always gets me out of hide no matter what. And can I decide to sneak up to an enemy to do a melee attack with advantage, what is the DC?

Outside of combat:

If I'm sneaking past enemies, is the DC still always their passive perception or can the DM make a number up like with other things? Because it's harder to sneak behind an enemy on active guard than 2 bandits talking at a campfire which is again harder than sneaking past a sleeping enemy. So what tools does the DM have, can it only impose advantage, disadvantage or add bonuses to rolls?

fpmrjd,Onewhoknowsnaught,Traumatized character and leaving the party,"Hi all! I hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy!

Now, the topic at hand. I've been playing in this campaign for over a year now and many things have happened along the way. Our characters have been bombarded with failure after failure or threat after threat, and so on. I hate how this is going to make me sound but I can't help but feel that only I am adequately role-playing my characters reaction to all the crap we endured

 Our team consists of:

-a minotaur barbarian/cleric- whose stupidity is worthy of being immortalized in one of the greentexts unfortunately the horror ones(he endangered us many times, and attacked my character on several occasions when he lacked arguments in a discussion) 

-a halfelf warlock who recently joined and we don't know anything about her yet

-a sewer moon druid who just kinda doesn't care and his player tends to have issues with me(more on that later)

-and my character, a human artificer/cleric/wizard(I went for a weird combo) who lost her legs and replaced them with her construct servant

She is the brains of the group and the main source of any knowledge our party has of anything since the others are not very knowledgeable. For some time now I've felt like she's the only one that really changes through our adventures. When one of the characters a paladin(played by the guy who has issues with me) died got resurrected and then got us into trouble we argued in character, however the player thought I as a person insulted him as a person using my character. Which made him throw a tantrum, insult me some more, try to tell me that I did something I did not and so on. That's just a background. Since that time he rejoined as another character the aforementioned druid. And we ventured on. We all nearly died a couple of times, my character was an inch from death when she saved the others by risking her life in noxious fumes. We uncovered a giant cult which was a very real and very far reaching threat. We have been mistaken for fugitives and chased, the party abandoned my character in a city full of soldiers searching for us for a night. A library my character searched for turned out to have been destroyed and its guardian a sphinx bullied us into making a deal with him and helping him in some grand quest while he took parts of our souls in case we tried to do something he didn't like. Then we went on an errand he gave us and got knocked out of the sky straight into feywild. There some elements that preceeded the paladins death and departure coincidentally repeated but my character saw them as history repeating itself and surely it kinda did. The barbarian this time started to act very hostile. Then we found the old paladin(now an npc) who spent the last 30, years for him, and a bit more than a month for us, here. He seemed a lot more chill than he was and actually made my character relax. We decided to save him and went on to rob the local fey queen. Pally and I were supposed to distract the queen while the others rummaged through her Chambers in search for an important item which needed to be destroyed. Then my character got Feebleminded. Her greatest strength gone and she reduced to a sorry state that spell creates. The pally teleported us out of there and then bound her to the ground so she wouldn't try to follow him back. Right now she's on the ground, without her construct prosthesis, since that didn't get teleported, bound by vines not understanding a single thing apart from that her friend is once again leaving her.

I think that that amount of failure and nasty shit happening to one already vulnerable person would definitely cause some damage especially the memories of being feebleminded. But I don't know in what way really. Does she quit altogether and leave to come back home? Does she go on a crazy quest to fortify her mind using aberrations as inspiration(eating mind flsyer brains, making items out of aboleths or beholdera meant to make her smarter etc), while slowly creating her own organization of informants apprentices of crafts and magic around her? Or should I just ignore it like all the others seemingly do? The druid player basically told me that I'm the one traumatizing my character and creating problems for myself for no reason. That whole conversation was weird since I think he tried to teach me how to role-play but as he though it should be done? Basically change my play style into his. 

So I don't really know what to do. I really like this character but I want to stay true to what she would do even if it means letting her go, and making a new character who as my druid-playing colleague does doesn't care.

I'm sorry for the chaotic way this is written. What I basically want to know are your opinions on the matter. What would you do? Have you ever had a situation similar to this one? How do you deal with groups that don't seem to care about some stuff like that? 

TL;DR My character is having a really bad time and I don't know whether to show it by mental trauma or not, while my fellow players don't really care about that kind of stuff and one of them is trying to make me change my play style because he thinks I'm doing something wrong.

_____________________

class: warlock (fiend patron)

race: dragonborn (black dragonborn)

characteristics: reckless, some what good hearted, kind of crazy,have a tendency to cuase troubles, hate clerics and paladins with a burning passion.

backstory:

______________________
life spet at him and his family for as long as he remembered, almost everywhere he went problems followed, and many tragedies came to his family and their farm. and one day a crusade full of powerful paladins burned down the village because, ""heretics"", like his family....

 and after the carnage he escaped the village, but he lost everything, and even his sentiy was crumbling due to the horror of seeing his family, friends and his decade of research (he was a sage),burned before his eyes....

and decided to do the unthinkable.... he sacrificed his soul to a fiend* in order to get revenge on the paladins. and revange he got as he destroyed the Paladin's home town.

and now, insane, powerful and reckless he became a ""false hero"" , a guy who will murder a shopkeeper and his family to feed a random homeless, a guy who will spit acid on someone's face to get them out of a coma,a guy who will burn an orphanage to force people to adopt the children,a guy who will make an army of ducks just because, a guy who will make insane solutions to a simple problem.

he think he is a hero with a golden heart but he is just insane. 

for summary, he decided to say ""fuck it"" to everything, and so he did.
_____________________________

and oh boy that fiend that my warlock is working for is mine and the DM's biggest joke so far. because he is based of 80's ""cool dudes"" dont-do-drugs commercials. but he is a story for a different time, maybe.
______________________________

so what do you guys think about my 1st character? and if you think its to edgy, tell me, because he is supposed to be more ""reckless and redicouls"" then ""edge EDGE *EDGE*""",4,1585267199,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpmo3l/i_created_a_character_for_my_1st_campaign_and_i/,DnD,1

The guards are from more than just the area and regional government. As that regional government is controlled by a massive empire spans a little over a thousand miles. But that empire is a later fish to fry.

2. With running Ghosts of Saltmarsh, I can buy the campaign on Roll20 and get all of the preset things, is this worth it? I have the physical book, and I am wanting to do some things outside of the main chapters to try and tie together a whole story (focused around the Scarlet Brotherhood, the Final Enemy chapter, and the Hag in the Dreadwood), will this hinder my ability to do so? 
3. Are there any other videos/sites that people recommend to watch? I am watching the video by Hollow Tale about Roll20 and that is very useful.

For instance death saves and low level ressurection spells make permadeath very rare, encumbrance rules being erased leave no thought to what people should pack, certain low level spells wholly erase survival based stuff and essentially nerf the living hell out of the usefulness of rangers, and dozens of other mechanics basically eliminate the entire playstyle of survival and careful packing/planning being needed.

This will be my first Campaign I've run. I've been playing frequently for about a year and a half now, and I've DM'ed a couple one shots. 

Plot:
Long ago there was only one existance Eon. The planes weren't fractured like they are now. If one could walk through the Ethreal Mists without losing their mind, you could walk from the city Elysium to Hades and the rest. The gods of these cities however war over the space between seeking contol of the land and inhabitants. Only the Ethreal Mists and a baren wasteland scared by the elements lies between these cities. This wasteland is all that is left of the Cradle of Life. 

An uprising has begun. Whispers of a way to get rid of all the gods at once; to rid Eon of their wanton destruction. If the Aether could be destroyed then all magic and life sustained by it would cease. All of the gods would either die or become powerless. A small but very powerful band of creatures has begun searching out a way to destroy the Aether. 

You are the resistance. You are among those who believe magic is redeemable. That maybe there is another way to restore the land of Eon, the Cradle of Life and it's inhabitants. That the ends do not justify the means. Killing the inoccent life of all those sustained by magic is not justifiable by killing the gods. Or maybe you yourself enjoy the power that comes with magic, and wish to not be stripped of it. Whatever your reasoning, you are opposed to those who seek to end magic itself. 

Tah-Da! 

There will be some modifications to spells that have to deal with the extra dimensional or movement between dimensions. I want to stay as true to 5e as I can, but I am totally down with homebrew. 

Per the D&amp;D dimensional map if you will. There will be a city named after the plane that corespinds with each alignment, and a deity(or more) that fit the alignment of that dimension who rule the city. Creatures who enter these cities must make a CON save to turn (good, neutral or evil) to match the city and a WIS save to not turn (lawful, neutral, chaotic) to match the city. Upon exiting a city creatures will revert to their natural alignment. This will impact roleplay and decision making heavily. 

All along the way the protagonists (players) will see the same destruction and events that have made the uprising seek to destroy magic, and have to make moral decisions along the way. In the end they may choose to end magic themselves (who knows!). 

Surpise twist! If the antagonists complete their goal of assembling an artifact they think will destroy the Aether, what will actually happen is the fracturing of Eon into different dimensions not the elimination of magic. These antagonists and protagonists then become the first planeswalkers of the multiverse.

Questions I have: 

Is there a pantheon of gods that contain a deity of each alignment? Should I just pick gods that fit? Or make up my own pantheon? 

Do you foresee any plot holes that I should patch up? 

Are there any spells or abilities I should be aware of that may effect this world design poorly?",5,1585261271,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpl0qe/plot_idea_for_new_campaign_seeking_help/,DnD,1

fpkw4b,SkellieBoi,I need some help making a full-proof contract with a Dao genie,"I have been having a lot of trouble with my most recent idea for my character in D&amp;D so I decided to ask for help. This is my first time ever using reddit so I'm very excited to see what this community has to say.

To provide a little backstory I am currently a player in a mostly home-brew D&amp;D style of playing and our characters don't go on typical campaigns. There is a lot of world building through players involved and this current world we're playing in is only about 2 years old so it is still in it's infancy when it comes to infrastructure and other things akin to that. PC's are constantly influencing the world (for better or for worse,) and currently one PC has accidentally incited a war between our biggest city (which is mostly elves,) and copper dragons. I am incredibly nervous about this because from the looks of it we are not going to make it out of this war. This city is the biggest on the continent as well as the central hub to many characters and stories. My character especially has a very comfortable roll in this city, being a high ranking personnel to the Empress. I am trying to avoid this war by any means necessary, and my character has just recently found a Dao genie. I know Dao's are evil and shifty which is why I need to make my wishes airtight.   


The character who incited the war is partially being controlled by some kind of outer god, and the DM makes rolls to see when he will seize control. In this particular instance the character visited the copper dragon kingdom as they are half copper dragon. They did not get the etiquette right with meeting with the king and was sent away. The DM, seeing how this got the player upset decided to roll to see if the outer god would take over based on the player's emotional state. He rolled successfully, and when the player was under DM control the DM as the outer god proceeded to kill 3 copper dragons. The player, instead of going back to their city fled and no one knows where they are. The other player that was with him went back to their city and told the Empress and his family what happened. I should also note these two players are part of the most highest ranking nobility family in the city. With some failed negotiations between the copper dragons and the city's council a war is about to begin. I came up with the idea to use this genie to attempt to prevent the war. I am, however very nervous on how this will play out as I don't want this to backfire and make things worse.  


My wishes are as follows:  


1. I wish that the King of the Copper Dragons will accept (character name) of (city name) as a full peace offering from (city name), ending possibility of any war between us now or at any point in the future.  

2. I wish that (character name) was teleported to the Copper Dragon kingdom prison alive, with the copper dragons knowing her presence is on (city name's) behalf, with no way to escape, and no way to cause damage or hurt anyone or anything while she's there.  

3. I wish that all of (city name) and it's people except for (character name) were completely immune to copper dragon acid indefinitely. (This is my failsafe)  
Please comment with any suggestions on how to improve this and make it more solid. If you have any questions about anything I'll be happy to answer

fpkt3n,Fahlnor,Can you help flesh out my character concept?,"Hi, all!

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently been working on a character concept I'd like some feedback on, be that comments or thoughts on what I've got worked out so far or suggestions for changes or developments.

Disclaimer: I'm extremely tired writing this and struggling to form coherent sentences. I've written and re-written sections of this so many times the screen is starting to blur.

&amp;#x200B;

**Class**: Barbarian (Path of the Ancestral Guardian)

**Race**: Mountain Dwarf

**Stat priority**: Con --&gt; Str --&gt; Dex --&gt; Wis --&gt; Cha --&gt; Int

**Concept**: The only thing more important to a Dwarf than his clan is his honour. If a Dwarf is ever shamed, it not only brings disgrace on himself, but also on his family and hold. Thus, the honour of a Dwarf is the honour of his clan.

It often happens that a Dwarf will vow a mighty oath before Muradin, pledging to complete some task or service to his God. Dwarves who have sworn such an oath will bind their lives to the vow and - although uncommon - it is not unheard of for a Dwarf to die pursuing his goals. Rarer still, however, are those Dwarves who swear an oath and ultimately break fealty with the promise they have forged. *Oathbreaker*, they are named, and their shame burns through the clanhold.

In some clans, an Oathbreaker might be exiled, turned away from hearth and home to wander the wilds until they redeem themselves in a suitably heroic death. In this clan however, an Oathbreaker is instead sent to serve in the Temple of the Ancients, never to leave the shrine unless he is Chosen by the spirit of some forebear whose death left a vow unfulfilled.

An Oathbreaker's life is no longer theirs to live. From the day he enters the Temple until the day he dies, his sole purpose is to serve as a vessel for the spirits of his ancestors and to seek redemption by completing the vow that they swore. To that end, Oathbreakers' minds are focused through intense meditation and moulded into a space of great peace and calm - a harbour which might serve to shelter the clan's fallen. Clerics will train their charges to withstand great hardship, pushing the Oathbreaker's body to the breaking point - and sometimes beyond. Their martial training will focus on defence and protection, to better ensure their body might be equal to whatever task comes to them.

When the spirit of a fallen ancestor finds its way back to the hold, it is possible that it will accept the offer formed by the open mind of an Oathbreaker: an opportunity to complete their sworn task and to aid their shamed kin in seeking redemption. The spirit will meld with that of the Oathbreaker, who will now be known as *Chosen* and can start their first steps towards atonement. The spirit ancestor will augment the hardened body of the Chosen with its own experience and combat skills as the two leave their mountain fastness for one final journey.

**Thoughts**: I like the idea of a Dwarf Barbarian who fights with spear and shield (or crossbow) until the going gets tough, at which point he rages (representing the ancestor spirit pushes to the fore) and draws the massive mace/great sword on his back. The Dwarf himself isn't entirely competent with the larger weapon (which maybe acts as a focus of some sort - perhaps the weapon is a relic belonging to the ancestor spirit) and focuses on keeping his shield between him and any enemies until it's clear he's in real danger.

The ancestor spirit gives some golden roleplay opportunities. There's no reason the spirit wouldn't have a totally different personality which might occasionally come out in social situations. There is also a whole load of scope to speak with the DM about what the ancestor's vow was (maybe the Dwarf doesn't actually consciously know?) and about what caused him to fall from grace as an Oathbreaker.

I feel like there's a kernel of something really awesome here, but I'm currently playing my first ever campaign and have got to the heady heights of level 4, so having some more experiences players give feedback would be massively appreciated!

fpkmrz,Slumblebum,Applying effects to Artificer's Repeating Shot?," (Apologies, I had deleted my earlier post and moved it into the Questions thread, but it seems like creating a post might be more appropriate for this kind of question. If a mod would like to point me in the direction of this subs preferences regarding this sort of thing, I would be all ears. Thank you and apologies again)

I am very new to DnD (this is my first campaign) and I am loving it so far. Last night, as I was leveling my Grung artificer, I came across a small conundrum that I thought I would toss out into the ether for fun.

Using the infusion ""Repeating Shot"" autoloads and fires a single magical piece of ammunition into a ranged weapon. Using this effect, would I theoretically have an opportunity to apply an effect to the ammunition prior to firing it? I am trying to rationalize it in my head and I guess it comes down to whether the weapon fires like a double action revolver, in that as you pull the trigger the ammunition moves into the chambered position, or is it more like a semiautomatic in that the next piece of ammunition is chambered automatically upon firing the previous round?

I would contend that if the action it like that of the semi automatic, a pc would have an opportunity to apply an effect (such as using poison secretion to poison the ammunition) prior to firing, where as if the action is closer to that of the double action, you would have to make the choice of loading the effected ammunition prior to firing the weapon.

This is a question that I will ultimately pose to my DM for ruling and I could really go either way. Obviously I'd love for him to give me the opportunity to do as much damage as possible, but I could see where this kind of stacking could be unwanted. LMK, I'd love to hear your opinions.

My DM messeged me that our next sesseion would start at lvl 7 and I thought I could use that pretty high level to ad a bunch of backstory about one or two characters and here I want to introduce you to......

KASH'TYR SPINERIPPER (Tabaxi) 
It's a tabaxi fighter with a unusual backround:
His ""parents"" found him as a young kitten left behind as his parents died/had to flee of an attak from an orc tree.
The overlord of the tribe decided to keep him as a pet, since he didn't know this cheetah looking thing was a humanuid intelligent crature.
His wife, a wood efl who fell in love with the tribe boss after she saw he had a love for the nature in their habitat, recoized on the first look that Kash'Tyr wasn't the pet her husband thought of.
She intervented her husband to let him grow up with their ""family"", but since Kash'Tyr wasn't the strongest kid in the tribe his mother thougth him that his speed is his best weapon and he used that to mess with other tribe members to gain respect.
His older stepbrother, from the tribe members first wife, loved him and nerver had a doubt in him since they grew up together, but as Kash'Tyr grew older their father hasn't been satisfied because he was a better fighter than his own son.
So eventually his father threw out his own son who had a hard goodbye with his mother.
Kash'Tyr then moved with some coins his mother gave him to the next city and made his living by showfights and robbing people. He never lost his believe in mankind but he had to make his living.
One day a mystereous stranger came to him and was willing to pay him money for doing things for him. It started with little thefts an ended with assassanating people. He did everything just to survive, but as he never saw his giver because he always used telepathation to comunicate with him and everytime he successfully had a growing force awakening in him, he thought there could be something more...




As many experienced people recognize.. I'm talking about an tabaxi that is a born fighter who later turned into an assassin rouge with the potential to build a warlock to.
I took it short because i did't want to take your imagination to built it as you like.
I'm planning to play this character and I'm very exited about it.

fpk20a,HighTechnocrat,How to Play Online: A Megathread.,"With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, and lockdowns/quarantines of varying degrees taking place around the world, more people than ever are turning to playing their DnD games online. This thread is intended to serve as an official subreddit response to answer questions about how to move your game from in person to online, but players looking to start new games may also find this thread helpful if they want to start an online-only game.

## What You Need

### Computers &amp; Connections

Every player will need a computer that can connect to the internet. The hardware needs are modest, so anything can run Skype should suffice. You will need a stable internet connection, and if you choose to use video to see other players you may need to worry about bandwidth, especially during peak usage periods throughout the day.

### Voices &amp; Videos

You will need a microphone of some kind (unless you want to play by typing everything), and optionally a webcam. These don't need to be spectacular, but obviously better audio and video quality can improve the experience. If you have a smart phone, that may be sufficient.

You will also need something to connect everyone. It's essentially conference call, so anything that can handle group phone calls will work.

Some examples are listed below. This is not a personal or official endorsement of any of these products; the subreddit and its moderators have no relationship, personal or professional, with anyone associated with these products. 

* Discord
* FaceTime
* Skype
* Slack
* Zoom

### Tabletops &amp; Tokens

If you play by ""theater of the mind"", audio/video of the other players is sufficient. If your group uses a map, tokens, etc. you will need a ""virtual tabletop"" to replicate that capability.

Here is a small list of virtual tabletop options with an extremely brief summary of their merits. Again: no affiliation with the products, etc. etc. you get the point, we're not making money off of this.

* [Fantasy Groumds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/home.php): A long-standing player in the virtual tabletop market. Requires purchase up front, but free after that. Needs to be installed on each player's computer.
* [roll20](https://roll20.net/): Robust, free, and runs in a browser with a premium subscription that adds stuff like dynamic lighting and dynamic lines of sight. Has built-in audio and video, but it's not great so most people use a separate audio/video solution in conjunction with roll20.
* [Tabletop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/): Simulates playing at a table. I haven't used it so I can't speak to specifics, but please comment below if you can provide a brief description.

Please inform me if you know of or use other virtual tabletops so that I can expand this list.

## Conclustion

As a personal request: Please stay safe. Practice social distancing, wash your hands, and don't touch your face. Consider washing your dice using household cleaners like a bleach solution or isopropyl alcohol (60% concentration or higher). (Please don't ruin your dice, though. I don't know how whatever weird mammoth bone material your dice are made from will react to any given liquid.)

Even if you don't get to continue your game for a while, check in with your friends frequently. Staying isolated can be emotionally taxing for a lot of people, and maintaining social relationships without face to face contact is difficult. Get people together to play board games or video games online, even if it's just one-on-one and even if it's just for a few minutes.",79,1585258035,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpk20a/how_to_play_online_a_megathread/,DnD,5
fpk1gb,that-1-fella,First-Timers character creation help (5e),"I'm sorry if this is formatted wrong or not the right place for this kind of question! So I have never played d&amp;d before but I've always had an interest in it and it's worldspace. Recently, I moved and made friends with a group who is also interested in playing it and we only have our DM as someone who has played before. This is a fun quirky group with no one being too serious but everyone is excited to roleplay. Our DM had asked us to roll for stats before choosing anything about our character. He wants us to come back to him later this week with a fleshed-out character including race, alignment, backstory, class.

My rolled stats were:
S - 18
D - 8
C - 14
I - 6
W - 15
C - 16

I don't want to do just a dumb barbarian, I want to have more deapth that I can role-play into. I kind of like the idea of a chaotically good orc warpriest who is into a really violent religion but believes he is healing people by punching the bad blood out of them. I was just curious to know what everyone's thoughts on how to role-play with these stats or for fun things I can do. And since I don't know all of the rules or all of the story I wanted to ask this community since I only have a couple of days to come up with something. Again sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, hope everyone is staying safe!",3,1585257984,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpk1gb/firsttimers_character_creation_help_5e/,DnD,2

fpjsob,pcaramel,The Anomaly,"Here goes a weird concept for a character for dnd 3.5: Allen the Anomaly: Allen is a 16 years old level one human commoner (with npc ability scores and all, although with little to no charisma since hes shy and quiet, rather high inteligence and particularly high wisdom) who sees himself dragged to a journey, however Allen has a bizarre powe: he levels up based on his class level +1 rather than his character level, so the more he multiclasses the faster he will level up, although he only gets bab, hit die, brb and skillpoints from 3 classes each, also his ability scores only each 8 levels instead of 4 (although he does get a extra feat each 4 levels as normal) and he gets the full b√¥nus from his commoner levels, prestige classes level up based on his class level +5, epic prestige classes level up based on his class level +20. The exp rewards he gets along with other things that are usually based on character level like his challenge rating are based instead on his hit die. While this character woud probably eventually become crazy overpowered, he starts incredibly weak, making a lot of room for character development.

fpiyqq,DarthJuyo,Creative spell casting,"Greetings! My only question I had is as the title suggests, what is the some of the best creative ways to use spells in and out of combat. I'll give the first example with my character. I play a trickery cleric with a little bit of sorcerer multiclassing. During a combat against some moving suits of armor while everyone else was doing outright damage or helping others in the combat my character took a few turns to instead of dealing a measly d8 of damage or more decided to create water on the ground around the enemies. No one said anything at first, my guess they were wondering what I was doing, as the second round came to my turn I asked the dm if I could use my ray of frost to noe freeze the water my target was standing in and freeze their feet to the floor. Dm allowed it saying I'll allow this to restrain the target for 1 whole round. Most said it was a good idea while others said nothing but I wasnt done yet. As my turn came in the third round of combat I found a rock the dm said was somewhere around 50 lbs and proceed to max range dimension door into the sky, dropping the rock on the restrained target who auto failed as their feet were frozen to the ground. I simply casted featherfall after and calmly floated down as I watched my rock obliterate this suit of armor. Dont know how the Dm came up with the damage if he arbitrarily threw out how many d6 it did or he calculated it somehow but regardless, in 3 rounds I took out a fairly high cr enemy in one attack with just 3 rounds of set up. Everyone was stunned while I was happily counting my loot and xp.

fphrjf,Ice_dragon54,I seduced a hostile demon.,"So I'm playing on a Ravnica rp server and in the encounter we were going against creatures from hell and on the 3rd wave the ""Arrester"" That we where fighting against turned into a demon(from the characters perspective but he was just pretending) and after a little while in the fight we know we'll win we were just out of steam. So not wanting it to go on longer I rolled to seduce the demon (my character is gay) and got a 13 but with my seduction skills I still seduced him and to seal off the deal he used a spell  on me to kill one of my teammates which was the Azorius arrester. 

So I did and sadly didn't kill him but the group ganged up on him besides me and he was knocked unconscious and after some rp the arrester I was supposed to kill tales him away and now I'm planning on breaking him out of New Prahv (the guildhall) which will also probably give me the death penalty whenever I get captured sooo yeah.

fphm8q,Doomwaffel,[3.5e- Rule question] - Starting an encounter - assassin,"I always found the Encounter rules very lackluster in 3.5e, but its what I am stuck with for now. Personally as a DM I rarely ever use spot/listen for starting an encounter.  


But I would like to check on something specific:  
Let's say a Rogue/Assassin tries to move his way through a dungeon/castle. He moves silently and tries to stay hidden.  


1) Does he always have to stay behind cover to be hidden or just to start hiding? Can he move unseen once he made a hide check? Or would he have to run from 1 cover place to the next?  
2) Let's say he finds 2 guards and wants to kill one of them. How would you go about this? Assuming they always fail their spot checks, can he move up to them, stay unseen, wait 1 round (or 3 for death attack) and then melee 1?  
3) Does he automatically become visible once he attacked one? Can he attack and move back into a hiding spot to not be seen?  


Or does he have to stay behind cover and hope that 1 of them comes close enough so that he can get close enough in 1 move? ... Sounds strange since he still would only have 1 action for a surprise round so he cant move out of his hiding place AND attack unless he wins the ini as well, but then he will be seen.  


How exactly does this work in practice? How would an assassin attack and stay hidden from the 2nd guard? Or event get to the 1 without hinging it on the ini?  


Thanks in advance.",5,1585249945,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fphm8q/35e_rule_question_starting_an_encounter_assassin/,DnD,1
fphfqm,omgitsmattiep,I Suplexed a Dragon,"So my party (all level 7) and I were out in this blighted field and get attacked by 3 white dragons. We have a Scriptorii wizard, an Aasimar warlock, a Shifter ranger, a Human fighter, a Firbolg druid, and my Air Genasi monk.

We in almost in over our heads. Two of the dragons let out a cold breath attack, almost knocking me out and taking our warlock from full health to being KO‚Äôd. While my party divided to take on 2 dragons, I ran after another one flying in the air because I have winged boots. It took some maneuvering but I finally managed to get above it and grappled one of its wings. After it‚Äôs flight was interrupted, we plummeted to the ground and because I have the slow fall ability, took no damage while the dragon took 2d6 falling damage.

By the time this was done, my party had managed to kill the other two and I had almost died twice (thank you healers) from hanging on to my grapple. Finally the dragon flew straight up 180 feet (using the dash action) and I lost my grapple check and fell to the ground, taking 63 falling damage. My slow fall helped enough to knock me unconscious rather than outright kill me, but I still can‚Äôt get the image of my character suplexing a dragon out of the air out of my head üòÇ",14,1585249363,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fphfqm/i_suplexed_a_dragon/,DnD,4

fphco9,Necronam,Interpreting Differences in Spell Effect Wording,"I tend to be a stickler for RAW, both as a DM and as a player. That's not say I'm not open to discussions or different interpretations, but if something can generally be reasoned, I'll allow it. 

What sparked this post is the party Cleric. The wording on some Cleric spells has a pretty distinct difference that, after discussing things, I'm considering allowing, even though it seems unintentional. 

For example, the extreme majority of spells that can target specify ""that you can see within range"". However, the spell Spike Growth (Nature Domain) only specifies ""on a point within range"", with the difference being you don't need to have direct LoS. The Cleric wanted to cast this spell inside a building that was full of enemies, even though they had no LoS into the building. I allowed it, primarily because it just happened to be a rundown temple of their patron deity, but now oom wondering if LoS is ever required. There are other spells, like Clairvoyance that specify ""or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you"". Since Spike Growth doesn't specify either, I feel like it could be reasoned both ways. 

Another minor wording clarification, spells like Spirit Guardians specify ""when the creature enters the area for the first time on *a turn* **or** *starts its turn there*"". This implies it triggers damage both on casting (or if the Cleric moves into range) as well as the start of the affected enemies' turn. 

How would you interpret these?",16,1585249090,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fphco9/interpreting_differences_in_spell_effect_wording/,DnD,5

fph07c,Doctor_Ander,I need nihilistic phrases for my Big Bad Evil Guy. Can you help me out?,"So. I run a Campain where the bbeg is a consultant for the duke Heinrich of Idstein. The duke is a dumb human, who begun a war with the dwarves from the Dumathoinsmine 7 years ago.  The consultant is named Richard (I'm German, so I use for Humans German names. Sorry for typos). Richard advises the Duke Heinrich for War and foreign policy. But the Duke has not listened to Richard, so the Duke lost. Hard.

And Richard lost his only son.

And Richard wants revenge. Revenge on the Duke and on the dwarves. And in his seek for revenge he made a pact with Yeenoghu (Mordenkainen p155) and he breed up a pack of gnolls. Richard has sent a spy, who will destroy the gates of the Dumathoinsmine. The gnolls will get omens from Yeenoghu that shall lead them to the mine. In the same time Richard will kill the other consultants of the Duke and the duke himself.

So, that's the plan.

Richard has fallen to the lure of Yeenoghu and has  has the spell  ""Vicious Mockery"", because  I really like the concept of this spell and I want my players to feel Richard's insanity. It came across to me because I would love Richard to get into their heads. No long, big speech, but in every combat round Richard should have a little phrase, in which he disturb the party a little. The best way to do that would be nihilism, in my opinion. But I am absolutely not nihilistic, quite the opposite, actually.

fpfyt9,Gnomefort,Monk ability/feat planning help!,"Hi all! Super excited to be playing my first 5E campaign. I've decided to play a monk and am trying to plan out my abilities and feats. There are so many I want to take but it seems like ability scores are probably a bit more important given the lack of other means to acquire AC. Anyway, I was looking for some advice, as I have a couple different scenarios I could go with. My started dex / wis will either be:

18 dex
16 wis

or

19 dex
17 wis

--

I was thinking of going 19dex / 17wis and then using the level 4 and 8 feat selections to choose feats that also either give +1dex or +1wis. However, part of me thinks it might be wiser to just either dump points into abilities until I can at least get dex to 20 or maybe instead take the ""Mobile"" feat and then go all ability points. Mobile seems like such a good fit. I haven't 100% decided which order to go with yet but I was leaning heavily towards Drunken Master.

For extra context, it is a three person party and we do not have a pure tank or a pure healer (gonna be interesting!).

fpfou7,Sigma-Iota-Rho,Running a City as a player in D&amp;D,"My D&amp;D group is running a home brew campaign, and my character, CE (was formerly LE, but more on that later),is trying to seize power in the central polis. The two major rivers flow through it and it is geographically in the middle of the continent. It also happens to be a hotbed for criminal organizations and smuggling with a government that is powerless to stop it. My character sees an opening to work on taking power for himself, so he uses his magic which I selected to be centered around deception and political intrigue. After disguising himself as the city librarian, my character charms the patrician into signing laws that although powerless would cause an uproar in the criminal underground because evidently somebody is trying to rip power away from them. My character then suggests that the patrician go to bed and then kills him to create a power vacuum. I did this to create chaos in the city and start a civil war in the city with the criminal underground (this is why I got an alignment change). But my hopes are to get the people who suffer at the hands of the criminal organizations to realize what is going on and see that they have been screwed over by these gangs. The city relies almost completely on smuggling and trade from criminals. I have sent a party of anarchists that we met while out somewhere else to the city in order to tell the people how awful these criminals are to them and to shake up the public with public executions and attacks. I want the people to get caught in the crossfire. I was thinking that in the midst of the chaos, my character would swoop in making promises of a better city by upping the police force and other democratic things in order to seize control and inevitably turn the place into a dictatorship. How do you think I should continue going about this? I am only a far as sending the anarchists to the city to make a splash, so any thought about how I should carry on would be much obliged. I have read Greene‚Äôs the 48 laws of power and the 33 rules of war, but I thought I would ask the D&amp;D community what they thought. What other actions should I take to get a stronger grip on the city? Nobody there knows that I am pulling any strings and my character wears a mask that hides his identity, so I have stayed behind the scenes watching as the condition of the city deteriorates. How long should I wait until I jump in promising to fix things? There are three major gangs and I hope to squeeze each of them out eventually in order to have sole control of the place.

fpezgj,Pestell,Wrestling names as NPC‚Äôs,"I sometimes find that coming up with npc names on the fly can be difficult, but as a fan of professional wrestling, I will often pull their names out as a quick on the fly option.  Everyone I have ever played with doesn‚Äôt watch wrestling, which means their names work fantastic.  A lot of the wrestlers names are very unique and memorable, and usually I will pull small personality traits from the wrestlers themselves so that if character comes back up in play, I can remember what they were like with name recognition alone.  Usually I will pull from North American Wrestling establishments, but sometimes I will grab a name from a Japanese or Mexican Company for some flavour.  

Hope this helps anyone!

PS.  I feel like this could work with other fantasy shows and movies, or things like anime, but I would think that as a PC if I met a character name Gandalf, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to think of anybody but the known wizard, but if I pull out a name like Damian Priest, Aleister Black, or Ember Moon, to a non-wrestling fan, they just sound like cool names.

fpessg,venkelos1,Laying Siege - A World Filled With Magic,"One of my favorite elements of D&amp;D is the magic that fills it up, but sometimes I run into circumstances, and it gets incredibly annoying when it results in arguments with other people, where that magic is just too prevalent, and one has to wonder why certain things ever happen. Classic examples involve death and injury; if many cities have powerful churches, with clerics, then they have some access to mid-to-high-level divine magic. A noble need never grow sick, or lose an heir, because there are spells for that. Curses are problematic, but easily enough fixed, with similar magic, if you can get to it, and it doesn't specifically say it takes something stronger. Needless to say, it can sometimes be irritating to write a compelling story when there can obviously be such ""easy fixes"" around. ;)

The one I want to address here, though, is a little bit different. I'm writing a story where the main character; a Drow Mage noble ousted from her city, wants to seek revenge against it. One of the things one might want to do to bring a city low is hit it with sickness; I can't argue recent real-life events might've influenced this element. Problem: while we might find ourselves debilitated IRL by a virus, currently, it's easily fixed in the game world, and if there is one thing no Drow city should find itself short on, its priestesses. Any effort to weaken the city, and possibly the image of the Spider Queen, along with it, will be immediately stymied by the overabundance of divine casters in it. I could argue that perhaps Drow being CE, some might refrain from healing/remedying others, as weakness isn't tolerated, and spite runs rampant, but once the city starts to weaken, and the enemies outside start to take note, even these callous clerics will put aside personal things for survival.

Obviously, there are many people, in and out of the world, who would want to topple the Drow cities, and bring the monsters low, and the fact that they don't, even when the Drow themselves are so cruel, and self-destructive, speaks to how hard such an objective would be to achieve, how might one go about it? How could you attack a city filled with clerics, supported by mages, and with enough well-trained soldiers to fend off the militant Duergar, corrupting Illithids, and other denizens of the Underdark?

What About Converting Wrath Of The Immortals?  (Would that be easy to convert to 2E or 3E?)

HMMM...A NOTE:-

It's strange how the nowadays underappreciated BECMI line was meant to be non-""Advanced"", but had more advanced rules in the core boxed sets / the later Cyclopedia + WOTI than in any core ""AD&amp;D"" rulebook, certainly in the reign of 2nd Ed.

These advanced BECMI rules explained in more detail how to handle things that many roleplayers dream of --- to wit, IIRC, at higher levels...

\---exploring then settling land as a lord;

\---attracting followers etc;

\---paying to build err buildings e.g. castles;

\-&amp;-

\---administrating or ruling one's resultant domain.

Then there were even MORE detailed rules for becoming an ""Immortal"" (read : deity) &amp; interacting with other Immortals &amp; the Multiverse (these originally comprised an entire ""Immortals"" boxed set completing the BECMI series, which was later converted into the ""Wrath Of The Immortals"" boxed set when the other boxes sets were compiled into the hefty ""D&amp;D Cyclopedia."")

I've always wanted to play a 2E or 3.5E character through all the high levels to ""maximum"" level, &amp; then become &amp; play a deity (for a while) --- albeit with some careful, solid homebrew balancing along the way (as reportedly needed at different levels for different characters in the different editions of AD&amp;D.)  Others I know just give up at, say, level 12 in 3.5 &amp; say, ""We can basically do anything we want / we are OP!  Let's not continue &amp; see what epic, large-scale, world-changing things can start to unfold for us &amp; the Cosmos, but start a new campaign at 1st level again!""

They'll hand out the WotC pre gens and do a one shot.  I pulled the trigger on a Warlock concept that I adapted to the pre gen, and I loved her.  But her lust for knowledge, she triggered an attack that just obliterated her.  


However... does she really have to stay dead?  I mean, it was a Pre Gen One Shot and her character concept could very easily adapt to living throughout space and time.  ""Didn't you die?  I saw you die?""  ""Did you now?  I wish someone would have told me!  I'd have filed my taxes differently!""  I mean, who's to say that in another one shot, she doesn't show up again?    


Now, I absolutely believe that if this were an long, ongoing campaign, her death would have more lasting consequences.  Maybe she could come back later, but right away?  naw.  There'd need to be some pretty serious DMing and plot twists... in my opinion.

fpdw9h,CrazyCoolCelt,what can be done to help when bad dice luck and the frightened condition cause a player to just not have a good time?,"I'm talking from a DM perspective, not so much a ""how do I increase my saving throws"" one

last night, we fought a blue dragon while on the road. it used its frightful presence, and our warrior failed every save (even rolling double 7s when our DM decided to give him advantage because this player really loves combat). so the player had no choice but to just stand there and take the dodge action given the scenario (we were on our wagon when the dragon showed up

so since I'm hoping to DM for these guys at some point in the future, how/what might I learn from this scenario? like, what do you do when something like this causes a player to just not get to play the game for reasons out of their control? my first idea would be to have more going on in the fight besides just the dragon (like it could have had some minions with it or something), but I'm curious how anyone has handled this kind of situation. or maybe this was just a fluke and I'm overthinking this

after the session, DM told the player they might let him use CHA instead of WIS for fear effects, but I don't wanna modify the frightened condition or saves if I don't have to. I feel like they have their places in their RAW states",15,1585238085,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpdw9h/what_can_be_done_to_help_when_bad_dice_luck_and/,DnD,3

We're about to have a HUGE battle... like epically huge.  We might die.  Probably will.   So theres an entire cavalry of skull knights... some skeletal archers... and agamemnon.

I am thinking of using polymorph to change the head bad guy into... a mouse. Or something.  Then trapping him in a pocket dimension.


We have these red gems, they're interdimensional pocket dimensions, (hells gems)you need a passphrase to open them, and it's the only way to get in or out.  So, polymorph him into a small creature... throw him into the pocket dimension... deal with the rest of the threats... then either leave the guy in the gem and secure it somewhere... smash it (it's very rare... would rather not)... or beat everything, take a long rest, then try to fight the final bbeg after his minions are destroyed...

fpdhgj,suk_me_hahaha,Ultimate jumping build for D&amp;D 5e,"D&amp;D has rules for jumping, but they're never used for whatever reasons. However if you look into the specifics, modifiers and add-ons,  jumping can get world breaking.  I have found what is, as far as I can tell, the highest possible jump height in fifth edition and a fairly simple character build to achieve and capitalize on it.

The rules for high jumping in 5e are basically that after you run 10 feet you can jump a distance of your strength modifier plus 3 feet to a maximum of however much your remaining speed is (for example, if you have a speed of 20 and a strength of 30, you would have to move 10 feet, and then jump 10 feet instead of 13 feet because you only have 10 feet of movement left).

All you need outside of standard character creation is an uncommon item ""boots of striding and springing"" but even if your Dm doesn't let you get your hands on them, this build can still reach impressive heights, but not quite world shattering.

First, for race, you want to choose grung, because even though grungs have a speed of 25, which is less than optimal, they also have a natural ability called ""standing leap"" allowing them to have a base high jump height of 15 feet. This ability alone is very good and it will be the basis for the rest of the build.

The boots of striding and springing make your speed 30, and triple your jump height to 45. but the boots state that even after they triple your jump height, they don't allow you to exceed your speed in height, meaning your jump height right now is 30

Next, you take 2 levels in monk to get unarmored movement, raising your speed and jump height to 40 Additionally, at this level, you can spend 1 ki point to use ""step of the wind"" doubling your max jump height to 90. Step of the wind, however, does not restrict your jump height to your speed. therefore your current jump height is 80 feet.

Then you take 2 more levels in monk granting you several bonuses.

   You get more ki points meaning more uses of step of the wind

   You get slow fall so if your dm uses fall damage, you can minimize that

   And you get an ability score increase that you want to use to get the feat mobile, adding 10 to your  speed, making your speed 50. Now with a speed above 45, the restriction on the boots of striding and springing is pointless and your jump height is 90.

Now is where you get some freedom with the build. You can either multiclass into artificer, druid, sorcerer, or wizard to get the spell jump, or you can continue in any other class and get the spell jump through the feat magic initiate or the ring of jumping. It doesn't matter which. but with the spell jump, you triple your jump height again to a maximum high jump distance of 270 feet

If there are any mistakes ive made, or anything I've missed, let me know

TLDR: 2 ft frog person jumping 270 feet into the air",10,1585236685,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpdhgj/ultimate_jumping_build_for_dd_5e/,DnD,1

fpd7nr,Dabbadii,"D&amp;D is still the same, predictable game","Hi,

I've played all iterations of D&amp;D. Yes, even the original one back in... Umh, 1986 could be close when I first played the game. Still have the books and even the original boxed set. THAC0 anyone? But some things do not change. Other RPG's? Most of them.

I've conquered worlds, been the most miserable thing you can imagine, been vampire prince etc.

There comes the time when the shit hits the fan. I mean combat. Decades have passed but some mechanics are still there and in the endgame how you win is quite simple:

1: HP. The more the merrier. 5th ed simplifies things quite a lot and I'm quite a fan of advantage/disadvantage mechanics. But in the end, how you tank is HP. Fancy actions help a ton but if you're uncon you are uncon. Period.

2: Do damage. Lots of it. Simple as that.

3: If you minmax, keep \_still\_ something in the bag for that rainy day. Turn that combat around with that. It might be magic item or whatever you choose.

4: RPG the shit out from desperate situation. Do that unfathomable move that no one expects. It might save you. See point one, though. And point three also. This is the exit plan without the actual exit plan.

In 3.5 - for example -  best damage soaker was druid with all the summons and gimmicks. Best offensive tank? Cleric. I remember one time when DM threw literally 100 or so pirates to us and my little gnome druid, riding a dire tiger was just like 'hold my beer' while rest of the party got away. Good luck trying to catch a druid in forest.  While the druid is riding a dire tiger. And the forest ISALIVEDEARGODTREESAREEATINGME. See point 1. We actually did the math for that later for the HP part and it was obvious who won. HPwise. Can't remember the actual numbers, though. But it was clear.

Other incident was also in 3.5, war/strenght cleric with a scythe (Oh those crits, oh boy did those hurt...). See point 2. \_Ridiculous\_ amount of damage. Party consisted vampire monk (that speed really did add up), duergar werebear barbarian (he was able to bring giants down in a turn, easily), rakshasa bard (oh boy, he could talk but wouldn't shut up), some strange evil lovecraftian druid, permanently invisible kobold sorcerer (basically a weapon of mass destruction. Drones, exponential), drow rogue that could take a dump in Jarlaxles morning cereal and get away with it and so on.

We tracked damage and in the end, cleric was on top. See point 2. This was when party could bring hurt for 500-1000 per round. Can't remember the exact numbers but a lot. You'll get the idea.

So, my point? See 1-4.

D&amp;D hasn't changed much. Same things still apply. Has D&amp;D evolved? Yes, it has. Ruleset defines quite much, obviously. If you keep to basics you have a winning chance.

I want them to get something when they join that will help them identify with the group. They are pretty low-level (Lvl 3), but it's a pretty fast-growing campaign. They'll gain about 1 level every two sessions, depending on how focused they are on reaching the milestones. So balancing is an issue, but I'm not that worried (if they all get the same level of things I can balance it out by making encounters more difficult. 

Not sure what would be best though, but I have a few ideas: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. A magical signet ring that allows you two increase an ability score by two points while wearing it
2. Custom-made +1 armor for each class that bears the sigil of the organization
3. Partaking in a ritual / a magical item that grants them the ""Radiant Soul"" feature from Aasimars (basically flight for a short time + a bit of extra radiant damage) 
4. A magical item that allows them to gain the effects of a long rest in a short rest, once per day (they can still do a normal long rest in those 24h) 

The theme of the organization is 'defenders of the realm against all forms of evil', and they are pretty resourceful. So I think pretty much anything that would be helpful in that direction could make sense for them to have.

Im also a big advocate of DMs describing monsters as the PCs would see them vs just telling the players the name of the monster they're fighting.


My players awoke as their leomunds tiny hut dissapated. They were barely awake when the sound struck their ears: a high pitched scream. The house was right nearby. Two stayed behind as the others ahead as the others quickly packed camp. Upon arriving at the front of the house they found the door warped inward, though no scratches or marks against it. Inside was a woman crying over the death of her young brother. 

After consoling her and making sure see was safe, they were able to learn that she found him there just a moment ago. And that he was alive 15 minutes before. They also learned that there were 9 other murders/odd deaths in the town within the last 10 days. They set off to look for information. Finding an inn with an underground speakeasy, they went to check out both. The innkeeper told them that there weren't any murders, that some townsfolk were just being dramatic. This world sees sadness and death all of the time, and theres no reason to think that these deaths were unusual. 

The barkeep in the speakeasy thought different. He also ran a jobs board. There was a job to specifically kill the inkeeper. It was really old. The barkeep told em he let any job be posted. Even one in the past ghat was to destroy his establishment, previously withdrawn. A small tussle insued between the players due to some alcoholic consumption, but after another scream could be heard from back upstairs. They returned to see her being lifted off the ground by something they couldn't see, her mouth forced open, and the room was blowing with a decent wind. 

They used magic to reveal the invisible creature, kind off. Nothing but a humanoid like silhouette was seen. They rolled for initiative, and it was pretty sad on their side. After a few rounds, the invisible being retreated without being able to kill its quarry thanks to the inkeeper being brought back to life twice with revivify and taking enough damage that it decided to retreat to preserve its life. Though they're almost certain it'll be back. They were able to gather a lot of clues as to why the people that were killed were targeted, though they're still looking for more information. 

I asked if any of them knew what it was out of game after the session. No clues. No one was even willing to shoot a guess because they were so uncertain.

She mentions having gotten her powers from a magical sentient ring which had asked her for help and being a good natured person, her character agreed. Less of a pact, more of a mutually beneficial relationship where the ring says : Hey please help me, I can give you these cool powers to do so and my player agrees.

Now, she's given me free reign as to the motivations of this ring and what it actually wants and honestly I'm not too fond of the idea of it just being good natured or in distress.

I think this ring is malicient in some way and just found that it has more fun convincing goody two shoes like my player then outright possessing them and influencing their actions.

My current train of thought though is, what can this magical ring's purpose be? Why does it grant abilities to its wearer ? What does it ask its wearer to do and what exactly does it want?

If you have cool ideas, id really like to steal them.

Our players had really great rolls and the players don‚Äôt know it, but the table I used just so happened to have their pursuers caught by a hungry Umber Hulk! After some smart choices as well, the Pursuit level is down to 1.


They have been particularly cautious, hiding their trail with Eldeth‚Äôs help (RIP she was killed by a wraith, but that happened later). Here is the problem I ran into, I wanted to have those random sort of encounters and wouldn‚Äôt you know it, with the players rolling for encounters, they nearly made it to the Dark Lake without a single major event...


We have run Lost Tomb now, (very tragic scene where Eldeth leapt in front of the Wraith‚Äôs last attack to save her Uncle the Wizard, before being cut down.) I had a party member roll to see what the NPCs encountered while they were exploring and it just so happened to be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù Deep Gnome Traders, which is perfect because the party just made bank in all the fancy pieces they found tomb raiding. So, they will finally have a chance to provision themselves some what (after nearly starving).


Moving forward I thought of doing more of a mix of pre-planned encounters, terrain and/or creatures, with some random ones thrown in so the party still gets to roll occasionally.

Of the ones that I listened to the ones that really got me going were Shadow Over Innsmouth, and At the Mountains of Madness.

Shadow Over Innsmouth is just a great plot to use for a DnD adventure in general. You almost don't need to change any of it because it's already so perfect. This idea is so ingrained in culture that listening to it I was like ""Wow that's where all these quests in video games and movie plots came from."" It's absolutely classic, and the twist of it being an party of adventurers rather than a lone dude would change the dynamic in a good way.

At the Mountains of Madness would be way different in a DnD game because the actual plot of the story wouldn't be very fun to play through. With that being said the concept of what Dr Dyer and his expedition experienced could easily turn into a super crazy and existentially creepy adventure for a dnd party.

Are there any other Lovecraft stories that would make great DnD adventures? Ideally trying to stick to recommending without spoilers as I'm not super familiar with Lovecraft's work.",9,1585231344,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpbztb/ripping_lovecraft_stories_for_dnd_adventure_plots/,DnD,1

fpbm9m,NICWARREN13,I need help creating my character," 

Hey Awesome people on Reddit, so I need help with my new character for an upcoming game with some friends. I had talked to my GM about using Matt Mercer‚Äôs Edgy son- The Blood Hunter and she said yes!.  I want to go with a character that has a *Supernatural-esque* feel, and try to make this edgy boy a whole lot duller (Less Edgy). I have a basic backstory set up for the character, but I really need help flushing it out, and picking both a race and subclass to get that proper *Supernatural* feel. This is where I turn to you Redditors for some advice and opinions for setting up this character because I am straight stumped. P.S: We all are big roleplay nerds in our group so details are going to be pretty important. 

Basic Things I Know about this character.

Backstory

1. He was married
2. His husband was a blood hunter who kept it a secret from him
3. His husband went on a hunting trip and never came back
4. He did not learn from the blood hunter order, instead, he learned from his husband‚Äôs book that he found in the attic.
5. He trained himself and his goal through the campaign will be to find his husband.

I am having trouble coming up with who is his husband and what happened to him.

Basic Character Traits.

Chaotic Good: willing to do morally questionable things to do what he believes is right, and help others.

kind, sympathetic, and caring.

I just was curious about any ideas for the blood hunter subclass that will give that *Supernatural* feel, the race for the character, and any more ideas for both fleshing out his backstory and character traits.",5,1585229840,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fpbm9m/i_need_help_creating_my_character/,DnD,1
fpbj6w,KingFerdidad,What do you do when failure is so much more interesting than success?,"Couple weeks back my party and I were sailing the high seas, a day away from our destination, when a gang of sahaugin emerged from the surf on chariots pulled by sharks. T'was a metal sight.

We had an awesome fight. The fight was split on the port and starboard sides. My fighter was leaping from chariot to chariot, chopping heads off on the starboard side, whilst the ranger picked them off. Meanwhile the magic users were having more trouble. On the port side the sahuagin coral smashers breached the ship and clambered into the hole. They were going to scuttle the ship.

There at the table, as the party was fretting over how to fight them, I cheered. Everyone looked confused.

Sorcerer: Why are you so happy?""

Me: They're gonna breach the hold!

Rouge: Yeah, that's bad. We have to stop them.

Me: But the ship's gonna sink and we'll be shipwrecked. Isn't that so cool?

So from them on I was of two minds. When I played my fighter I was cursing the sahaugin and doing everything I could to stop them, but when it was the DM's turn I would cheer the sahuagin and boo the crew members who tried to stop them.

We beat the sahaugin, but not soon enough to stop the ship was sinking. Yes, it was cool. We had to hijack the sahuagin's chariots and charm the sahuagin into rescuing the drowning crew members. Our next adventure was about getting off the island was a real hit.

fpb3dn,sleepystarchild,Your experiences with DMing for or playing with strangers?,"TL;DR: Exactly as the title says. If I were to DM for a group of strangers, what should I expect? Any unique challenges to the situation? What have some of your experiences been like either DMing for or playing with strangers?

A few days ago I posted in this subreddit about having a problem DM and what to do about it... my group and I decided to give him one more chance to be polite, since he's a... friend, I guess, after it became apparent through talking to him that he was not going to change some of his his behavior, listen to comments and concerns, or even follow rules--whether they be official or homebrew--consistently. The plan was to then switch over to letting me DM. 

After last night's disastrous game, though, no one in the party wants to play anymore... at all. They are all completely turned off to the idea of playing DnD at the moment because our DM was so rude, controlling, inconsistent, and difficult. I have no one else I know in real life who is willing to play with me, and right now with how everything is, the thought of DMing was the glue that was holding me together. 

So I'm tentatively considering putting out the ol' feelers on the internet, looking for a party that I can DM for. But I'm such a terribly new DM (I DM'ed a few sessions a year ago but my group fell apart due to scheduling conflicts... since then I have ravenously consumed Matt Colville and Crit Role content, etc., to grow as a DM after I realized how much I enjoyed it, just haven't been able to put it into practice) that I don't know if attempting to organize an online game with strangers is a terrible idea or not.

So I'm wondering what your experiences are on the subject. Anything I need to look out for? Is it just a bad idea right now due to my experience level, plain and simple? Do you have horror stories, or success stories, about playing with or DMing for total strangers? What do I need to know?

&gt;\- An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

Now, initially I assumed this was just to reiterate the rules of attacking or being attacked by a creature you cannot see.

However - RAW - if you gain the ability to see an invisible creature (say by having Truesight), the creature still has the invisible condition on it. Which means that, even if you can see it, the invisible creature still has advantage an attack rolls and you still have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.

In either case, very rarely does the player include lore and history of their equipment. This simple and minute detail is a huge lost opportunity, not only for the player, but for the DM as well. Today we cover [""100 Weapon Histories""](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/236970/100-Weapon-Histories?affiliate_id=1546158) by [DnDSpeak](http://dndspeak.com/)¬† a list of 100 interesting weapon stories is great for adding fantastic stories to mundane or magical weapons. A player can take their roleplay to the next level but using these histories in their characters background, or adventuring career. These also make for a great DM plot hook. A weapon used to murder a queen? I bet it's famous enough to be recognized by servants of the slain queen.

fp9vqv,that_jackp,Can you guys help balance my encounter,"I'm running a one-shot with the following encounters and I need to know if it will be balanced:

Start by fighting: 1 berserker and 2 thugs

Next fight: 4 bugbears

Then: 1 young white dragon

The party is of 3lvl 5s and according to kobold fight club that is below the daily budget (well I just used the ""hard"" XP amount and doubled it as that seemed more feasible. With only taking maybe one or two short rests will the players be able to manage this.

A 2nd level conjuration wizard can use the minor conjuration feature together with the prestidigitation cantrip to become the best chef ever. All you need to do is create a simple food item with the minor conjuration feature (although it goes away if you do damage to the object so maybe something to lick like a sucker or the fantasy equivalent) and then use the prestidigitation to flavor it to taste like anything. Just set up a stand and have everyone line up to get the treats of every flavor and make sure whoever gets one eats it quick cause you can only make one at a time. Also a great prank to give someone. Just watching people get great treats and end up getting one that tastes like dog crap,5,1585219463,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp9ez5/conjuration_cook_im_sure_someones_already_thought/,DnD,1
fp9bhx,George_jpg,Why is trickster cleric so useless? [5e],"Before character creation, i thought it would be a fun idea to make a character that relies on deception and clones and misdirection to accomplish their goals. So I looked up ways I can do that and found out about trickster Cleric. The discussion online regarding this subclass is that it is useless, annoying and straight up garbage. I thought, oh what do they know?, and  proceeded to make a follower of Loki.

Fast forward a few sessions after we started the game, turns out, trickster clerics are absolute GARBAGE. My character does not deal damage, does not have many opportunities to make creative problem solving during fights and has a ridiculous amount of hit points which makes combat an absolute drag. 

I had to opt out to multi-classing as a rogue to even make the build be more mobile, so i don't get one shotted every fight. 

Every creative ability he has, costs way too much time (invoke duplicity is an action and you get it once a long rest, mirror image is an action, charm person does not usually work with a 13 spellcasting DC) 

It really bummed me out that i couldn't make a creative and fun build work and instead i had to opt out for a more generic character.

I mean, what kind of trickster doesn't get minor illusion on its spell list.

And he was also one of my players...

My group is new to D&amp;D, and I don't want them to feel wrong playing the campaign without him. 
It feels wrong writing his character out of the story, and it feels wrong just leaving him on the side of the road. 

I'm having a meeting with the party later today, but I have no idea what to do, or what to say... We were all very close, and the accident has hit us hard...

I rewarded my rogues roleplaying with a magic bow that basically casts a modified version of catapult... It's weaker on average than her attacks before she had it, but she doesn't realize that and she loves it.

I just gave my fighter magic plate armor (just has the demon armor 1d8 magical piercing dmg)... But only because:
1. An NPC promised he'd reward the players
2. He has been a better player than the rogue (as in more respectful and trying to let everyone have fun) and I wanted him to feel rewarded
3. He was going to fight an enemy with plate armor in the next session
4. They fought something with immunity to nonmagical damage and he felt useless
5. The same NPC cursed it similarly to demon armor so that he'd have difficulty attacking said NPC in the future

The other magic items I've given them are bracers of archery that nobody uses, a bag of holding, and an immovable rod (I was hoping they'd show me some creative uses but so far have only used it to lock a drunk PC in a room. He got out.)

I was thinking that occasionally some random NPC gets possessed into attacking my player and he has to always be wary of when this could strike.

That being said, his beliefs about the way certain animals are treated and the balance of living creatures is very strict. This belief system is the ""law"" so to speak. Is a personal/familial law that will not be deviated from enough to be LG?

fp7nux,aman08888,[OC] Please Help!! I can't decide which Pact to take after DS Sorcerer 5/ Hexblade 2,"Hi All!

I have played a lot of different classes in 3.5 and am playing in a 5e campaign for the first time and I'm having trouble deciding what Pact I want to have my character take.

I am playing a Divine Soul Sorcerer, currently at Lvl 4 Sheet attached, and I am playing in a 3 person party, with a Cleric/ Fighter (fairly experienced player in 3.5 like me) and an Arcane Trickster Rogue (A brand new player in their 1st campaign), and I foresee myself getting into melee a good amount. I am fine with this because I was planning on going Hexblade 5 anyway, for the medium armor, invocations and other shenanigry, and have already come in contact with a potential patron in game, but with all this quaranfree time I have had a LOT of free time to plan this character more. As a result, I have been looking into the pacts more, which invocations pair well with their abilities and etc., and the more I look into them the tougher it gets to decide which one I want to go with because I can see the benefits of each for both my character and the party, both in and out of combat.

I plan on, after 5 lvls of both DS Sorcerer and Hexblade Warlock, going 10 lvls in Lore Bard, for more shenanegry and becoming a Master of the Elements. The way I have this build planned I will be a Jack of All Trades kind of a role for the party and kind of a fun idea I came up with that I wanted to try. I will have 14 Cantrips (One of every Damaging Energy type, hence master of the elements), \~32 Spells Known (Across 4 Spell lists, Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer and Warlock), Max Bard Spell lvl known: 5th, 2 spells that come back on short rests that can be up to lvl 3, Simple and Martial Weapon Proficiencies, Medium Armor Proficiency, 3 Invocations, 5d10 Bardic Inspiration Die, Cutting Words, and 2 Metamagics: Quicken and Subtle.

I am mainly just torn on which Pact to pick because which ever one I go with affects how my character both views and handles situations both in and out of combat, which has a big effect on how I role play him.

I like to plan my characters at least a few, 4-5, levels in advance, normally but with all this free time I kinda did a swan dive down the planning rabbit hole and got all the way to lvl 20 XD, so I can have an idea of how to role play my guy to know how he'd handle certain situations/ opportunities if they arose that could help him attain his goals. I also like to let my DM know how I plan on having my characters go, that way they know how I am planning my character to go and if they felt like it they could make plot points/ sidequests/ NPCs, whatever to make the transitions seem more organic and not just, ""Hey this seemed like a fun class combo"".

Any and all help and input is greatly appreciated and welcome!

p.s.- If I go Pact of the Blade, at lvl 4, I am torn between taking an ASI, Maxing out my Charisma at Character Lvl 9, and taking a feat, either lucky or great weapon master since my weapon of choice would be either a Glaive, Great Sword or Maul (Depending on which weapon type I wanted/ needed to deal). Any thoughts on this are gladly welcome too!

p.p.s.- I have plenty of time to decide on this. We are playing with milestone XP, and are, hopefully, going to be hitting lvl 5 soon. 

TL;DR- Currently DS Sorc lvl 4, in a 3 person party with a cleric/figher and a rogue.

fp76y5,Mindless-Presence,Are my players flirting too much ?,"Hey, this is a question for all the DMs...
Since a few weeks, I have a new D&amp;D party: a wizard, a barbarian, a paladin and a druid.
Its been pretty fun playing with this group, except one thing: They flirt. Way too much.
I mean at first it was entertaining, but I feel like it‚Äôs getting out of hand.
Since Session one the wizard has been flirting and trying to seduce practically everything. When the barbarian joined in, it has already gotten like a cringe running gag, when they rolled a natural 20 on charisma they always said ‚ÄûHow you doing ?‚Äú (uk like Joe from friends).
But then they started to miss important clues and information.
The most frustrating moment so far: We were on a ship to the other side of the continent. I planned some kind of Murdermystery on said boat, which would lead into revealing the identity of the villain of this campaign. I present you the most weirdest conversation of my entire life:
Me: after ur first night on the ship, you awake at sunrise. As you and your team gets up, the captain enters your room. What...
Barbarian: I seduce the captain!!!!
Me: Roll ...
Barbarian: Natural 20
Later:
Me: As you enter the room of the captain, you smell something rotten. This horrible smell seems to come from a big golden chest in a corner. You know the smell from your past. It‚Äôs the smell of blood.
Barbarian: Wait... How long is it going to take till we arrive at our destination?
Me: 9 days...
Barbarian: I fuck the captain for nine days!!!

I didn‚Äôt even bother asking for a dive roll, it seemed pointless. Our wizard did basically the same as the barbarian and the Druid and paladin wanted to show the crew of the ship that not all adventurers are lust-driven animals. So they played chess for 9 days.

It‚Äôs really stressing me out that my players keep missing my clues. I mean I‚Äôm used to not using 80% of my material, but I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know what to do...
Is it my fault that my players don‚Äôt get the clues ? They don‚Äôt even notice my eternal struggle, after each session they tell me it‚Äôs been even better than last time.
So to all the DMs out there: Do you had/have the same problem?
Should I just relaxe and try to enjoy the campaign more? Please share any solutions you may have with me. I would appreciate it so much.
Sorry for any Grammar mistakes  and thanks for your help.",21,1585207031,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp76y5/are_my_players_flirting_too_much/,DnD,1

fp6k60,Welcome_to_the_night,Is my characters story good,"Once there was a powerful necromancer, whom threatened the very world. He planned on fusing his mortal instrument with the vast tapestry that was time. He was so very close to becoming the most powerful being in all of everything, but, alas, five brave hero's stepped up, and slew him in his own abode.

Years later, a child was born in a small village, with the same mark on his chest, the very same mark that the necromancer had. The mark was a sign of evil, a reincarnation, lasting for thousands of years.

But disgrace had no interest in carnage or sadism, instead the little one wanted friendship; someone he could tell of his hopes and dreams. Instead he was tossed aside, his own mother abandoned him the moment the mark appeared, his name stripped away from him, replaced with disgrace, other children were instructed by there parents to avoid him at all costs, the orphanage wouldn't take him in; he was forced to live in an abandoned farm house, forced to suffer isolation.

But disgrace carried on, to follow his dreams of becoming a jester, that would dance, and spread merriment to all. He practiced how to read and write all on his own, practiced jokes and how to dance properly, until an opportunity arose.

A local noble was holding a grand festival, to celebrate the the trees coming back from there temporary slumber, a yearly tradition. But there was different variable, something that could drag him out of the depths of misery and into the warm embrace of happiness, the nobles jester had died, and was holding a contest to find his replacement.

He practiced ten times as hard, to make sure his routine was absolutely amazing, something to wow the local nobility. But the villagers caught wind of it, and believed  he was attempting to insert himself in a position of power. They came up with a plan to utterly ruin his chances of ever becoming something more dangerous, he practiced alone, In an abandoned farm house he called home. They caught wind of his main act, he was practicing a very difficult song, known as ""sorrow in the hills"".

The night of the festival was upon them, the tents were set up (after a multitude of failed attempts), the feast prepared, with some of the most exotic meats one could imagine, and the jesters were lining up to sign there names, for a chance to become a professional fool. Disgrace was wracked with nervousness, he knew this was his one shot at a good life. He reached for his back to check his lute; which he bought after slaving away for the local businesses, perfectly fine, he had gone through hell to preserve it, and it would all pay off today.

Disgrace was practically galloping up the stage, eager for a chance to prove himself. He opened the case, his hands felt clammy, this didn't feel real, he brushed those thoughts aside and gently placed the lute on his lap, and began strumming, but, unfortunately, all of his excitement was for nought, and the strings snapped almost instantly, disgrace broke into tears on stage, much to the delight of the villagers, it was simple, while he left to work for the stores, someone snuck in and filed down the strings, until they were practically useless.

After several seconds of disgrace crying on stage the noble told the guards to remove him from the stage, he didn't resist. The festival was all the sweeter, hell they probably didn't even have to sabotage him, there were entertainers there whom had been formally trained, still better to not leave that up to chance.

The next dawn, disgrace was sitting in the center of the town, on the well. No matter how many rocks they threw at him, or how much they shouted, he wouldn't even react, much less budge. He sat there for two days straight, some people thought he died, but after they realised he wouldn't budge they just ignored him.

The next day they all disappeared without a trace.",8,1585203647,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp6k60/is_my_characters_story_good/,DnD,1

fp6cps,jcp1195,Need a good Great Old One for Background purposes.,"A bit of background:

My group of friends is about to begin Hoard of the Dragon Queen (I got our forever DM the special edition Tyranny of Dragons book for Christmas) and our DM, Mitch for ease, has his own little Multiverse that spans every game he runs including books, meaning our past characters often drop in here and there without warning. Because of this Mitch has basically trained us to care immensely for every character we make even in one-offs and book campaigns. 

That said, I‚Äôm making a Great Old One Warlock born a Human but painfully and forcefully transformed into a Changeling by an angry Great Old One getting payback for one of his ancestors having slighted them in the past. The Great Old One grants them visions from time to time, using them to give them tasks for its own benefit. I rolled for the campaign bond and got the following:

 ‚ÄúEvery five nights, you have a strange sequence of apocalyptic dreams. The world is destroyed by Cold, choking fumes, lightning storms, waves of acid, and horrible fire. Each time, the dream ends with ten evil eyes glaring at you from the darkness. You feel a strange compulsion to travel to Greenest. Perhaps the answer to the riddle of your dreams awaits you there.‚Äù 

So it fits almost perfectly with what I was already thinking of for this character. It‚Äôs entirely possible Mitch may toss in some stuff about his background or Patron during this campaign or Rise of Tiamt, so I need help picking an Old One.

They‚Äôre one of the few types of Creatures/Deities I‚Äôm less familiar with and the only one I know very well is Karsus but I‚Äôm not sure if he fits the role. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Will be playing Tyranny of Dragons as a Great Old One Warlock, need ideas for an angry, malevolent Old One to serve as his Patron.",9,1585202524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp6cps/need_a_good_great_old_one_for_background_purposes/,DnD,1

His twin can only be described as a stereotypical cowboy, except racist toward non-humans and on a quest for vengeance.

fp5jgc,SkyeTheKnumpty,"What are some interesting ""bad endings"" to official 5e campaigns?","I've been considering running a homebrew campaign that involves the heroes being sent to various points in time and space by Istus/Savras to ""fix"" the aftermath of a villain/extraplanar entities time shenanigans. It would involve them heading to the """"bad ending"" aftermath of official WotC campaigns (and altered versions of key moments in Toril's history) and finding out what happened and how to go back and fix it.

Some examples I have of this are:

* The Tyranny of Dragons cult being tipped off early that the (campaigns) party are going to prevent the rise of Tiamat, leading the cult to kill off the party early, allowing Tiamat to rise unopposed.
* The Storm King's Thunder party being told by a mysterious figure that they'd be needed in Nightstone. They head there earlier than they should and rocks fall party dies. Giants take over/wreck shop with a civil war? (I never finished Storm Kings)
* Nothing changes in Curse of Strahd because Barovia is *in* its worst timeline during the campaign.
* The Tomb of Annihilation &gt;!atropal becomes a god of death, ravages the prime material and leaves it in a post-apocalyptic state free for Acerak to do with as he pleases.!&lt;

Unfortunately, I haven't really got through many of the other official Campaigns, so I was wondering if there are any interesting possibilities for post 'worst timeline' settings?

fp5g60,Nicholas_TW,Have you ever made a player cry via storytelling? I'll start.," The first time I made a player cry, it was when her character's dog got killed in combat.

The second time I made a player cry, it was when her character's mentor figure was killed and had prepared a letter for her in the event of his death, explaining that he had no intention of being resurrected and that he always saw her as a daughter to replace the daughter he once had who was killed.

The third time I made a player cry, the party's village had been razed by the BBEG, leaving the party on a multi-year quest for vengeance. Then, the session before they finally encountered him, they were trapped in an illusory ""other world"" alongside the souls of their loved ones which had died in the village. They spent a whole session as their level 1 selves, with their original level 1 character sheets, preparing for the paladin's little sister's birthday party... Then they slowly regained their memories of the real world and had to turn their backs on their old lives and families and move forward to the future. I was playing ""Don't Think Twice"" from Kingdom Hearts as the fake, 'perfect' world which could have been crumbled around them and the paladin hugged his crying sister as she vanished into his arms.

fp4bjn,Bulbous_Boysenberry,My Idea For The Best Complex Trap Ever.,"I hope this really is okay, and i don't come off as a delusioned egotistical weirdo who has no DM skills.

  


**Mephistopheles‚Äô Grand Trap:**

A dungeon built into the side of the mountain.

**Complex Trap:**

The trap consists of a long stone hallway that is 20ft wide, 20ft tall, and 140ft long, with a treasure chest at the end, and a secret door beyond that, leading to a room filled with treasure. At first, it appears completely normal stone hallway, but traps trigger as the characters work their way through. This is a test from the Archdevil Mephistopheles to the characters to test a magic ring that binds the mind of a single Archdevil to one character. The goal is to see the limits of the ring's power and to test the trap/characters to evaluate his skills in arcane trap-building and magic item-crafting.

**Character Level:** This trap is intended for 3 characters of 4th level, but could be literally any number of characters (it doesn‚Äôt get much easier with more) and/or be up to 8th level. I HIGHLY recommend using an NPC as one of the players, because you can manipulate it to have the funniest outcome. For example, at the secret door, if one of the characters is brash, and they are about to just stick their hand in, which would make it not funny at all, an NPC could yell, ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù, and then stick a non-magical object in, singeing it and causing the intrigue to rise dramatically.

**XP:** 62,000 per character.

**Trigger:** as soon as a creature that is not a fiend without the Amulet of Mephistopheles enters the dungeon.

**Initiative:** Trap acts on initiative count 20, as well as instantaneously.

**Conditions:** No speed other than walking works here, and a magical slowing effect means that a creature may not take the Dash action on their turn, may only make a max of one attack per turn, and may not take reactions.

**Active Elements:** Immediate: wall of force appears behind them. Tiled floor with poison darts in first 40ft, archway of enlarge/reduce in the next 5ft, blades that slice upwards from ground and ceiling in the next 25ft, a floor that disappears into a pit with small spikes and animated skeletons in the next 40ft, vines that drag you back through the rest in the next 10ft, a treasure chest that spews undetectable psychic gas illusioned to look like a regular chest with treasure in room beyond, a door with magical darkness over the lever, elemental gems where, when you choose one (or two, if the characters are smart),  the rest are unleashed upon them.  

**Wall of Force (No initiative):** An invisible wall of force appears immediately after the characters enter, blocking their escape. Whenever any living thing tries to pass through it, they make a 20 Dex save, getting moved 5ft back and knocked prone on a fail.

**Watch Your Step (Initiative 20):** The floor slides apart in two halves, revealing a tiled floor below that is 40ft long. In order to step on the right tiles, characters must step on the tiles in a random pattern, which takes a successful 20 Wisdom check for each individual step, making the Dex save on a fail, and a 15 Acrobatics check to leap onto the tile, also making the Dex ave on a fail. There is a pattern to the tiles, which turns out to be an Infernal rune for Mephistopheles. Characters who know Infernal realize this on a successful 15 Insight or Perception check, and they do not have to make the Wisdom check, but still make the Acrobatics check.

**Effects:** Characters who step on the wrong tiles hear a ‚Äòchonk‚Äô noise and must make a 20 Dex save or get a dart in the neck, taking 1d4 piercing damage and 1d10 poison damage. In addition, they must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 hour.

**Archway of Enlarge/Reduce (No initiative):** As the characters pass through the archway into the next section, they may have their size randomly changed, which affects future traps (see table).

D6         Effect

1            Their size is now Huge

2            Their size is now Large

3-4         Nothing changes

5            Their size is now Small

6            Their size is now Tiny

**Slicing Doom (Initiative 20):** For 25ft, blades spring out of the floor and ceiling. These are illusioned to look like a normal floor or ceiling, when in reality, they have slits in them that let blades spring forth. A character that goes barefoot can feel these on the floor, and with a DC 10 Perception or Insight check, they realize that there is something fishy afoot. Otherwise, it takes a DC 25 Perception check to realize there is a trap. As soon as all members of the party go within the area, this part of the trap is triggered. If the characters step through one at a time or in any amounts less then the total, they avoid triggering the trap. 

**Effects:** On initiative count 20, if all the characters are within range, each character of size Small and larger must dodge the blades with a 20 Dex save, taking 5d10 slashing damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. Creatures Large or bigger make the save with disadvantage, and Small creatures don‚Äôt take any damage on a success.

**Skeleton Pit Trap (No initiative; Immediate):** A large 40ft pit with a disappearing floor that vanishes once the characters reach a certain point. There is a magical sensor built into the ceiling at the halfway point, and as soon as it senses any humanoid not wearing an Amulet of Mephistopheles within 5ft of it, the trap is triggered. The trap can be sensed by any divination magic, but anything placed on the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù seems to sit there as normal. It takes a DC 25 Perception check for any character to realize that there is a sort of pit trap there, but they do not determine the type.

**Effects:** The floor disappears, and all of the characters within the area of the trap fall 30ft into the spiked pit of skeletons, taking 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed 15 Dex save, and half as much on a success. Characters within 5 feet of the edge don‚Äôt fall if they succeed another 20 Dex save, and take the original save on a fail (15 Dex) to determine damage. Once the characters fall to the bottom, they must roll yet another 20 Dex save to avoid small spikes coated in an adhesive. On a fail, they take 1d6 piercing damage, and they are **restrained,** except they make attack rolls without disadvantage. At the beginning of each of their turns, they make a DC 20 Strength check, breaking free on a success. As soon as the characters raise themselves, **20 skeletons** rise from the bones and attack the characters. If/when the characters survive, the characters must make a DC 15 Athletics check and then a DC 10 Constitution check (in that order) to climb out of the pit. If they fail the Constitution check, they fall again from a height of 20ft, but the max damage is now only 2d6, and they have to make the same saves and everything, but no skeletons attack the players once they right themselves. 

**Grasping Vines (Initiative 20):** Entangling vines erupt from a 10 ft section of the floor near the beginning of the room as soon as any humanoid without the Amulet of Mephistopheles enters a 10ft area at the end of the room. 

**Effects:** Each creature within the area at the end of the room must make a 15 Dex save or get restrained by the vines at the beginning of each of the vines‚Äô turns. As soon as any characters are restrained, the floor appears again on top of the **Skeleton Pit** (see above) and spikes grow at a 45 degree angle from the floor. These spikes deal 1d8 piercing damage on a hit, but they make attack rolls against the players with a +5 modifier. On each turn after any creatures are restrained, the vines move 20ft towards the door, reactivating traps along the way. As an action, a restrained creature can make a DC 20 Strength check to break free of the vines, ripping through them on a success. When the characters pass through the **Grasping Vines** the second time, the vines do not appear again. In addition, if attacked, a section of vine has AC 13 and 10 HP each, is immune to poison, psychic, psychic, and thunder damage, has a resistance to bludgeoning and force damage, and is vulnerable to cold and fire damage. The character(s) attacking it must target a section that does not have another character in its grasp. If a vine is cut, all of the vine above the slice disappears, any creature restrained by the vine is freed, and the vine is not able to restrain any creatures for 24 hours if it still is there by the end of that period (once all creatures leave the area, the vines disappear).

**False Treasure Chest:** The treasure chest at the end of the hall is a fake that spews undetectable psychic gas, but with an illusion cast on it and the wall behind it to disguise the **Secret Door** set into it (see below). As soon as the lid is opened, illusory treasure appears, when it is in reality spewing a silent death from its maw.

**Wall of force:**

**Illusion:** It creates the illusion of piles of gold coins, whatever treasure they desire most, and jewels beyond their wildest dreams. When they first open it, each character makes a DC 15 Insight check to see through the illusion. They make this check on each of their turns. Also, If a character tries to use an item, it is revealed that it is an illusion. A character who uses part of their turn to tell the others about the illusion gives them the benefits as well. Once the illusion dissipates, the characters can see the secret door in all its glory (see below), the true nature of the chest is revealed, and the psychic gas stops wajoingling outwards from the pipe, and no longer causes any damage.

**Psychic Gas:** For each turn the illusion persists, the characters must make a DC 15 Constitution save, taking 1d8 psychic damage on a failed save. 

**Secret Door:** There is a secret door behind the treasure that has a lever set into the wall. The alcove with the lever has magical darkness filling it, which leads the characters to believe that there will be a trap, when really all they have to do is put their hand in the alcove and pull the lever. To add to the suspense, the alcove singes any non-magical inanimate objects that enter it. The door is made of solid stone, and is easily noticed. There is an inscription on the door, which reads in infernal: *Tread carefully, for we are all amongst the horrors of oneself. What is done is never undone.*

**Lever:** The alcove is filled with magical darkness, which fools any investigation,  perception, or insight checks, and confuses detect magic and similar spells. In addition, this darkness cannot be dispelled, or affected in any way. If the characters stick any weapon or non-magical inanimate object, it comes out illusioned to look like it is singed or damaged in some way (DM‚Äôs choice). All a character needs to do is reach their hand in and pull the lever, and the door will open as normal. Then they will be able to proceed.

**Treasure Room:** The treasure room is a room with piles of gold and magic items, and has a large pillar with four fist-sized revolving gems suspended above it; one ruby, one diamond, one emerald, and one sapphire.

**Contents:** 49,134 gp, 39,475 pp, vorpal greatsword, staff of the magi, +2 plate, belt of storm giant strength, +3 splint, robe of the Archmagi, 4 elemental gems (characters can only get one), fine gold chain with fire opal, old masterpiece painting, silk and velvet mantle with moonstones, platinum bracelet set with jewel chips, embroidered glove set with jewel chips, jeweled anklet, gold circlet set with four aquamarines, eye patch with a mock eye set in blue sapphire and moonstone, and a necklace strung with small pink pearls.

**Trap (Immediate):** After any creature touches or grabs one or more of the elemental gems (if they touch more than one, they must be touched simultaneously), they all explode, dealing no damage, which unleashes their effects immediately. *However.* Only the elementals from the stones that are being held by the creature are under their control, and all other elementals are hostile towards them and have a chaotic evil alignment.",9,1585192997,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp4bjn/my_idea_for_the_best_complex_trap_ever/,DnD,1

fp47ac,michaelmhughes,Simple Day Tracking Tool,"&amp;#x200B;

I put this together for myself and thought others might find it useful. 

[RPG Day Tracker](https://preview.redd.it/4xlt7d2yoxo41.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb46aba267568a68e0aaa8ef972c3d7198f24891)

Printable PDF can be found here:

[http://www.filedropper.com/rpgdaytracker](http://www.filedropper.com/rpgdaytracker)

I am often pretty loosey-goosey when it comes to tracking time in my campaign. My players often ask, ""What time of day is it?"" and I have to mentally backtrack (Hmm, they just wiped out those goblins, but before that they had breakfast and the Cleric spent time praying....). I have been trying to figure out a way to loosely track time during any given game day, but only now found something that works without being too complex or just a general pain in the ass.

Here's how I use it.

I print out one copy of the PDF and put it on the table where both I and my players can see it. I use a small, colorful stone or crystal as a token, but you can use a coin, a mini, whatever. When the day starts, I place my token in the far left section of the upper quadrant (with the rising sun). That section represents sunrise, and most PCs (even if the players are slugs) tend to be rise-and-shine-and-adventure types.

As the morning progresses, I slide the token to the right one section for each ""chunk"" of action (which I think of in roughly hour/1.5 hour increments). I don't have hard and fast rules or this.

\---

**Fo example:** Let's say the PCs are outdoors. They wake up and cook a hearty breakfast (move one space), pack up camp (one space), and hit the road to the city of Vallaki. They spend 2 hours traveling (move two spaces) and now they move into the daytime quadrant.

I move the token into the first daytime quadrant as they continue travel and‚Äîoh no!‚Äîare attacked by a pack of dire wolves. I tend to treat most combats as one section, because even if it's a short battle, there's always cleaning up wounds, searching corpses, wiping blood off weapons, and just recovering. So move it one more.

They're back on the road for a few hours (move 2 spaces) when they run into a Vistani caravan. Now the shadows are getting longer and they're into the bottom (late afternoon/early evening) quadrant. The interaction with the caravan is friendly, and after some banter, they move on (move another section).

Now it's nighttime and they're on the desolate, dangerous Svalich Road. . . . 

\---

I like this simple tracking system because it's intuitive and works in chunks of action. I leave it out in view so my players can always know the general time of day. Sometimes they'll even catch me when I forget to move it! It's always easy even if you forget to retrace from where you left off. 

I left ample room below the tracker for a DM to check off days or sketch in a calendar. I was going to add day/month tracking feature, too, but realized many campaigns have their own calendars with varying numbers of days and months and the like. 

I realize this isn't crunchy enough for some, but it has worked well for me and my players. If you like it and find it useful, please share.",0,1585192496,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp47ac/simple_day_tracking_tool/,DnD,1
fp4746,Welcome_to_the_night,How do I properly play chaotic evil,"Once there was a powerful necromancer, whom threatened the very world. He planned on fusing his mortal instrument with the vast tapestry that was time. He was so very close to becoming the most powerful being in all of everything, but, alas, five brave hero's stepped up, and slew him in his own abode.

Years later, a child was born in a small village, with the same mark on his chest, the very same mark that the necromancer had. The mark was a sign of evil, a reincarnation, lasting for thousands of years.

But disgrace had no interest in carnage or sadism, instead the little one wanted friendship; someone he could tell of his hopes and dreams. Instead he was tossed aside, his own mother abandoned him the moment the mark appeared, his name stripped away from him, replaced with disgrace, other children were instructed by there parents to avoid him at all costs, the orphanage wouldn't take him in; he was forced to live in an abandoned farm house, forced to suffer isolation.

But disgrace carried on, to follow his dreams of becoming a jester, that would dance, and spread merriment to all. He practiced how to read and write all on his own, practiced jokes and how to dance properly, until an opportunity arose.

A local noble was holding a grand festival, to celebrate the the trees coming back from there temporary slumber, a yearly tradition. But there was different variable, something that could drag him out of the depths of misery and into the warm embrace of happiness, the nobles jester had died, and was holding a contest to find his replacement.

He practiced ten times as hard, to make sure his routine was absolutely amazing, something to wow the local nobility. But the villagers caught wind of it, and believed  he was attempting to insert himself in a position of power. They came up with a plan to utterly ruin his chances of ever becoming something more dangerous, he practiced alone, In an abandoned farm house he called home. They caught wind of his main act, he was practicing a very difficult song, known as ""sorrow in the hills"".

The night of the festival was upon them, the tents were set up (after a multitude of failed attempts), the feast prepared, with some of the most exotic meats one could imagine, and the jesters were lining up to sign there names, for a chance to become a professional fool. Disgrace was wracked with nervousness, he knew this was his one shot at a good life. He reached for his back to check his lute; which he bought after slaving away for the local businesses, perfectly fine, he had gone through hell to preserve it, and it would all pay off today.

Disgrace was practically galloping up the stage, eager for a chance to prove himself. He opened the case, his hands felt clammy, this didn't feel real, he brushed those thoughts aside and gently placed the lute on his lap, and began strumming, but, unfortunately, all of his excitement was for nought, and the strings snapped almost instantly, disgrace broke into tears on stage, much to the delight of the villagers, it was simple, while he left to work for the stores, someone snuck in and filed down the strings, until they were practically useless.

After several seconds of disgrace crying on stage the noble told the guards to remove him from the stage, he didn't resist. The festival was all the sweeter, hell they probably didn't even have to sabotage him, there were entertainers there whom had been formally trained, still better to not leave that up to chance.

The next dawn, disgrace was sitting in the center of the town, on the well. No matter how many rocks they threw at him, or how much they shouted, he wouldn't even react, much less budge. He sat there for two days straight, some people thought he died, but after they realised he wouldn't budge they just ignored him.

fp3zdz,waveringgem,"While trying to start a Dungeons&amp;Dragons Club at my University, I accidentally started a college-themed D&amp;D Podcast, ""Milestone Academy"". (If you happen to have time I love feedback and new listeners)","Hey guys, so in the process of trying to get a Dungeons &amp; Dragons club started at my university, I ended up in a meeting with the art club on campus who had access to mics, editing software, and an email list. After a brief tangent about D&amp;D podcasts, they offered to let me use their equipment to record my own if I wanted, so for the past few weeks I've been producing a college-themed D&amp;D podcast ""Bulldogs &amp; Dragons: Milestone Academy"". 

The series follows University students as I put them into a world based on college life where student loans are formed by devils, and an oversaturated adventuring market means any adventurer worth their weight in copper needs a degree to find a job. We're currently doing an ""Orientation Pre-series Arc"" to test the waters, see if theirs an interest, and for me to learn the basics of production and editing.

If you happen to have time and feel like giving the show a chance feel free, and thanks for taking the time to read through this post! Because of campuses being closed I'll also have a lot of time to respond to feedback feel free to comment or message me if you have thoughts. I'd love to know how to improve the show for you.

One group of friends does play with each other, but are actually long-distance friends that I meet on Xbox Live, and they aren't really interested in going through the hassle of including a newbie player that has to play through Skype or Discord or something.

I have another group of friends that live nearby that I think I'll have better luck with. They play over at one of my friend's cousin's house, and isn't very far away and overall it seems like it would be way easier. My friend said that he would talk to his cousin about including me...

But he forgot to ask before the Coronavirus outbreak.

So obviously, regardless of the answer, we're not going to be meeting up for any sessions for the foreseeable future, and my friend has stated that he wouldn't really be up for online sessions. He just doesn't think he would enjoy that, and I totally understand.

So now I'm looking to see if anyone on this fine Reddit would be willing to teach a prospective player the DnD ropes over an online sess? Or if anyone could point me to a good place to look for an online group, that would also be greatly appreciated!

They all rolled really good stats and are smart enough to handle deadly encounters pretty well, so I can throw some higher cr enemies at them and give them pretty good gear. 

My idea was for him to find a blue print in this dwarven mine that would allow him to make a mind controlled arrow with some of the mythril they got from a beefed up earth elemental. It seemed pretty fitting for an intelligence based crafter whose race is pretty reminiscent of Yondu to begin with. Now how would I balance it though? He's a sword and board kind of guy that really enjoys tanky with his AC, and the idea was to let this arrow be used as his attack action and would work with extra attack. Since his sword runs off of Intelligence, this probably could to given the whole telekinetic aspect. Now how would you guys go about balancing it?

Orc Subrace: Stonefang


Alignment: Chaotic Neutral


Most Worshipped Deity: Kord


Stats: -1 Str +2 Int -1 to Cha In addition to the Orc Race


Stonefang are a subrace of Orcs that were chosen by Kord, and had Gruumsh's influence all but removed. Gruumsh is regarded by Stonefangs as akin to a 21st century abusive parent: Greatful for creating them, but otherwise hated. Stonefang Orcs are distrustful of other races, especially Elves; however, a Stonefang's loyalty, once earned, is nigh-unwavering. A Stonefang's work ethic is summarized as such: Work hard, Play hard; after a successful five days of work, Stonefang orcs routinely party nonstop for the next two days. Unlike other subraces of Orcs, Stonefang Orcs are found in civilized society, oftentimes working in the military or as mercenaries. 


Role-playing Suggestions: Play a Stonefang Orc as borderline-paranoid when it comes to their suspicion of strangers, but incredibly loyal to their friends.

**Step 1:** Provide for me a detailed description of your favourite character, their appearance, demeanor, items and gear, and tell me a little about them and what made them so special. 



**Step 2:** Have a read through other descriptions posted, and please upvote those which you enjoyed the most, and if it is your particular favourite comment as to why you loved this other players character so.

fp25z0,irritated_socialist,"Hitting a wall coming up with interesting nations for the Continent of Ardos: here's what I have so far, and can anyone give me further pointers?","My campaign, my first not from a module, is taking place on [the continent of Ardos](https://imgur.com/4SFKKRV): image provided to give you an idea of the geography, mostly forests in the south and west, mountains in the middle, and grassland with some rainforest in the west and north. Also, to give an idea as to the sort of setting, all land is claimed by governments of one sort or another, with ruins / monsters / evil lairs on the periphery far from settlements, and race relations are pretty egalitarian, especially because my Orcs are INT 10 and not tied to any evil, Grummush or otherwise. No races other than most goblinoids and yuan-ti are evil by nature, and the game's audience are mainly queer, mostly marginalized people, and all left-wing, so I'm making it comfortable for them and a little upbeat-fantasy, because with these dark days, no need for our D&amp;D to be all half-orc products of rape and starving villages bereft of any hope. Not SUPER high magic, but more magical than RAW: for an example, for 2,000 GP you can get a totally-not-a-pistol that fires caster-level-1 combat cantrips, with noncombat cantrips more accessible to, say, craftsmen, many learn magic and essentially anyone who wants to has the ability to learn a cantrip or two.

I have ideas for some of my nations, first of which will be the Dulands, which is a relatively safe and urbanized place for early levels: 

The Dulands are a confederacy of allied towns, with no centralized authority, limited legal force, little military power and governed by city councils of traders, mages, religious figures and representatives of the common people, elected by acclaim. The Dulands‚Äô terrain is dominated by evergreen forests and fertile farmland, although as far south as they are, their winters are harsh. The cities of the Dulands, primarily Finster but also including Thetford, another major trade entrepot, are prosperous and have magic weaved throughout their planning, guaranteeing thick stone walls and fresh water for everyone. Their ability to continue existing, free of noble power, monstrous incursion or foreign invasion comes from their island‚Äôs blessing; six hundred years ago, after a major war, a saint-cleric of La used her life-force and magnificent magical powers to create a barrier along the island, which, when crossed by those with hostile intent, invokes a storm that sinks or repels their ship or blasts fliers out of the sky with lightning. Dulanders are involved in trade throughout Ardos, and their primary exports are magical goods, luxuries, and verdigreen, a nearly-indispensible alchemical component. The Dulands are majority human, though a large portion of their residents are of other races, primarily high elves and shield dwarves.

The Fassan Empire, or Fassana, is a military autocracy, headed by the chief general of the realm, currently Viktor IV Fassan, although House Fassan only occasionally holds the imperial title in the nation named for them. The Empire, whose vassal states include the city-state of Boisses and their recently-conquered Fassan-Nefrou, rules with an iron fist, though their rule is legitimized by the grain ration guaranteed to every resident, citizen or not, and the extensive system of trade routes, highways, and passes guarded by military forces, making the Fassan Empire among the safest places to travel, as long as you follow the extensive laws. Citizenship is earned among the Fassanas through six years of military service, involvement in three successful militia or guardsmans‚Äô sorties with confirmable combat victories, or the ability to cast third-level spells, although citizenship is less a necessity than a way of granting privileges akin to a very minor noble, including the right to claim land of your own to settle after successful expansionist military campaigns. The population of the Empire is nearly exclusively human, though successful dwarven and orcish settlements dot the Empire and all races, with the exception of tieflings who are expelled at birth, are at least legally tolerated. The countryside primarily consists of yew forests in the south, temperate rainforests in the north, and wetlands between, and the primary exports are metalwork, weaponry, magical goods and naval supplies, given the preponderance of high-quality wood. The Empire is currently at war with the Patian Republic, the Queendom of Galkia, and the Grand Duchy of Aria, the last two of whom having set aside their ancient rivalry to curb Fassan expansion.

The Patian Republic, shortened to Patia, is a relatively new state, having formed from the ashes of the dead Kingdom of Patia, whose royal line was cursed for their evil deeds. Decisions are made as communally as possible; direct democracy rules the villages and towns, while decisions on a national scale are made through a process in which assemblies, held every twenty miles or so apart, each send a representative for every five hundred assembled to the capital at the city of Merin, which then decides amongst themselves, unless a deadlock occurs and the amended issue returns to the local assemblies. This creates a realm unified in their common differences, happy to be citizens of such an enlightened state, and privy to the generous benefits the people‚Äôs government distributes; that being said, decisions are made either slowly or even slower under the system, and in times of crisis, the ability for the Patians to resolve their differences, choose a path forward, and protect themselves can be undermined by internal resentments, factionalism or simply the pace of a system involving delegates taking monthlong journeys to the capital and back. Among the concessions extracted by the common people are Ardos‚Äô strictest magical laws; practicioners of magic beyond cantrips are bound to magic-guilds which regulate every spell cast outside active combat, and the penalties for unlawful magic use are severe indeed. The Patians were the recipients of a declaration of war by the Fassan Empire, but their extensive diplomatic ties and positive relations with most Ardon nations led to the formation of a coalition with the Queendom and the Grand Duchy. The terrain is dominated by lush forests, including the pichin-trees, rare outside the Republic and producing bountiful fruits with texture, flavor and nutrition similar to loaves of fine white bread and immune to spoilage if kept dry, meaning that the Republic has much less reliance on agriculture than other realms, accordingly creating a society with much leisure and creative time. The primary exports of the Republic are pichin, artwork, luxuries, cocoa and alchemical components found in the forests.

The Kingdom of Zier is an elven kingdom among the forests of northwestern Ardos, with its population mostly wood elves and gnomes living in nature, though the urban population is a mix of all races. Though nominally a kingdom, the ruling monarch, currently Elai II Virnoula, holds most of his power through ceremony and his powerful magic, because the royal family traditionally has dozens of children, coronating the most powerful mage of the lot, as long as they‚Äôre of moral decency. The kings hold some authority, but have little influence over local rule, such as it is; Zier has few rules other than ‚Äúbe decent‚Äù, and decisions are made among the elders and mages of the community. This creates an egalitarian society, though one in which a meaningful class divide between magic and mundane persists. Zier also treats music as sacred, and thus bards or simply those talented with instrument or voice are treated as, unofficially, elders in their own right, having the gift treated as a blessing from all the best gods and wise in the lore and stories passed down through music. The culture of Zier is peaceful and anti-aggressive, and thus the nation isn‚Äôt participating in the Fassan coalitionary war, although at least part of that can be ascribed to the longstanding tensions between the magical society of Zier and the Patian society of heavy magic restrictions. The trade     economy of Zier is based on the creation of art objects, jewelry and magic, given that the forest essentially provides for the day-to-day needs of the people, and it‚Äôs against the spirit of Zieran culture to admit the kingdom is wealthy, prosperous and, if turned toward warfare, powerful.

The Grand Duchy of Aria is the most thoroughly feudalized state in Ardos. Ruled by an aristocracy obsessed with breeding and lineage, the Arian (pronounced are-y-ahn) nobility trace their proud history back to the war of conquest in which a band of ‚Äúnoble‚Äù human warriors obliterated a fledgling orcish civilization. Within the Duchy, anyone but humans are considered near-untouchables, although the existence of illusionists and disguise-masters means that those with human-like physiques can live in secret there, if they have the pre-existing assets to afford concealment of their identities. At least partially because of their institutionalized discrimination, which inhibits their abilities to conduct trade and diplomacy, the Grand Duchy is among the least developed lands of Ardos, with most of its citizens conducting subsistence agriculture, and the relative inability to fend off threats that don‚Äôt directly affect the aristocracy means that the lands are, by and large, more dangerous than the surrounding nations and more likely to allow evil beings to establish lairs and project power against the locals. That said, given the extensive use of alchemical weaponry-- fireglass, coldsnap, deathdust and others-- in the Arian conquest, the Duchy‚Äôs nobility have long supported alchemical and thaumaturgopharmaceutical advances, meaning that what little trade the Grand Duchy conducts is usually in those interests, providing cures, tonic draughts, recreational substances and deadly poisons alike to the rest of Ardos.

During the last war between the Patian Republic and the Kingdom of Zier, most of the fighting occurred in the Bonnemarch, the area of flat, mostly-deforested countryside around the grand city of Bonne, an inland hub of education and high culture. The war ended when an army, headed by the Regent of Bonne, expelled both the Patians and the Zieris from the Bonnemarch, which established itself as an independent city-state. Its nature as a buffer zone between the two nations, along with the prosperity of the land, Bonnemarch has established itself as a neutral meeting ground for different parties, whether warring states, rival trade companies, religious disputants or simply duelists for honor, heading off potential feuds with single combat. Part of the reason for the prosperity of the Bonnemarch comes from the Bonnemarch Gate, to which all nations‚Äô capitals have keystones, allowing teleportation between the Gate and the capitals dependent upon conditional permission from the Regent‚Äôs mages; through it flow every sort of goods, making the Bonne market the grandest trading stage in all Ardos and lending further wealth and glory to the city‚Äôs many universities, palaces and manors. 

The island of Nefrou has long been wracked by religious conflicts between the Rasanists of the Duchy of Corrop and the Daranis of the Diarchy of Erieria, conflicts that prevent the two from coordinating even in cases of foreign incursion. Because of that, the southern coast of the island was taken fifteen years ago by the Fassan Empire, who, realizing the fractious culture of the island, decided to construct the puppet state of Fassan-Nefrou instead of directly integrating the territory. Corrop is held by an ancient lineage of sorcerers that traces itself back to the white dragon Rasan, which ascended to godhood through their worship, whereas the nature-worshippers of Erieria are ruled by their two kings, elected among the elders of the realm-- their state is more-or-less undermined by that, as by the time a Erierian is ready to take the kingship, they‚Äôre within several years of a natural death, the sort even resurrections can‚Äôt cure. Nefrou, despite its cultural dysfunction, is rich and pleasant land, easy to farm and with fish teeming off the shore; these fish, preserved with the salt so accessible here, provide key food sources to half of Ardos, and the magical components ranging from sahuagin bile to pearls to sea-serpent slime earn Nefrouni traders great wealth. In addition to that, Mount Nefrou, the volcano that formed the island, is rich in magical crystals of many sorts; enterprising mages visit the caldera to harvest crystal for spell components, crystal balls, canter-stabilizers and more.

The Queendom of Galkia, as one might gather from its title, flips the typical patriarchy on its head. Though most realms recognize the equality of women and men, some enforce tight gender roles, such as the Grand Duchy, where women have essentially only those rights the men in their life grant them, women are politically aand socially the superiors of men in the Queendom, establishing such situations as armies of male infantry commanded and led by women cavalry. This political situation often makes diplomacy with other realms difficult; for obvious reasons this makes for a longstanding rivalry with Aria, but most foreigners to the Queendom are slightly uncomfortable at the least with the abjection of the Queen‚Äôs male subjects. That being said, the Queendom of Galkia is blessed with fertile soil, green forests, and the majority of Ardos‚Äô supply of greenwood, nearly-sacred trees that make the finest bows, the steadiest ships, and the strongest homes. That timber, along with the spices gathered in the city, which tend to shoot up around greenwood stands, make up the basis of the trade economy of the Queendom. Currently, the Queendom is at odds with the Fassan Empire, as they‚Äôve been embargoed from trading in the Boissan entrepot; a real problem for the Queendom, as they have a quality port at Fiuglia, their capitol, on the northern shore, but lack sea access on their south shore, which they‚Äôve long used Bouis for, until the imposition of the embargo on Galkian goods since Viktor II Fassan‚Äôs ascension, as his personal politics hold a special loathing for the Queendom‚Äôs matriarchy.

Great Knosia, which styles itself the descendant of the Knosian Empire which once spanned all Western Ardos, is now a remnant of its original self. The Knosian Order of paladins, which effectively governed the Empire and kept it in line with the interests of justice, peace and the common good, has devolved into a social club for the nobility, with a few still enabled to use their holy powers but most of whom are simply rich cavalry warriors without magical abilities or the moral authority invested in them. Still, to this day, the Order rules the land, and for reasons of perception and moral authority is obliged to rule in the interests of their people, though the more cynical among them jockey for every opportunity to enrich and empower themselves at the expense of the people. The collapse of Knosian spiritual authority, of course, came not with the collapse of the Empire but with the Rhysian Revolution, in which Rhys IV Andrikos, the High Chaplain of the order and one of the continent‚Äôs greatest clerics, fell to corruption and revolted against the Order, falling into twenty years of brutal civil war concluded by the cession of the new Kingdom of Rhysia to its new king a hundred-and-twenty years ago. Though most of the brigand, blackguard and bloodthirsty members of the Order went with Rhys in his new kingdom, the idea that the order was incorruptible, though upon shaky foundations already, was permanently stained by the war, and even a century later, Great Knosia has become a hub of crime and immorality outside the cities, where bandit lords, mage-tyrants and monsters more-or-less rule with impunity. 

The Kingdom of Rhysia, itself a young offshoot of Great Knosia and founded by a malign priest who named the lands for himself, are a fairly straightforward illustration of aristocratic tyranny. Serfs suffer, as the lords rule and revel, and the royal court is a hotbed of intrigue, where most of the backstabbing is literal. That being said, for a state as principally evil as Rhysia, it has the unusual characteristic of being a fair arbiter and a recognized diplomatic power in Ardos, for the fact that the Rhysian kings have decided that it is better to consolidate and make unanswerable the power they have over their own lands than attempt to expand into others, where the people are unused to the Rhysian yoke and would soon rebel. Within the borders, the constant maintenance of military forces, aimed inward, make the roads fairly free of monsters and magical dangers, but the soldiers pose the same threat as monsters to travelers, merchants, and peasants alike. The land of Rhysia, forested in the south and the greenest of the Great Expanse to the north, its grassland fertilized and watered by meltwater off the Nuraks, is fertile and rich, which has prevented the sort of population contraction that the unsuited rule of the Rhysian nobility might otherwise create. Exports revolve around agricultural products, which they ship in magically-enhanced cogs hundreds of feet long and containing veritable seas of grain and crates upon crates of preserved vegetables, along with the mines at Kalos, the greatest mines outside the mountainous regions of Ardos and the source for nearly all the continent‚Äôs wolfram, useful for manipulating magic, whether attracting or repelling it, along with incorporation into the finest steel.

The land of Nurak, as it fails a simple categorization like ‚Äúkingdom‚Äù, is a sparse, slightly-populated realm in the center of Ardos, occupying nearly all the Nurak Mountains. The harsh mountains and freezing winters preclude a large civilization from springing up there, but the dwellers of the land, primarily orcs aboveground and dwarves below, worship the mountains as their guardian spirits. It‚Äôs for this reason that every clan, and almost every adult member of those clans, is trained for war and drill for a month a year in the sort of irregular tactics, ambushes, and mountain warfare needed to defend their homes, and as the denizens have no ambition to expand beyond the mountains they call their home, Nurak is both staunchly defended and free of warfare for hundreds of years. Most of the economy of the land is based on what the mountains provide; magical remains from the monsters and beasts living in each cave, cranny and clearing, ore and gems from the rich veins of the Nurakksul, and given the glut of trained and talented warriors the land‚Äôs known for, loot and treasure brought home from the thousands of Nurakians who take up the adventurer‚Äôs life, though rarely do they stray from their beloved mountains for long. What government exists is an assembly, held every two years, between clans, the few city councils, and those who earned enough fame and prestige to stop their seating at the assembly being objected to; the assembly mostly sets priorities for production, determines trading contracts and what little diplomacy is needed, and commissions heroes for what villains and beasts the locals cannot overcome. Mutual aid, clan ties and the ancient friendship of orcs and dwarves fills in much of the power gap that exists.

The remaining states are: 
the Domain of Bhurk, which I expect to be a LN-slightly LE expansionist oligarchy with a military with many low-to-mid-level casters (well, and some high-level generals), 

Datgerdia, a CG republic of refugees from an ancient war, mostly the small races, with an economy based off luxury goods and trained monsters like griffons and ridable bullettes, 

Kuhkia, which I think will be a monastic state, where the rich land lets monastaries act as feudal centers of power and trade entrepots, 

the twin island nations of Il'har and Copjez, two warring states of yuan-ti that other major political players secretly sabotage and support to prevent them from unifying and invading Ardos proper, 

Je'Het, which I haven't fully thought through but feel like should be a theocracy of some sort, 

Brur Khar, which is an agricultural state with a massive rural population ruled by mostly-benevolent elven horse lords (think an idealized Mongolia, with steeds ranging from horses to magic mounts), 

Pholis, which I expect to be Venice-Sicily with something like an arcane Theodosian Walls to keep independent from Brur Khar, 

the Fylkirate of Skland, a maritime empire with a population heavy on dwarves, an integrated and prestigious if small population of giants, a religion encouraging raiding its enemies, with its vassals Holm (a trade city) and Ubzhall (the ancestral hall of the giants and the surrounding country) more-or-less constantly agitating for independence while still coveting the trade wealth the Fylkirate brings them, 

and the triplet kingdoms of Shem, Krystur and Thiluna, which disintegrated from the Black Skull Empire when the lich who ruled was slain a hundred-forty years ago, and haven't reunified because of religious and cultural differences.

fp1moa,RajoGuna,Farmer populations on tropical islands?,"So I have a homebrewish setting and I'm trying to figure out how much of the country side should have farms. It's a relatively unsettled tropical island chain like setting with roughly the land area of the Hawaii islands (with one main island about twice the size of the largest Hawaiian island), so fishing is pretty big as well as hunting and general food gathering and it's set up in a way that it has a lot of rainfall on most of it.

I found some stuff online that said that a peasant farmer could generally work 20-40 acres (I went with 30-40) on some manors, and roughly a square mile of farmland could feed 180 people. Using another number I found, about 6 as the average medieval household size, I figured about 100 people might live on a square mile of farmland. From all that, I got about 55-70% would be farmers. This was based on some richer manors however, and I was hoping to find renaissance numbers since D&amp;D more generally resembles that. Earlier medieval sources seem to put farmer populations closer to 80-90% of the population.

Then it occurred to me, in most places we would look at for this, they had growing seasons. On a tropical island with a lot of rainfall, they would be harvesting year round, so would as many people need to farm? And with enough fishing I wonder too how much that could be offset, but also if say 1,000 people fishing from a town or city's port might hurt the fish populations. Then of course, magic that towns might employ to help crops. In the past I had food production at about a third of the population on average, but now I'm not sure how believable that is.

This matters because I wanted the feeling of huge swaths of untamed wilderness, but still have some small countries along the shores (except for a few super isolated societies deep inside, hidden away). I've kept it way below what Hawaii historically had except in huge population drops, but I want to figure it out so I can tweak it accordingly. I know that you don't want to set *too much* into stone, but it helps me with imagining a realized world plus the players are starting to involve the countryside more than anticipated and if say something they do leads to some of it getting destroyed I want a fair and realsitic way of predicting it's impact on the market (I had previously calculated exports and imports and net food production), and I already have some farmland marked out.

fp0vap,Maaxorus,How do I go about designing a punk kinda character in a medieval setting?,"I'm currently in the process of revising an old character idea of mine. I've got the general feel and personality of the guy, but my visual design tends to be overly specific with certain details and almost non-existent with others.

Basically, he's an Elven Barbarian who is about as unelven as they come. He's blunt, impulsive and ungraceful. Due to that he was ostracized amongst other elves, which led to him leaning even harder into his unelven personality, and eventually he bailed. And this is where I realized that I just essentially made a fantasy punk.

So, without ripping off the punk aesthetic, how would you go about creating visual design for the counter-culture of your stereotypical pompous Elven society? Or, to put it a little simpler, the punk equivalent for Elves?

&amp;#x200B;

All going well I'd like to play a True Neutral sorcerer Kobold named Grunt.  Thing is, some time ago Grunt was not the little Kobold he is today. No, he was once a fearsome ancient red dragon who believed himself to be the strongest there was. So much so that he challenged Tiamat herself!  In response she swiftly humiliated him by turning him into a Kobold forever.  He lost everything, including his power, status, his lair, and worst of all, his ferociousness.

Grunt is quick to pick fights and get pissy on slight inconveniences, but the moment anything threatens him (especially bigger things) he'll squabble and beg for forgiveness (which is also a kick to his own pride).  He's all bark and no bite, but when he does have to fight, cause he's squishy, he'll be attacking from a far distance.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fear is I'll piss off the other players with Grunt's behavior.  I don't plan for him to steal or attack the party at all mind you, any assault from him at the party will at most be verbal insults and taunts (probably followed by instant regret).",5,1585178578,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fp0m3e/how_do_you_play_an_asswholeaggressive_character/,DnD,1

She's old, but she'd been imprisoned for a long time and hasn't had much time (from her perspective) to set up this new lair (40-50 years, at most). Still, she's had enough time to make some traps and accommodations. She's lairing inside of a volcano. 

My main question is: I want to have traps, puzzles and encounters in this lair that allow the lich to observe and analyze the players' combat skills: who is good at what save, who does the most damage, the way the party strategizes. She has 'magic security cameras' set up through a lot of her lair, but am having trouble coming up with some of the finer details. Any good zelda-esque puzzle/trap ideas for a volcano lair?

As I recall, I was dreaming about joining a game of D&amp;D, and wanted to use Elsa from *Frozen* as the basis for my character. Here's what my crazy dream-self came up with:

My character was a crossclass Warlock / Paladin. The classes reflected Elsa's relationship to whatever dark force that (in the dream) was giving her those ice powers. Previously (i.e., at the beginning of the movie) she had been an unwilling slave, but now (at the end) she was fighting back against said force for good. 

(As I recall, the remainder of the dream was me arguing with the GM to get him to accept my character as written--at least until my alarm clock went off 5 minutes later)

The character concept itself might not hold much water, either narratively or rules-wise, but I really like it in term of flavor: you're drawing your power from an otherworldly source, but a major change in your character / relation to it allows for your class change.

Xolg has been at war with the Races for 2 years now and the closest any one has ever been was injuring a Demon General. Each Demon General has a gemstone attached to their heart that ampifies their magic and life force but only in exchange for their very souls when they die their souls return to their bodys and they die releasing a Barrier from the Underdeath. When one general dies each also get a part of their soul making them more powerful. When all generals are dead the Barriers are opened and Xolg is free to be attacked but bewarned he collected millions of souls and his path to god-hood is almost at its ending.

fozrxb,SoyMuyAlto,Variant Point Buy System and Ability Score Arrays,"I‚Äôve started by expanding the point buy system beyond 8-15. The following shows the new range of 3-18 and their associated costs in parentheses: 3 (+3), 4 and 5 (+2), 6 and 7 (+1), 8 (0), 9 (-1), 10 (-2), 11 (-3), 12 (-4), 13 (-5), 14 (-7), 15 (-9), 16 (-11), 17 (-13), 18 (-15).
.
The following are four different ability score arrays for four different tiers of power fantasy:
- Standard Array - 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. From the Player‚Äôs Handbook, I and many others would criticize this array and being underpowered. Point buy with this array starts with 27 points.
- Enhanced Array - 16, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. Featured as an balance between the previous array and the next, this offers a slight boon to players who want more from their character. Use 29 points for point buy.
- Advanced Array - 17, 15, 13, 12, 10, 8. Crafted by the Dungeon Dudes, this is a personal favorite of mine. This gives players the jump start they want while ensuring they still have dump stats. Use 33 points for point buy.
- Epic Array - 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8. Featured for DMs and players that pursue true heroic fantasy, this should not be the array of choice for balanced games. I use this array for custom villains. Use 39 points for this array.

fozhsh,Iestwyn,I've got memory aids for describing locations and NPCs; anybody have anything for actions?,"Let me start by saying that I know I plan things out more than other DMs. Having loose ""checklists"" for various things helps me remember them. Most DMs would probably find that restrictive or annoying; if that's the case, then this question probably isn't for you. Also, I envy you for being able to DM without some a kind of mental scaffolding to keep you on track.

I also tend to err on the descriptive side. I know that some DMs try to keep things short in order to keep the game moving; I'm sure that works well for many players. I frequently ask my players if it's dragging the game down, but for now, they seem to enjoy it.

I recently discovered my descriptions/narrations were getting a little lackluster. To get better, I went ahead and researched what worked for other DMs. I decided that there were three areas that I wanted to make tools for: locations, creatures or NPCs, and actions.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the best mnemonics I found for locations came from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/895fz3/describe_the_scene_with_ease/), which used EASE:

* **E - Environment -** A basic, fundamental description of the location, usually the elements that the players could actually interact with (size, obstacles, lighting, etc.).
* **A - Atmosphere -** The intangible feeling of the area.
* **S - Senses -** One or two specific sensory aspects.
* **E - Events -** What is currently happening there.

An example that I recently used while my players were stalking through a jungle (note that it's way, way longer than I described it in-game; I almost always abbreviate in the actual session):

&gt;The woods around you grow thick and dense. The leaves start to form a ceiling, blotting out the sun, preventing undergrowth from growing too thick. The area is peaceful and quiet, almost womb-like. Heavy, humid air weighs on your skin, and sound seems to be muffled as it tries to push through. Most wildlife has fled as you approach, though several birds can be heard fluttering and calling above.

I like the help that EASE has provided. This is so much better than what my descriptions used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

For creatures and NPCs, I've taken the advice that most sites suggested (like [this one](https://thealpinedm.com/creating-npcs-in-3-steps/)) and formed my own acronym, SASS:

* **S - Stats -** The absolute basics, such as gender, race, perceived age, etc.
* **A - Appearance -** General physical characteristics.
* **S - Specific -** A unique element of their appearance.
* **S - Spirit -** Something that gives a hint of their personality.

Here's a duergar overseer they encountered a while back:

&gt;A relatively young, male duergar approaches. The dark studded-leather armor he is wearing contrasts sharply with his light, sharply bluish skin. His long, white beard is tied with a knot near his chin, splitting into two tassels that hang down to his waist. A gloved hand tightly grips the handle of a mace at his belt, clearly ready to draw it at a moment's notice.

Again, way better than what I used to do. I'm a tremendous fan of these things.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure about actions. Obviously this is most important in combat, since actions and their effects are incredibly important. It looks like the only advice anyone has online just recommends providing *any* kind of description that's more than, ""25 is obviously a hit, roll for damage, 8 is pretty good.""

For attacks and other check-like actions, I always ask for all relevant rolls before describing the actions. When it's attacks, that means getting both attack and damage rolls before I tell what happened. I also narrate things differently based on how far the roll's result passes or falls short of the DC: if the AC is 16, then I'd describe a hit of 17 differently than a roll of 24. All of this is probably obvious, but it's probably worth saying anyway.

I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has an informal list of things they make sure to include in their action descriptions. My first thoughts are action, effect, and reaction, but I'm not sure I like it. The result would be something like, ""You plunge your pick into the beetle's abdomen. There's a crunch as the chitin caves in, followed by a nauseating squish as you pierce the flesh underneath. The beetle squeals and squirms, its pincers clicking."" I *think* that's good, but I'd love some other ideas.

Of course, actions would need to be described way quicker than the other things here; they only need to be described once, while actions are constant, especially in combat. So that's another consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this question is too weird or unusual. I'm looking forward to hearing about what you guys do. Thanks in advance!",4,1585174627,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fozhsh/ive_got_memory_aids_for_describing_locations_and/,DnD,1
fozgbv,Deminos2705,One shot into a campaign idea. First time dming,"I played my 2nd game of 5e the other day, and ive had an idea about a campaign for a while, but have been reluctant to dm as still fairly new to everything.

I figured a one shot(maybe a few sessions but only 1 goal) would get ny feet wet and gauge interest in a campaign etc.
The one shot would be a group of heroes im hoping 3 to 4 players, will be sent from varioua kingdoms and Will be facing down the ultimate sin, a deamon of some sort and need to seal it away. Once these heroes do this they each take a token of the deamon back to their kingdom as confirmation of their triumph. Theres going to be 7 items in totall. Thebpc's will be probably higher level here.

If this goes well and my group wants to continue, im going to fast forward like 300ish years, and have some things happen where towns, cities etc start having strange issues and the party with newer lower level pc's will be going to investigate these issues. They will have known eachother for a bit due to being guildmates or what not, so thats at least a start. 

What I'm planning on doing is having the deamon slowly gathering his power back into these trophy items and materialising from them, as basically the 7 deadly sins. Thoughts? Items will be slightly based on player classes as I wabt them to use these items (hopefully to some extent without their knowledge and have them maybe poison their minds a bit until they get someone to check them out and figure out qhats going on)

fozei4,GrimwaldTheWizard,"Got some questions about running D&amp;D online, can anyone help?","Hey y'all, so I assume this is a common topic considering lots of people are in quarantine, but I'm planning on moving the campaign I'm DMing (5e) to an online format because my group and I are all quarantined in different areas. 

Now I'm already thinking of running it on Roll20, which I don't know how to use but I'm trying to learn atm. Roll20 is well known for its built-in character sheet system, however I don't want to purchase any content again in order for the character sheets to work out, and I also don't want to struggle through making everything in the customs menus in order to save money. 

So what I wanted to know is if simply using Roll20 for its tabletop aspect and then using DnDBeyond for the character sheets (like how we've been doing up to now) is a good idea. Will there be any issues when it comes to character/NPC rolls? Is there any way to manually put in any effects/conditions/HP changes? I really want to use this because of combat more than anything.

If Roll20 doesn't work well this way, then can anyone recommend any other online methods? We'd be using Discord for VC and such, and DnDBeyond for character sheets (as previously stated) the biggest issue rn is just combat and exploration.

fozasd,GlassBank,I have played one one-shot game three years ago and made this immediately after only to never play again. I found my old campaign ideas and decided to get back into the game so here.,"**Trinkets Of The Failed**

(There is a giant pile of dead you reach into and take one thing from.)

**1**

**Dilemma Dice** \- You pull out a blood-soaked pouch. Inside are two marble game dice. The black one gives you luck, the white one drains it.

You can get a bonus on any roll per hour. Roll two d6s, and subtract the last (W) from the first (B). Add it to your original roll, or subtract if it‚Äôs a negative number.

**2**

**All-Element Matches** \- You pull out a small matchbox with a droplet, wind, a flame, and a mountain drawn on each side. Inside there are red, blue, brown, and white matches. They each correspond to an element. There are 60 matches, 15 of each kind.

The red ones are regular flame matches. Striking a blue match creates a small stream of water to fall until the match is ‚Äúburned up.‚Äù The brown one causes pebbles and dust and the white one cause a small gust of wind, like someone blowing. Everything is match sized. All can be combined with other things for a bigger impact. Like, throwing a fire match in a fire to make a bigger fire.

**3**

**Book Of Blood Script** \- You pull out a leather-bound journal. Its cover is dark and twisted. It‚Äôs nearly empty except for some faint scratches you can barely read. You can just barely make out 9:00, Hidden, Sub, Door, and Trap.

It‚Äôs a book that turns any ink you use to write into never-drying/never smearing blood. Not very useful but neat for aesthetics.

**4**

**Shades Of Spades** \- You pull out a black glasses case. Inside are a sick pair of shades shaped like card spades.

These let you see where and how any person died through silvery print. The brighter the illusion the more recent the death. It will not show animals or monsters. The more people walk through and die in nearby spots the less time the print will stay. Basically, if someone were to die in an area where few to no people come to (like a labyrinth) their prints could last decades, whereas if someone died in a hospital their print wouldn't last a day.

**5**

**Puppy Pencil Case** \- You pull out an adorable pouch the size of a fist decorated to look like a flame themed puppy with its tail as a zipper.

Any non-magic item you fit into this case will be searing red hot when you pull it out, and any magical item you place in it is completely concealed from magical detection.

**6**

**Bonnie‚Äôs Origami** \- You pull out a stack of small, square, papers. They each give you instructions on how to make something out of origami. If done correctly the thing can become real.

You can roll a d20 to fold something out of the papers. Based on your roll the paper will become that thing with varying degrees of success. It always remains to scale. For example ‚Äú15 - it's real but loose like paper‚Äù ‚Äú20 - it's entirely real‚Äù ‚Äú6 - it‚Ä¶ twitches.‚Äù ‚Äú1 - it's a crumpled ball and you get a paper cut.‚Äù You get three sheets of paper per day.

**7**

**Totally Uninteresting Bag** \- You reach inside and pull out a strong plastic shopping bag. It‚Äôs empty but very‚Ä¶ boring. Just looking at it makes you want to look at literally anything else.

Wearing this bag physically makes you less interesting, and for someone to even *want* to look inside without your permission has to pass a wisdom saving throw of above 16.

(+1 Stealth -1 Charisma)

**8**

**Essence Of Screw Off** \- You reach through the pile of bones and pull out a cold bottle of perfume. It‚Äôs in a fancy diamond-shaped bottle with a black lace tied around it.

Once per day you can spray some of this on to let people know you aren‚Äôt interested. You are immune to charm spells and love potions.  (+2 intimidation)

**9**

**Cuddle Cat** \- As you reach into the pile of bones and rotten flesh you wrap your hand around something‚Ä¶ fuzzy. Horrified as to what it might be you slowly pull it out and squeeze it on accident. It squeaks. You look at what your holding and its the floofiest plush kitten you‚Äôve ever seen.

Cuddle Cat keeps you warm and safe and helps you keep a level head. It gives you immunity to being frightened and (+1 Strength.) Plus it's adorable and loves you very much.

**10**

**Throwing Knife Handle** \- You reach inside and grab something small and cold. It‚Äôs a pocket knife, without the blade but still heavy, you could still chuck it pretty good.

1d4 bludgeoning damage, if you hit your target.

**11**

**Otherworldly Artifact** \- You reach inside and grab a bright blue plastic card with a red and orange circle overlapping and some random letters and numbers. There are some numbers punched into the side. The letters V I S A is printed on it. You‚Ä¶ you absolutely no idea what this is.

Considering this is a treasure labyrinth it‚Äôs probably some otherworldly artifact. You should pawn it when you get out of here.

Although, who knows, maybe this could come in handy if you‚Äôre creative enough.

**12**

**Spinage Can** \- You pull out a slightly dented can simply labeled spinach.

Eating this will give you (+5 strength) for one action.

**13**

**Chains Of Truth** \- You pull out a pair of hefty wearable chains. They look like they would be awesome armor, strong and thick but not too heavy. The only problem is a warning engraved onto them. ""Device not, forswear not, for as I protect thee I forge thee in truth.""

These will give you (+3 AC) but will violently tighten every time you tell a lie and will only loosen when you tell the truth of what you were lying about. (-4 deception.)

**14**

**Smart Pete** \- *You reach inside and have trouble pulling out whatever is stuck in these bones. With a heave, you finally yank out a gigantic stuffed dragon. It‚Äôs about the size of a large dwarf. Around his neck is an amulet with a small book labeled ‚ÄúArcane‚Äù you can switch the book by a little click to books saying ‚ÄúNature‚Äù ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestigation.‚Äù*

You get an advantage on whatever check the necklace is on. You can only use Pete‚Äôs books three times per day. You have a -1 Dexterity when using him because of his size and the struggle to take him out, so maybe not the best to pull out during a fight.

**15**

**Table Spoon** \- *You pull out a wooden spoon. It‚Äôs redwood and there are fancy flowers carvings all up its handle. Engraved on the bowl part of the spoon is simply ‚Äúknock wood on.‚Äù*

If you tap the spoon on the ground three times it turns into an equally fancy 5ft round table. If you knock on the table three times it turns into back into a spoon.

**16**

**The Moral Eclair** \- *You reach in and pull out a pastry box. Inside is a chocolate eclair. It notably has no backbone.*

Eat this and regain 1d4 of hit points.

**17**

**Frozobs** \- *You lug out a case full of 6 softball-sized cubes. Upon taking one out you can mold it like putty. There is a clicker labeled ‚Äúfreeze.‚Äù*

You can mold the cube into whatever shapes you want and when you hit the freeze button they turn into dry ice, where ever they are.

**18**

**SnipSnap** \- *You reach in and pull out a pair of scissors, the handles are impossible cubes. You‚Äôve no idea how you‚Äôre even holding them. You can barely look away.*

Every time you pull them out you have to make a wisdom saving throw of 8. If you succeed they act as a normal weapon of 1d6 slashing damage. If you fail, flip a coin and it does 1d4 of psychic damage. If you fail the coin flip you take 1d4 of psychic damage.

**19**

**Life Jacket** \- You‚Äôve got some life jackets for your whole party.

They fit your party perfectly so everyone has one that fits but other than that they‚Äôre just regular life jackets. You can inflate or deflate them at will.

**20**

**A Sticker** \- You get a sticker reading ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs disappointing, much like you. Try again.‚Äù

You get a sticker. It‚Äôs a sticker. Re-roll.",4,1585173964,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fozasd/i_have_played_one_oneshot_game_three_years_ago/,DnD,1

Players start in tavern and meet a friendly elf that gives one of the players a fitting magic item

Thugs come in and capture the elf and bring him back to the BBEGs lair

Players chase them down 

Reach BBEGs cave 

Walk down corridor and find another fitting magic item in a chest

Enter the BBEGs arena and see the elf trapped in a cave as well as many other elves. (The BBEG, dragon btw, hates elves since they killed his brother)

Boss fight with dragon and free the elf

Uhm so I've been playing dnd for just under a year I think and I'm still very new, but I am absolutely obsessed with changelings. I've never been a dm and am usually a PC but I do tend to have changelings. I was wondering if there's any material that shows the relationship between a changeling and their doppelganger parent? I was mainly wondering so I can have my character's backstory accordingly for this one small campaign I'm in till the whole lockdown is over and I tried googling but I can't find anything about how the relationship would work. Would my changeling even know their parent is a doppelganger if their parent hadn't told them?

foydy0,smudgethekat,"What defines order and chaos, at a cosmic scale? How would you incorporate the ideas of absolute order and chaos into a campaign?","I find order and chaos a very interesting dichotomy. I think order is easy to envision at a mortal scale, and chaos rather difficut. Order lends itself to stability, and so more ordered societies tend to be larger. Empires are typically regimented and legalistic, but inflexible. In contrast chaotic societies tend to be more dynamic and adaptable, but less consistent. Tribes lean more towards this end of the scale.

When it comes to cosmic struggles of gods, primordials, etc., I think the ease reverses. Cosmic chaos seems easier to envision than cosmic order. But I'm not sure how to, which is why I ask this question.

The BBEG and his followers in my campaign serve *the* deity of order (and tyranny), and I'm wondering how that manifests in their philosophy. What would happen if they won and got to carry out all their plans? What ramifications are there if order ""wins"" the cosmic battle and vanquishes the very concept of chaos?

foy4oi,VioletDragonArt,Questions to Help You Better Develop Your Character,"Howdy folks, I've been seeing a lot of posts on this subreddit about character creation and I thought I would share something that I just recently updated. It's a questionnaire, I call it my player inventory, and it's designed to help you further flesh out your new character.  I've gotten a lot of positive feedback on this from my own players who have found it very useful for further developing characters and their personalities without having to answer 1,000 questions.

Feedback appreciated! Feel free to alter the questions as you need to use for your own game!

foxdhk,NickAtHootsuite,Haven't been able to play DnD in a while. Wrote a piece about what my light-hearted Halfling Wizard would be doing in the meantime.,"It had been uneasy times at Blackchasm Keep since everyone had dreamt the same foreboding dream.

Oggie couldn't quite place it but the residents seemed more... distant. Windows were shuttered, the squares were quiet, and anyone that was about had their eyes down and went quickly to their destination.

The thing that he noticed most was the absence of laughter. It was as if a gloom hung over the Keep.

""I guess an existential threat can do that..."" Oggie thought to himself as he pinned the last of his announcement notes to the school at the Keep's announcement board.

He had wanted to help, but he wasn't sure how he could do that.

The heavy silence around the normally bustling schoolyard had been what given him his idea in the first place.

The note on the school's announcement board, one of many placed around the Keep, read:

\---  
Calling all daring young adventurers!

Does the thrill of protecting the world call to you? Do you laugh in the face of danger? The mercenaries of Blackchasm Keep need your help.

Your presence is urgently required in the Garden of Fallen Heroes. Arrive at dusk for a night of heroics and wonder!

(and then in smaller writing at the bottom of the note)

Parents of adventurers welcome too.  
\---

Later that evening, just after the sun had set behind the Ishen Peaks in the distance, the first brave young adventurer walked through the entrance to the Garden of Fallen Heroes. A wooden sword was tucked neatly into their belt. Their parents a few steps behind.

The first thing they noticed as the child stepped through the high hedges that lined the garden was the beads of light that seemed to be strung from every corner. It dazzled them to look at it, and it gave the Garden a welcome glow.

Meanwhile, in the middle of the main lawn, in front of a small campfire, sat Oggie, the wizard they had heard many tales of. He was surrounded by many of the other famous mercenaries of the Keep. They greeted the youngster and clapped them on the shoulder as a fellow Blackchasm Keep mercenary. Jinglebell pointed the children towards the face painting station. Qiwa and Vork led the parents to the refreshment table.

More and more children arrived and when it seemed that no more were coming, Oggie called all of the children to come and sit around the fire.

""Well, my fellow adventurers... It is so nice to finally meet you."" He started, ""You were promised a night of daring and wonder, so let's begin!"" Sparks jumped from his fingers and rose to the star-filled sky.

""Once upon a time, in a world not unlike ours, there were four brave adventurers...""

And so, the heroes of Blackchasm Keep told stories of adventure to the children. Some were funny, some scary, but all of them were enjoyable. And by the end of the night all had forgotten, for at least a little while, about the terrible things happening outside of the Keep's walls.",0,1585167434,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foxdhk/havent_been_able_to_play_dnd_in_a_while_wrote_a/,DnD,1
foxd1l,ZeroCifer,Assistance on problematic player habits,"Hello fellow DnD nuts, any ideas y‚Äôall can give to deal with our groups issues would be much appreciated! I also apologize for the rant, I‚Äôve just ran out of ideas.

Our group of 7 + a DM (we take turns DMing campaigns) have been playing together for roughly 8 years or so, however within the past year some of our members are starting to become a issue. We are looking for ways to punish or encourage them to at the very least pay attention, we prefer to encourage rather than punish. We‚Äôve tried focusing on what backstories they give us for their characters, giving inspiration for doing things perfectly in character (making good puns, doing awesome tricks) and even giving out special home brewed magic items (always minor and not gamebreaking.)

One player is the typical ‚ÄúI stare into the void and wont respond‚Äù when it involves anything outside of battle because he‚Äôs ‚ÄúA barbarian.‚Äù Another buddy and his GF are constantly on their phones or even playing another game, for example Runescape or Sims WHILE we are in session, causing them to miss out on a lot and go ‚Äúoh I didn‚Äôt realize the bad guy I‚Äôm trying to target died.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the fact they‚Äôve become used to starting half an hour late at minimum.

Character Quirks

I carry around a wooden toy knife, it doesn‚Äôt have any use but I think that it's rather charming

I have an unexplainable fear of butterflies that traces all the way back before I could walk

I have a fingerprint of every person I‚Äôve ever worked with, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust you but I don‚Äôt trust you

I have tremendous trouble lying while at least 25% submerged in a natural body of water

I can control body temperature, raising and lowering it at will.

I get small, heatless flames flicker across your skin when you‚Äôre angry

Left hand middle knuckle: A large cut there due to a fight where a part of some dudebro‚Äôs glasses cut me after a failed sucker punch

Full back: a bunch of stab wounds which were semi ironically made

Right Horn: a sizeable indent from when someone tried to cut it off

Upper right lip: forgot from where but adds a little character to my smile.

fowz3t,MaxeIi,A Guide to D&amp;D through Discord: How do I get into a group?,"With COVID-19 spreading through the world, a lot more people have found themselves locked away and with an almost unlimited time on their hands. Perfect time for D&amp;D! However, a lot of you out there most likely have no idea on how to properly find a game and what it takes to get into a group through the internet. This guide is for you. 

*Why should I listen to you?* 

That is a valid question. I'm Max, I've been DM'ing for 2,5 years online and have found five groups through various Discord channels. In that time, I've learned what it takes to catch the eyes of people and what to look for to get the right party members. So let's get started.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Author's note: If interest is high enough for, I'll make a guide for DMs.

&amp;#x200B;

    Step 1: Find a Discord channel    

To start off: Where do I look? Reddit r/lfg and Roll20 are probably places you've heard off if you've ever asked online. This guide will only be focusing on Discord as this is my prefered place to find groups. There are plenty of Discords out there, but I post in the following:

[Discord &amp; Dragons](https://discord.gg/2q2J7r)

[The D&amp;D Plaza](http://discord.gg/EcNRgYd)

[Critical Role](https://discord.gg/criticalrole)

([D&amp;DBeyond](https://discord.gg/dndbeyond))

*AI don't personally find groups in D&amp;D Beyond's Discord, because they have a very strict group-finding posting system that I don't enjoy.* 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Author's note: Feel free to DM me other Discords for D&amp;D and I'll check them out and add them to the list if I find them applicable for this guide

&amp;#x200B;

    Step 2: Finding the right game

Now that you've entered one or more of the Discord channel, it is time to find the correct game for you.

Most game posts will have everything you need to know about them: The system, what timezone it is running it, additional rules or changes to the normal system among a few things. This step might seem obsolete, but many new players forget to read many of the things actually stated in these, which can be an annoyance for everyone involved. 

A good rule of thumb is to look at the layout of the game add. This will come into play later when we discuss applications, but how an advertisement looks and is written is very important to your first idea and thoughts about the game. If it is filled with grammatical errors or seems hastily written, it might not be the correct game to join. 

&amp;#x200B;

    Step 3: Your application     

This step is the main reason that I write this guide as a DM. Let us start with two example of applications I have received as a DM:

&amp;#x200B;

[Bad example](https://preview.redd.it/c7e2jyf5gvo41.jpg?width=943&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f545b0c664a4dfe597866ad4daeecf70ef3c48e2)

&amp;#x200B;

[Good example](https://preview.redd.it/ql89cj1rgvo41.jpg?width=908&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d14e352cff565a59e0934f465b3d4766dea64fb8)

As you might realize, the second one is far superior to the first one in every way. However, 90-95% of all applications I get look like the first one or similar. While the second example might be on the complete other end of the spectrum, you can almost guarantee that this person will get chosen 10/10 times for that. If you want to successfully get into groups, it takes a bit of time to write out a proper application, but it is worth it in the end, as you will very likely get into the group.

*Why is that exactly?*

While the first person did answer all the questions I asked in the advertisement for the game, I don't know much about that person at all. It is just like a job application, where the person on the other end have no idea who you are and it is important to sell yourself well.

*Isn't that a little overdoing it? I want to play D&amp;D, not apply for a job!*

See it from my perspective: If I were to choose between two people, one of which took a bit of time out of their day to properly write an application, and someone who used 20-30 seconds on answering, who would you choose?

The fact of the matter is that if you aren't interested in putting a little effort into your application, why would I think you would put any different amount of effort into the game itself? We all as players and DM's wish for long and great campaigns, so we try to find the best people for that. Effort is a big part of that.

*So what do I write exactly?*

If the DM haven't specified precisely what they wish for you to answer, this is what I personally ask:

 \-    Name

 \-    Info about yourself  (Who are you?, what you do in your daily life?) 

\-    Preferred playstyle  (What do you like about D&amp;D? What do you excel at within the game?) 

\-    D&amp;D experience 

 \-   Reasons to choose you for the group (Why would I pick you over others? What do you bring to the table?

You might have different opinions on what you want to share with a stranger. Name, nationality, job etc. A rule of thumb is, however, that the more you share, the better picture the DM will have of you and will be able to make choices more easily.

&amp;#x200B;

    Parting words

I hope this guide aids some of the people searching for groups without any luck. Some of you might not have had an idea of why you were being rejected. I hope this might have shed some light on the shortcommings of your applications and what to improve upon.",0,1585166165,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fowz3t/a_guide_to_dd_through_discord_how_do_i_get_into_a/,DnD,1

so how have other systems handled this sort of thing and did they handle them well from your experience? and how might paladins and barbarians remain viable in a setting where most fights would be at range? or is STR taking a backseat just par for the course when it comes to leaving the typical fantasy archetype?",15,1585165927,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fowwi2/if_i_were_to_run_a_modern_or_scifi/,DnD,1

fowpe2,Very_bad,Opinions on multi classing and banning it in your games.,"First I want to preface this that I understand why people like multi classing. Some people think there isn't enough customization options in 5e, and it allows you to more deeply customize your character to a specific build or play style. There are lots of other reasons to multi class but that's not what is important.

My problem with multi classing is that it only seems to exist to power game and create over powered builds. Multi classing is almost always better than going down just one class. My main problem isn't that they are too powerful, although that is a problem. It's that it subtracts from your actual character. Multi classed characters are so focused on the mechanics of the game that way more often than not they are complete bricks out of combat. I've seen players play interesting full class characters, and than play a chain gun sorcerer warlock that has absolutely no personality. They have fun IN combat, but are bored out of it. 

I want players to stop thinking about their character as abilities and mechanics, and as actual characters. I've noticed removing multi classing from my game has actually helped this, and I encourage others to do so to if you are struggling with this.

Playing sub optimally is infinitely more interesting than playing optimally. Characters that do stupid or unreasonable acts will always be more memorable than the ones who don't. Think about Luke during A New Hope, put away the targeting computer, let the force guide you, have fun.",21,1585165282,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fowpe2/opinions_on_multi_classing_and_banning_it_in_your/,DnD,1

He could be a born noble but doesn't have to, overall the story is still very vague.  From my experience it is rather beneficial to be more on the edge of the spectrum in a Dragonlance setting (G/E)

**Human:** is the same as always, the feat/ skill points are always great. 30ft speed, bigger weapon die.  
**Tinker Gnome:** Small, +2Dex/Int -2Str/Wis Great stats and +2 Will Sv. Other than that not much. The race desciption sounds way more manic then what I would like to play him.  
description  
**Afflicted Kender:** The afflicted Kender are a lot easier to rolepay as a normal person. Small, **30ft speed** \+2Dex/-2Str/Wis (should have +2 Cha too I think)  Plus A LOT of +2 on rogue skills and +1 on all Svs.  


**Classes:** I like the pure rogue for all the skills and I would like to try 2W fighting, but I would also like to get some spells in there somewhere. My first thought is to just go for a reflavored **Assasin**. A dip into **Wiz** is possible too. Sadly there aren't any good Prc in Dragonlance for rogues. The other core prc would be **Shadowdancer** or **Arcane trickster**, but the trickster needs too many wiz lvs for my taste and the dancer has horrible requirements and rather weak execution.   
**Shadow thief of Amn** isn't Dragonlance, but simple enough, so it might be possible-  No spells, but some bonus feats and skill boni.  


So lets assume the assasin for now. I will likely not be THAT feat starved since its more or less limited to core and the big ones are W. finesse and 2WF. The only really good dragonlance feats are heroic surge and maybe lucky. H surge is amazing but would delay the other feats early on.  


Either just rogue &gt; Assasin, easy enough but really no extra feats.  
Rogue3/Ranger2 ACF Urban &gt; Assasin : -1sneak atk dice, and 4 skill points, +HP/ 2Wfighting /Svs /Bab  
Human: Rogue3 / Fighter 2/ Ranger2 / Shadowtief - tons of feats and better BAB/Svs but not a lot of rogue stuff until later. Just listed this one for fun, I prefer the spellcasting Prcs.  


Feats: Heroic surge - A scaling effect for extra attacks/movement hell yea. Only Lv1  
Weapon finesse / 2W fighting are the most important ones.   
Impr Ini would be good later on, W focus maybe... not sure.

fovf8s,Important-Baby,Tombs of The Elend√∫r,"Hey, first post here, and it's going to be a bit long but I appreciate it if someone can help me!

I'm doing a homebrewed campaign and I'm having some problems tying my story together so I'm asking for help here. We're playing again this Friday, so I'm in a bit of a rush.

Short summary of the campaign:  
There is a black fire spreading which enslaves all living creatures, answering to the will of a cult called The Covenant.  
The party will meet an Elf called Ethel√≥n and learn that The Covenant was thought to be defeated hundreds of years ago, by four Elven champions called The Elend√∫r.

This is a lie though. The Elend√∫r was actually bad guys who worked WITH The Covenant, and Ethel√≥n was one of the Elend√∫r.

\--------

Last session the party did some adventuring and eventually reached Ethel√≥ns home.  
So, the players don't know who this guy is.  
He is going to be the end boss.

Some ideas and problems:

* Ethel√≥n needs his old staff back, which is locked in the tombs of The Elend√∫r. But I can't tell the party to just go there since they don't know who he is, and he won't say that he was part of The Elend√∫r since he thinks they could know that they were bad guys.
* The party will learn that he was part of The Elend√∫r, but I don't know how.
* I have a colleague who will help me write a letter/page in Sindarin, which I'd really want to use, but I don't know how.
* The tombs of The Elend√∫r are actually a prison, where they were locked in when they were defeated. Ethel√≥n managed to go uncaptured though, and hid in a forest (where the party now are).
* NO ONE knows who Ethel√≥n is, since he is around 700 years old, and The Covenant and The Elend√∫rs were active about 500 years ago.

My main problem is creating the next session. I understand this is not much info to go on but I'd appreciate any and all help.

The basic rules are very well written, but for people who may not continue playing DnD after the quarantine or just want to jump in for a few sessions, I thought it made sense to provide a written introduction that could get someone with the most fleeting knowledge of the game to being somewhat ready to play in just 10 (generously spaced) pages.

fov3ni,Flashpoint11,Name for a Nightmare Creature,"So I've run into an issue in that I've introduced (or rather, hinted at) a new creature in my world that is a serious threat to the party. Nobody knows what the creature is as its never been seen before, but there is one NPC that can give them more information, which they are on their way to speak with them now. The real problem is that while I have all the information about the creature, even I don't have a good name for them. Here's a bit of context on this thing.

An NPC was attacked by this creature and had their eyes torn out by it but they survived. While cleaning and treating the wounds, the party found a black ooze-like substance around the edges of the eye sockets left behind by the creature. Later on they learned that the victim would experience night terrors involving the creature attacking them in their dreams. In the moment the creature appears the victim realizes they're dreaming and goes into a state of panic as they realize they're in very real danger and could die. Their physical body thrashes and screams as they are unable to wake up without the aid of another creature in the real world.

After waking from the night terror the black ooze begins to appear around their eyes again, burning and stinging like a weak acid. Magic healing only aggravates the substance, causing it to grow and propagate quickly, but a remove curse or restoration spell will stunt it, or simply cleaning it away again. This sort of thing will keep happening as the creature attempts to hunt down its victims in the dream world, until eventually they claim the kill and consume the victim's very soul leaving behind an empty shell, a corpse with no wounds.

My thoughts for it is this:

1. The creature attacks a victim aiming specifically for the eyes as its natural weapons and extra appendages allows it to easily gouge them out and create an opening while still allowing a chance of survival. The claws have a slime covering, which allows the growth and propagation of the black ooze substance. The ooze works its way towards the brain, infesting the victim and allowing the creature to invade its dreams.
2. While it can eat normal meat to sustain itself, its true goal is to devour the victim's soul which it can achieve by killing the victim within its dreams (how that works... idk its magic so we'll go with it). It wants to attack a creature and have it survive so that it can attempt again in its dreams. If the victim dies during the initial attack, the creature can still consume something from the body but it does not gain as much nourishment. 
3. There are means of entering another person's dreams, and doing so with someone infected by this creature allows you to help them fight it off. Killing it in the dream world severs the link temporarily, giving the victim a few days of respite from the night terrors. However, the only way to end them entirely is to hunt down the creature in the waking world and destroy it. 
4. This creature is not originally from the material plane. My thinking is shadowfell or potentially outer planes, but if you have better suggestions feel free to throw them out.

So give me some suggestions for some names for this boy. The artwork, I believe, is credited to a ""mikeypetrov"" on instagram.

foutva,python_artie,Paladin &amp; Owlbear &amp; Dragon? Oh My!,"I just started playing my first-ever campaign last week. (I live in the midwest, where everything is shut down, so we've done a session probably every other day at this point.)

The session before last, an owlbear burst out of a locked room and took off away from us. The party rogue enlisted our help to try to capture/tame it. After it hit the rogue and the cleric once, everyone decided that this was a bad idea - except for the paladin. After an increasingly unlikely series of excellent rolls, Boris the Owlbear is now the paladin's animal companion.

The most recent session involved several consecutive encounters in an abandoned forest with the knowledge that there was a green dragon in the northern section. After one encounter where the cleric scared a bunch of undead away, the dragon ambushed us (keep in mind, the party as a whole is level 4 at this point - dragon bad). After an intense encounter that left 3 out of out 5 (6 if you count Boris) party members knocked out, the dragon flew away - or at least, tried to. Not wanting to waste the time just spent fighting it, my wizard fed a potion of flying to Boris and the paladin climbed on top, and they chased down the dragon. The paladain, upon overtaking the dragon, leapt off the owlbear and bludgeoned him with his heavy mace and Divine Smite.

He rolled a nat 20, and killed the dragon with that blow.

The DM did not expect us to kill the dragon; he later said it was just supposed to fly away at half health (which, in fairness, it did try).

TL;DR: 4th-level paladin chases a dragon on a flying owlbear after almost his entire party is knocked out, rolls a nat 20 and kills it in a single mace/Divine Smite blow while falling through the air.

I always wanted to play D&amp;D specifically because of stories like this - never thought it would happen so quickly, though!",1,1585159017,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foutva/paladin_owlbear_dragon_oh_my/,DnD,1

I hope you all don't mind, but I'd like to share an EPIC project that I've been working on: two Combat puzzles/traps! This is actually a collaboration with me (Wally DM) and Dungeon Dad on the YouTubes. I recorded the puzzle portion, Dungeon Dad the monster portion, and we released them today. Had a lot of fun recording these and I want to share them with every Dungeon Master and Player in the World!!!!! Haha, hope they help give you some ideas for future online gaming!

So here is what we cooked up:

Our first encounter:  Our adventurers have found the item that they have spent the entire campaign looking for. But, it is protected by a strange being that absorbs and becomes immune to their attacks. Will they defeat the Adaptor and claim their prize or will they fail to realize how to manipulate damge and find themselves falling to the blade it wields?

The Adaptor is a monster you can find in the old BECMI Master DM rulebook from a long, long time ago and u/jambrose22 did a fantastic job of converting it to 5th Edition!

[D&amp;D Puzzle and Monster of the Week - The Adaptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NKjb3YVu5A&amp;t=1s)

And our second encounter: Out here, there be catfish. That's right a Monster Catfish and it's also a trap! Trying to steer clear of the Stalking Catfish's ""spitting ability"" while trying to navigate a Water Dungeon Puzzle can be fun (and deadly) for any adventuring group!

I'm a long time DM, currently playing The Dragon Heist module as a player with some of my dearest friends but I'm having some trouble with my party.  
I'm playing an ex city guard, now grey hand apprentice, and my party consists of a paladin investigator,  a barbarian and a cleric of life (all good and mostly lawful characters).   
So long we have reached the point when the party manages to destroy the evil nimblewright,   
and in some cases we had to enter in some private property during our investigations (Gralund villa, the Zenth warehouse at the beginning, etc...), promptly informing the authorities afterward in order to prevent misunderstandings, all the times we have been admonished that you cannot break the law, and they are going to close an eye for that time, and while I know perfectly that this is to prevent chaotic stupid players to wreak havoc in the city that is frustrating the bejeezus out of my party, they started asking the greyhand for an official badge in order to investigate but being at our 2nd faction mission (third ongoing) obviously they cannot officially support us, so they get more and more frustrated, thinking that there is no way to proceed in the campaign without breaking the law and no one is helping them. I had reached a point during the last session when I had to do a 40 minutes motivational speech (real-time) while visiting the families of the fireball victims in order to persuade them that it's ok to investigate and I'm going to pay every fee for entering in private if that means no one gets killed again in the street.  
I don't know how to calm them and I don't want to babysit my party, grabbing every plot hook and trying to pull them up through the story every time, but they are my friends and I'm like compelled to do something.

fouc2p,ExKondor,PC Backstory-Driven Campaign Climax,"Hello all!

So I'm really just posting this because I'm excited; I think I've come up with a good climax to an adventure that also heavily leans on one of my PCs backstories - I'd love some extra input, however, regarding the mechanics and minutia of it. Just in case my players find this post (I don't think they will, but better safe than sorry), I won't be mentioning anything about race/classes or PC names.

PC background: He grew up in a highly structured society, where he was the son of a very prominent political figure. He highly valued academics, and was in the equivalent of D&amp;D college studying wizardry when a terrible accident occurred; his dear friend, with whom he frequently practiced magic, was killed by his hand. His culture would have him slain for this act, so his father secretly told him to flee. His father then told everyone that his son had been executed.

Fast-forward to present day, where the PC found a rogue group of adventurers (the rest of my D&amp;D) group and has been embarking upon adventures. While his PC is often scared of danger, he is quickly growing into his role as an adventurer - and not just a scholar, tucked away in a library all day.

So, I think when my PCs are very high levels - above 15 at least - I want them to fight a creature that is wreaking havoc upon part of the Forgotten Realms. I've come up with an idea that it's some sort of ancient resurrected elemental God that is creating severe weather events, earth quakes, yada yada, and is slowly destroying the world.

My PCs, level 2 right now, are currently running LMoP campaign. I want to re-institute the Weapon's Forge located in the Phandelver Mine and have my PCs forget about it - we'll go on different campaigns, navigate around the Forgotten Realms, but eventually word of this unleashed evil god will spread. They will eventually discover the only way they can defeat him is with a very special weapon that must be assembled in the forge (they will go on side-quests to collect materials to assemble the weapon). Finally, once the weapon is made in the forge and they are ready to slay the elemental God - they will receive some harrowing news; the weapon is meant to balance and harmonize with nature. Meaning whoever takes the life of the God using this weapon will also face annihilation themselves.

The weapon also chooses its owner, based on the imbalance in their soul - whomever has the heaviest psychic burden from the past will inherit the weapon. It will glow with power. It will be clear that it's meant for them. (Should I make this by chance? I'm not too sure about this part as far as the weapon choosing the owner. I feel like I have such an immense plot hook for this single PC that I need to ensure he gets the weapon somehow).

Anyway, the PCs (hopefully) slay the God by first destroying the totems that are empowering it. Then the PC, wielding the weapon, strides up to the beast, looks at his comrades with a sense of pure gratitude for all they've done for him, and sinks the blade deep into the God's heart.

The God roars, jerks, then becomes still.

The rest of the group stares at the PC as his image slowly fades away, like dust in the wind. At the same time, the sun peeks through the storm clouds and sheds brilliant yellow light onto the grassy field, lighting up the blades of grass and destroyed remnants of trees. The rest of the group follows the dust of their fallen friend up into the clouds, where it disappears.

Then, I describe what PC is feeling.

The PC feels his consciousness split into what he feels to be an infinite number. His vision and knowledge expand to encompass everything, all pain and feeling vanish in place of pure experience and bliss. He feels as if he's falling upward, but he does not feel afraid. Eventually, he sets down in the most beautiful, heart-warming place that he's ever seen in his life.

*I then ask the PC to describe what he sees*.

The PC then sees, obscurely at first but then slowly coming into focus, the image of his old classmate that he accidentally killed. He's smiling slightly and walking towards him, adorned in a pure-white tunic and holding a book. He greets the PC, says it's nice to see him.

He states that someone with as pure a heart as him should never have to bear the weight of such guilt for such a long time.

He says he forgives the PC, that he's happy here.

He then says: ""I think you'll be happy here too \[PC name\]. It has everything you could ever hope or want, this is truly a place of wonder. I'll be ecstatic to have you by my side...""

His classmate then raises his right hand, opening his book

""...but that day is not today""

A brilliant burst of light emanates from his classmate's hand. The PC feels himself now falling back towards earth, he feels his molecules coming back together, re-shaping themselves into a body. He feels his consciousness shrinking back to what it was before.

Cutting-back to the the rest of the group, after several minutes - as they begin to turn away - they see a brilliant flash of light far above the clouds and what looks to be pure-white dust descending back upon the earth. It shoots directly into the ground, the area slowly bloating until it finally bursts, sending chunks of earth high into the air and leaving a large crater in the middle of the field.

The group walks up and looks over the edge of the crater. There, naked and with a look as if a large burden has been removed from his shoulders, is the PC staring back at them.

And that's where I'll end the session.

So we start our session and her character is asking me where the bar is. I tell her, and she then decides to try to kill me...

She does of course, so I'm out of the game almost immediately. The DM works around it and has me revived after about 30 minutes.

Next play session same thing. I have my back turned and she attacks. She thinks it's hilarious and the DM is just going with it because he wants us to be able to do what we want. Once miraculously revived again after about 30 minutes I make it clear I am staying at least 20 feet behind her at all times and will run away if she approaches so I don't get killed again.

I talked with her about it and that she's taking over by attacking me and how it's not fun to just be dead. In 4 hours of playing we have only just left the town because of this.

She says since she's new she doesn't know what she should be doing and is just trying to be in character. I'm starting to think she's sabotaging the game, even though it was mostly her idea to give it a try in the first place.

fosf7x,Linc3000,A Different Take on Multiclassing,"Hey all,

So here's my thoughts on multiclassing. Multiclassing mechanically is dipping levels into a new class, sure. But in game your characters probably don't know that they are a level 10 totem barbarian lv 3 druid, or a lv 3 life cleric lv 8 fighter. In world your characters probably think of themselves as a wandering warrior of the forest, or just as a paladin who underwent their own order's training! Not to say a character can't train in multiple disciplines and think of themselves that way, or be trained by a new master along their adventure but it's maybe not as cut and dry as it appears on paper.

My take is that in world a multiclassing character would not necessarily think of themselves as multiclassing. Maybe there's an order of paladins who make a pact with great old ones in order to fulfill their oaths. Mechanically that would likely be a paladin/warlock multiclass, but in world its just another paladin order!

When a player asks to multiclass maybe don't think of it as ""okay, well how would a monk learn to use wildshape"" and more along the lines of ""this monk has perfected the animal fighting styles to the point of being able to channel animal spirits and fight as one with nature."" multiclassing mechanically is taking levels in a different class, but in game wouldn't be any different than a character leveling up in the the original class. 

Just my thoughts. There's no right or wrong way to multiclass, but I was stuck in the ""well if you want to multiclass you had better find someone to teach you this stuff in game"" even though when a player levels up no one has to teach them their new moves.

Id love to hear other folks thoughts on how multiclassing is portrayed in game.",8,1585150912,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fosf7x/a_different_take_on_multiclassing/,DnD,1

fosbas,Jpbo83,Help creating a end campaign Lich King Boss,"Hello!!

My PCs just got to lvl6 and I am trying to sort out what could be the end battle of the campaign.

They are at a point where they can charge straight to the last boss encounter or continue helping out other factions.

Here is the background of the ""big boss!!"":

His name is Drazzad, anciens ruler boss of one of the kingdoms in my land. He joined the dark side of magic, temped with eternal life. What he got was indeed an eternal life but of pain, hatred and sadness. He is forced to lead the legion of darkness back into this world. The dark powers are helping him by creating ice all over the region, blockig boats in the water and destroying crops while he grows in power strong enough to lead the last charge against manking.


The heroes had to assemble a magic sword that already destroyed Drazzad in a big war 400 years ago. They have it in hand, but not assembled.


The heroes will face Drazzad on top of an ice peak ( im really inspired by Arthas in Warcraft ! ).

I see Drazzad as some sort of a Lich King like Arthas : big frost armor, big sword, dark powers etc..

I would like to have a multi stage fight!  Maybe he could try to charm ine of the heroes to fight alongside him.

For exemple:

Stage 1 : Drazzad starts alone fighting the heroes

Stage 2 : Some skeletons would rise and fight alongside him

Stage 3 : some pillars could rise from the ground and start shooting at the heroes

Stage 4 : Drazzad could evolve?



Basically, im asking for help to :
1) help skin Drazzad from another monster and start from there
2) help make a dramatic and dynamic multi-stage boss fight

fos80t,DrunkenMagister,Great Old One's Bard,"Zolarin always loved his grandpa's tales. The stories of valiant knights and powerful witches, soothed his mind and could even make him forget his hunger in the cold months. 

Growing up he spent many nights listening to the tunes of travelling troubadours at the local inn where he worked, while he swept the floor and cleaned the fireplace, he would dream of distant land, cities in the sky and oceans of wandering isles.

He never really thought it was his destiny, he had a family to take care of and while life wasn't easy he loved his siblings and grandparents. Those stories were just empty illusions his mind used to keep it self from a boring reality.

Until one day, while walking through the city square, he heard a music like no other. A voice ancient and deep boomed through his whole body, its melody was beautiful and transcendental, its lyrics were not illusions but the Truth. Zolarin collapsed to the ground, his body shacking and his mind ravaged by a maelstrom, everything he thought real was fabricated, the reality of the universe was kept from him.

But not anymore. 

Zolarin woke up a week after that, he stood up from what used to be his bed and, looking at his startled family, began singing. His voice was incapable of replicating the beauty of what he heard but, nonetheless, his family was captivated. 

Soon the whole town heard his song and was freed from the shackles of their fake reality, now they would follow Zolarin and free the whole world.",2,1585150189,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fos80t/great_old_ones_bard/,DnD,1

formfp,jamiechalm,How do you feel about creating conflict between players about what route they should take to solve their problems? (CoS specifically),"Hi guys.

I'm running 5E Curse of Strahd for a new group. I've run Lost Mines of Phandelver up to Level 3 before, and Curse of Strahd with a different group up to Madame Eva's Tent before, so I'm not totally inexperienced at running groups. However, I have a cool idea which I'd really like to run, but I'm worried it may cause a big rift between the players.

Basically, I want to make Van Richten the player's chosen ally against Strahd. However, there's a twist: Two of the players are twin sisters, whose parents were murdered when they (The PCs) were adolescents. After this, it was revealed to them their parents had secretly been secret agents, dedicated to fighting evil. Their murder was presumed to be related to their work, but their killer was never found and it remains a mystery to this day. The truth of the matter is this: They were hunting a nest of vampires, and inadvertently were infected with vampirism. Van Richten was also hunting the same nest of vampires, and when he discovered the parents had been infected, killed them too (I actually got this idea from a guide to CoS I read somewhere). Throughout the course of the game, Strahd may discover this fact and use it to turn the PCs against their ally, or perhaps the players might discover it anyway (A diary in Van Richten's tower, for example).

I think this is a really cool idea and will give the PCs (Who themselves have dedicated their lives to fighting evil) some real conflict about whether to accept his help, or even whether they might want to kill him out of revenge, even if it makes them more vulnerable against Strahd.

However, I think the rest of the party (Which includes a vampire hunter type guy as well), knowing that Eva has told them he will be a useful ally, will definitely want to keep VR alive and will understand his actions. Has anyone else run similar situations to this, and do they tend to be fun for players, or does it just turn into a big argument?",2,1585148075,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/formfp/how_do_you_feel_about_creating_conflict_between/,DnD,1

for79l,asabassa1,Reflection Upon Seemingly Imminent (Character) Death,"I am new to D&amp;D, both as a player and DM. I had little to no interest in the existing settings available and when the opportunity arose to DM I jumped at the chance to create a world of my own.¬†

An old friend had been looking for a DM for his usual group and so, with a total of perhaps half a dozen sessions as a player and none as a DM, I began to create a homebrew setting for us to craft our stories.

As a DM with no experience, the eventual gameplay obviously began a little rocky, as is expected. Player feedback, even upon my own request to them, has been either limited or non-existent. Regardless, I recently received what I felt to be quite the compliment - they all wanted to change from bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) to weekly!

With 13 sessions now under my belt as a DM and my confidence growing each time, we begin this story as I usually do with my players; here is a recap of recent events:

* For several months, the townsfolk of Rahn have been going missing. A couple of weeks ago, they began to reappear as exquisite, lifelike, but inanimate mannequins. Accompanying their return were the Faceless, nondescript detailed mannequins which were extremely dangerous (picture the former as Old Navy mannequins, and the latter as Walmart mannequins). Over the past two weeks, the Faceless have taken control of the town. Most residents are dead, missing or have been turned into these exquisite mannequins.
* Our party arrives to find a seemingly deserted town, but logically sought out Town Hall, as it would be a likely place for survivors to gather. Here they find the few remaining townsfolk. A brief conversation reveals that all mannequins began to appear after the theft of a golden bust from within the catacombs below the large mansion on the cliffs. The bust was last seen at the local tailors shop.
* The party headed to the tailors shop to find exactly what you might expect, lots of clothes, fabrics and supplies for such artisanal efforts. Several completed projects such as dresses, suits and more were on display on the many mannequins across the shop. Unaware of the Faceless, the party investigated the shop, finding the bust but battling with a few of the now animated mannequins on their way out. With their clothes damaged during the battle, one of the party members (Rosimyra) swapped out her dress with one found in the shop.
* The party observed the bust was covered in tiny runes of an incomplete Aburation spell, and correctly identified it to be Dispel Magic. They headed down to the catacombs with the bust. During the short trip Rosimyra turned into one of the exquisite mannequins. She found herself in a dream-like version of Rahn called ""The Garden"". After exploring a talking doll (think creepier American Girl) told her to begin causing as much destruction as she could, to which she readily began to do. As she fought and died in this dreamworld, the ""Lady of the Garden"" grew increasingly upset with her behavior, and sent her Faceless mannequins to deal with Rosimyra. With each death Rosimyra found the dream world reset and she repeated this cycle of chaos and dream-death over and over with no escape.
* In the 'real world', our party began to notice Rosimyra's mannequin form take increasing damage from an unknown source. Realizing their time was perhaps limited, they rushed through the caves below the cliffs searching for a place to return the bust. They eventually found a pedestal in the center of a runic circle. They learned this pedestal and circle would complete the Abjuration runes and thus Dispel Magic. They placed the bust on the pedestal and a version of Dispel Magic exploded around them, expanding well beyond the confines of the cavern.
* With Rosimyra returned to normal, her mannequin form now dispelled, the party returned to town via a secret passage that led to the mansion atop the cliffs. Here they saved the dog of the local lord. The dog had been trapped in the house and thus malnourished due to the fact the owner had been turned into an exquisite mannequin. Rosimyra recognized the owner and mansion from her exploration within the dreamworld. Within the house they found an inert spell scroll which had once contained an extremely powerful binding spell (well beyond their current level). This spell could (and likely had been) used to trap something in a less powerful form, limiting it's abilities. The dog (via Beast Speech) communicated that he remembered a woman from town had been here meeting with the local lord a couple weeks ago. He didn't know her name but would recognize her. They also learned that the lord's young boy had died of disease several months ago.
* Led by the dog, the party headed back to Town Hall. Just outside they encountered eight dolls (one of which Rosimyra recognized from her dream), dancing and singing around the body of an unmoving young boy. Atop the roof of town hall, the town's tailor held a knife to the throat of another resident. As the tailor admonished the party for their naivety (not asking questions, not realizing there were no catacombs, etc) she thanked them for freeing her from the binding spell that held her in this form. She then transformed into a hag before their eyes. Rosimyra recognized the hags (now actual) voice from the dreamworld.
* The hag (Morgan) told the party that she could easily destroy them in this, her more powerful form if they attacked; however, she would give them a choice as she had them to thank for her freedom. She said the party choose to: Save the boy OR Save the survivors (inside town hall) Or try to kill her. But, they had to choose!
* The party did not choose, instead they attacked the dolls around the boy and the hag simultaneously. At first, this climactic battle seemed almost too easy for them, but as it went on the party soon realized that they were outmatched. With one party member Banished and two unconscious, only one remains standing against the barely damaged Hag and three dolls.

And that is where we ended the session. Unfortunately, we ran out of time during the session due to the hard stop as a result of the late hour.

Like I said before, I am new to D&amp;D, both as a player and DM. The sessions had started out a little rocky, but I had finally felt like I had found some footing. While what I am feeling now is certainly strange and new (to me), I'm confident this feeling of wistful anticipation is not unique.¬†

Did I intend for this? I don't think so. Is it possible they will survive? Absolutely! Do I think it's likely? No.

And so, I find myself in a strange purgatory - regretful of these character's stories that may or may not remain untold upon death and excited and apprehensive to meet the new characters that may or may not become alive in our world. And it's possible none of this even matters. While things do not look good for our intrepid heros, I look forward to the closure that next session will bring.¬†

While it may not be reflected here, the decision to DM and create a homebrew setting has unexpectedly been one of the most rewarding and fulfilling I've made. I hope everyone who reads this is encouraged by my experience as a DM and gives it a shot. However, if writing this accomplishes nothing more than providing myself clarity of mind on the mixed emotions I feel on the seemingly imminent death of characters I've grown to love, then I will consider this time well spent.¬†

foq96e,1Metalith1,[Homebrew] Rogue Healing Archetype: Entelechist," 

Feedback greatly appreciated.

***Rogues travel far and wide, in search of fortune and treasures. While traveling through such places, several rogues learned how to manipulate potential energies. In doing so, they gained the ability to supplement their prowess with new potent healing and combat abilities. Those that adhere to this archetype are ""spiritual"" healers, reiki practitioners, charlatan medics with hearts of gold and even some doctors in it purely for financial gain.***

**Revelation**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with Cook's utensils, if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of those proficiencies.

Additionally, you understand intrinsically how to maximize the restorative potential of any food you prepare. When using the Prepare Meals feature of the Cook‚Äôs utensils, in addition to gaining 1 additional Hit Point per Hit Die rolled, you or anyone who partakes of the meal, can reroll any Hit Die used to recover hit points, but must use the new value rolled.

**Manipulation**

Starting at 3rd level, you also gain the ability to channel, manipulate and store potential energy. You gain a pool of Vitality dice equal to twice your Sneak Attack dice. This pool of Vitality dice increases as your level increases. You refill your Vitality pool on a long rest. Additionally, whenever you would deal Sneak Attack damage to a hostile creature in combat, you can choose not to roll any number of Sneak Attack dice to add an equal number of dice to your Vitality pool. If the rogue attempts to draw forth energy from intentionally attacking an ally, finds that the principles governing the flow of vital energy can be vindictive. Striking back at the rogue, dealing twice the maximum number of Sneak Attack dice as necrotic damage, yielding no Vitality dice. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.

You are not able to store Vitality dice over your maximum number determined by your Vitality dice pool. At 9th level, once per Long Rest, whenever you would kill an enemy with your Sneak Attack, you can regain your maximum Sneak Attack dice in Vitality dice.

Your ability to channel vital energy allows you to gain several new abilities. You can cast a limited number of spells by spending a number of Vitality dice and you unlock more spells, as your abilities improve. You are able to upcast these spells by spending the appropriate number of Vitality dice for the appropriate spell level.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell level Vitality Dice Character Lvl Spells**

1st 2 3rd Guiding Bolt, Cure Wounds, Healing Word  
2nd 3 3rd Aid, Lesser Restoration  
3rd 5 5th Mass Healing Word, Revivify  
4th 6 7th Aura of Life, Aura of Purity  
5th 7 9th Greater Restoration, Holy Weapon, Mass Cure Wounds

**Luminous Strike**

Starting at 9th level, you learn how to charge your weapon with potential energy. As a bonus action, you may spend 1 Vitality die, to change any weapon(s)/ammunition you are holding in one or both hands with vital energy. For an hour, as long as you are holding these weapons, your attacks count as magical and deal radiant damage instead of slashing, piecing or bludgeoning. Ammunition and thrown weapons retain the charge long enough to strike/miss an indented target, unless they return to your hand(s) by the end of your turn.

Whenever you use the Guiding Bolt spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus to the damage rolled.

**Font of Life**

A healer‚Äôs work is never done and on the battlefield, medics and healers are easy targets and eliminating them can swing the tide of battle in favor of the enemy. At 13th level, whenever you use your Uncanny Dodge class feature, you may heal yourself. You may roll up to Intelligence modifier in Vitality dice and restore the amount rolled to your hit points. You can only do this twice per Long Rest. At 17th level, you can do this up to 3 times per Long Rest.

**Life and Death Principle**

Starting at 17th level, your mastery over vital energies is complete. You gain two new abilities; Life and Death. You can use one or the other up to a total of your Intelligence modifier times per long rest.

Life: You can immediately utilize the damaged life force of a target of your Sneak Attack, to bolster and strengthen you or your allies. Whenever you deal damage with your Sneak Attack dice, you can use your Reaction to give yourself or an ally within 30 ft equal to the amount rolled on the Sneak Attack dice as Temporary HP.

Death: When an enemy dies from one of your Sneak Attack, you can spend your Reaction, to gather up the broken remains of it's life energy of your enemy and use this energy to damage another enemy. Make an attack roll against a new target within range of your original attack. Ghostly figments of your attack heads toward the new target. You will utilize the same bonuses and penalties as the original attack, if this attack hits, roll the damage again number dice including Sneak Attack dice.",5,1585142846,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foq96e/homebrew_rogue_healing_archetype_entelechist/,DnD,1

fopxgz,1Metalith1,[Homebrew] Rogue 5e Healing Archetype: Chirurgeon,"Feedback greatly appreciated.  

***While training to focus on how to deliver the most efficient strikes to handle your foes. You begin to understand how to use that knowledge to heal instead of just harm. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse - hardened battle medic, arrogant precise physicians, mad genius doctors, angels of mercy and covert assassins trained to heal as well as harm. Using your skills to get into and out of dangerous situations, to save the lives of your allies, end the lives of your enemies and the try to triumph over the ultimate foe, death itself.***

**Medical Expertise**

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with the Herbalism Kit, if you don't already have it. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses these proficiencies.

In understanding the medical arts, you realize that a doctor is only as good as his tools. Allowing you to create a specialized Healer‚Äôs Kit known as a Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit to treat and aid your allies. The Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit has 15 uses. You gain additional 5 uses at 9th, 13th and 17th level.

Once per day, during a Short Rest, you can restore up to your Intelligence modifier uses to the Chirurgeon's Kit. At 13th level, you are able to do this twice per day. During a Long Rest, you restock and prepare the kit back up to full use, in preparation for the next day.

**Triage Specialist**

Starting at 3rd level, your ability to deal with the ravages of battle start to shine. As a Bonus Action, you can spend uses from your Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit to heal yourself or an ally within 5 ft. For each use spent, you roll 1d6. You are able to use to your Intelligence modifier, in uses from your Chirurgeon's kit at one time and the target regains the total amount of hit points rolled. At 9th level, your effectiveness to heal improves, allowing you to add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus to the total amount of hit points restored.

When you or your party take a Short Rest, you are able to use the abilities of your Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit to help triage and treat damage suffered by you or your party members. Whenever you or an ally would roll a Hit Die to recover HP, you are able to spend a use from the Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit, to have that Hit Die roll it's maximum number. You are only able to affect up to your Intelligence modifier number of Hit Dice per Short Rest. This ability does not interfere with your ability to recover during a short rest. However, if used this way, you are not able to restore uses as granted by the ability of Medical Expertise. At 9th level, you are able to recover expended uses and provide aid to you and/or your allies.

**Essence of Rapidity**

The battlefield is a chaotic place, and a healer's work is never done. Sometimes a healer has to be several places at once, to prevent the loss of life. Fortunately, your focus on speed and precision, allows you to slightly cheat the system, letting you be in several places at once. Starting at 9th level, you can spend an Action to activate Essence of Rapidity, which lasts for 1 minute. While under the effect of Essence of Rapidity, whenever you use your Cunning Action to use your Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit to heal a target a figment of yourself shows up treating yourself or any nearby allies within 60 ft, healing each of them for the same amount rolled on the dice. You can activate Essence of Rapidity twice per Long Rest. At 17th level, you can activate Essence of Rapidity four times per Long Rest.

Additionally, your ability to treat the body improves beyond the scope of simply restoring hit points. You can use your Chirurgeon‚Äôs kit to identify and heal conditions and diseases, bolster your allies, and restore life to an ally who recently lost their life. You spend uses from your Chirurgeon‚Äôs kit to duplicate certain spell effects.

**Uses Effect**  
1 Detect Poison and Disease  
3 Protection from Poison  
3 Lesser Restoration  
4 Aid *cast at 3rd level*  
5 Revivify  
7 Greater Restoration

**Necessity is the Mother of Invention**

Chaos is the rule of the battlefield. Something goes missing, you run out of necessary materials and medicines, or your equipment breaks or wears out. Ingenuity and improvisation become your best friend. If you ever lose your Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit or run out of uses, you can improvise temporary uses to cover yourself short-term, by salvaging the remnants within your kit or scraping together the material from your environment. At 13th level, once per Long Rest, as a Bonus Action you may gain up to your Intelligence modifier in additional uses of your Chirurgeon‚Äôs Kit. At 17th level, you may do this twice per Long Rest.

**Triumph over Death**

At 17th level, your mastery over medical arts allows you to triumph over the dangers of death itself. Utilizing 2000 GP of valuable processed herbs, precious minerals, humanoid flesh and a flash of inspirational genius, you are able to breathe life into a new creation; a Flesh Golem. The Flesh Golem is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. During combat, as an Action you can command your Golem to attack an enemy or defend an ally causing it to move and attack any hostile creatures within 15 ft of it or the target. If not given a default command, the Golem will defend itself and attempt to remain within 20 ft of you.

This Flesh Golem gets a bonus to its AC equal to your proficiency bonus and bonus HP equal to your Constitution modifier per Hit Dice. If the Flesh Golem is ever killed, it can be restored to life over a Long Rest as long as you have its body. If the Golem is over 50% destroyed, lost or sacrificed, it can be rebuilt over a week, as long as you have the 2000 GP of replacement materials.

You can sacrifice your Flesh Golem in an hour long surgery to restore life to a deceased creature. Grafting its flesh and transferring its vital essences over to the remains to be resurrected. Duplicating the effect and drawbacks of the Resurrection spell. Creatures Resurrected this way, have odd scars and patchwork discoloration of skin on their body.",2,1585141504,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fopxgz/homebrew_rogue_5e_healing_archetype_chirurgeon/,DnD,1

fop85q,Vulpixbestfoxy,Nornal for a party to have a heavily emotional rollercoster...at level 2?,"So, the last DnD game I was part of was a homebrew 5e on Roll 20. Its the same one that kicked me out for missing 2 saturdays. Anyways, at firsr the session had a lot of promise. Characters seemed different and interesting. Lots of good rping tho I think my blood hunter was too much an accidental edgy lizardman.

So we take onna few fights at level 1. Easily we take care of things. However, after EVERY fight the elf wizard always fought with someone in the party rp wise. His character had anmisa and woke up in a cart carried by bandits so he always brought up he had no clue who he was and yatta yatta woe with me. 

To be honest, he took up a LOT of the spitlight in the sessions. Always fighting with either our gnome sorcerer for being so cheerful and a sweet naieve caster. The dragonborn cleric for being a holy man and making him question his faith. Our human fighter for being plain and me, the quiet maul weilding lizardman for being a quiet edgelord.

Well, we had a task to go into a swamp and cure the local town of the undead source. So we go and, of course, the elf leads and talks in all encounters, never giving us much a chance to really butt in. As we get jumped by a giant spider on the way the cleric one shots it with a spell, pissing off the elf. Not surprised. We keep moving on.

We reach the tower and start going up. Living armor from the first floor slowly begin to make their way upstairs to us but nesr the stairs is some Barrels. So I begin chucking barrels down the stairs, killing one and crippling the other. Everyone else got in on the fun and we started tossing bookcases down at the crippled one, crushing it easily. Was a fun time that me and the cleric and human worked together. Elf playered chuckled but didnt join in.

As we got to the summon circle floor the necromancer appeared and, as our first BBG we were honestly a little scared..but not the elf. He just reolyied coyly at the necro and made hints that he was also a dabler in the arts. BbG summons a 4 arm bone guy that rushes our gnome and one shots her with a crit 20. Me, cleric and human rush to save her while the elf rushes up to the top of the tower to chase the nerco down. Once up there the nerco had summoned a few basic skeleton gnolls that gang up in him. Hes down and tells us to hurry up and save him. Human breaks off the fight to go save him.

With a powerful thunder maul to the head I smash the 4 arm bone boi to death and cleric raises up gnome with heals. As we get upstairs we find the human in paralysis after he used his only hp potion on down elf...who is downed again cause he didnt move. I rush to fight the one thing standing over him while the others help. Eventually as the elf stands up by taking another hp potion from someone he charges the wounded necro off the tower...for no real reason since I killed the only enemy left before his turn. 


AT THIS POINT, the whole semi fun and enjoyable rping from before quickly turns into a depressing mourning fest as we find the elf dead but cluchingna letter to our gnome. Apparently sharing a bedroom at a tavern made them...close? No sex but it was joked. So now it was the gnome crying both ingame and irl. Cleric preying and purification of his body and telling of how he swears he'll get him back to us. The human releases his angel form and beats a tree in anger and then there is me, the guy that remembers the mission and begins to collect the necros head as evidence. My charactee abd him NEVER got along and he barely did with anyone else but they expected me to be already super sad to a charscter, like all of ours, that never got time to develop past asshole elf?

At that moment every session was the same mourning over him and me, somehow, carrying his body back to town. WOULD YOU KNOW IT, he comes back to us as a fucking wraith and says revive him asap since he feels the pull of the other side tearing at his mind. He also posseses me and causes me to run into a tree. 

As we get back to town and to a temple they claim they were robbed by thieves so we need to go get their crystals back. He rages and possesses the priest and everyone pretty much Mexican standoffs. The cleric threatened to bolt his dead body. The new barabrian titan player, for SOME reason, protecting a dead body of a guy he just met. The gnome crying and trying to calm them. The angel taking the clerics side and then me, again, quiet because..just..just wtf.  I was tempted as my class tio just fucking kill his ghost. All the sessions were was drama and crying. The fun time we had before was long gone and as I was kicked from the geoup the DM told me I didnt show enough emotions as they like to play their sessions.

This was all...level..fucking...2.

Idk...maybe still bitter as fuck about being kicked due to being a dumbass in rl but man...now that I look back at it...maybe it was for the best? Was I the asshole? Since being kicked I just wonder if Im the actual bad player now.",0,1585138263,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fop85q/nornal_for_a_party_to_have_a_heavily_emotional/,DnD,1

...The idea for a one shot campaign has... Awakened.

I now wish to use the tarot of terror as a base to create a bunch of stand powers, let my players draw one, and give the rest to an enemy group. I don't plan to just let whoever gets ""Paint It Black""(donjon) to imprison anyone or ""Know When To Hold'em"" (void) to suck out souls without some restrictions. I have plans for most of the powers. What I need is help filling out the names. So I'm going to post the ones I have here, any help with names or ideas for powers would be appreciated. I don't want to just copy ones from JoJo though so no Death 13 for skull. I have my own plan for that one.

fonn4w,Cerentus,Backup player character ideas,"So i just recently started to play in my first ever full campaign. But sadly theres already been some complications such as a player not responding to if they're going to play, session zero being pushed back about a month, and session zero being cut short right after the first semi-plothook.

But that isnt what this is about. Im planning on making a backup character incase the questionable player continues to miss and was wondering if yall would be willing to give feedback about the concept.

I should probably start off by saying the other players in my group are basically all tanks, utility, and support. The questionable player was our damage so thats about where im starting. We're also mostly melee so a ranged option would be pretty nice. 

I figured i'd go with a dex build ranger. While i know a fighter with a bow is basically just better i felt i had more freedom in the background for a ranger and could play around with ideas.

 As for the backstory i was going to have him be left at a failingtemple while he was young hopeing the clerics and paladins would enable him to lead a life they couldnt give. Instead the temple saw him as a way to make ends meet by sending him off into the nearby forrest. If he found anything useful such as food or anything else to cut costs he would be rewarded with the smallest portion, and if he brings too little punished severly.

This combined with the temple being his source of education would lead to him learning his ranger skilld without knowing well how the world works to leave. However it was time for our ranger to take part in his own purging of the unholy. He would acompany 2 paladins and a cleric to wipe out all undead found in a dungeon. Ranger was sent ahead with orders to fire arrows into the joints of the unholy abominations. 

In ranger's eyes this meant he would have no kills to his name and would surely disappoint his god. However while forward in the dungeon he noticed a wooden chair in a empty room that was proportioned   rather oddly.. He decided to take investigate and realized it was a child mimic that hadn't learned much of anything before it's parents had left for new meals. Hearing intelligent mimics could speak and loved to make deals for food he figured he would offer the child protection from his fellowship and food if it came eith him. The mimic then took the shape of an unstrung longbow and allowed ranger to place it on his back, writing off the new presence as simply a spare he had found and kept.

It wouldnt be until the mimic had returned to the temple that it had realized all undead from it's dungeon had no been killed but simply moved. They now resided below the temple in storage, waiting to be sold off to any buyer in need. Finally realizing the corruption at the base of his home the ranger and his new friend set off in a fool hearted attempt at learning the ways of the world amd the gods.



Thats more or less it, and yes all the mimic stuff is dm approved since it will be exclusively roleplay. Mechanically the ranger would become a hunter variation taking the horde breaker feat  as it seemed extremely fitting.

fon3bw,Dobyk12,5E Question: Skill Versatility vs Drow Magic for a half-drow warlock,"Hey everyone,

Currently I'm trying to build and plan out a half-elven warlock and I've decided that the drow heritage fits thematically and visually with my archfey patron. Originally I was planning to substitute skill versatility with drow magic but as I built the character I noticed I couldn't get access to proficiency with persuasion (I'd like to focus on tome utility and face).   


The main issue is that only the charlatan and urchin backgrounds actually make sense for the story and I wanted to take drow magic instead of versatility. Is there any other way to gain proficiency with persuasion without taking the Beguiling Influence invocation? I feel like wasting a precious invocation on skills is not worth it and it's better to forego drow magic and just take skill versatility. Perhaps there are some feats I haven't heard about? I was also thinking of asking the GM to allow persuasion instead of sleight of hand for charlatan but first I want to see if there's a legitimate way to accomplish this. And **in general**, how would you compare skill versatility with drow magic?",7,1585126740,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fon3bw/5e_question_skill_versatility_vs_drow_magic_for_a/,DnD,1

fomdtx,Faedus,[5e][Homebrew] Remixing Ability Scores," I'm modding 5e for/with my playgroup to tailor it to our tastes.

What could be the unforseen consequences of remixing ability scores as follows:   


**Physique** \- replaces both *str* &amp; *con.*  
**Reflexes** \- splits up dex as in *gross movement*, dodging, acrobatics, stealth, initiative etc.  
**Dexterity** \- splits up dex as in *fine manipulation*, lockpicking, sleight of hand, ranged/finesse weapons. **Intellect** \- replaces *int &amp; wis* as in perception/insight = from latin ""intus legere"" i.e. ""reading into"".  
**Will** \- replaces *wis* for all other uses of like saving throws and spellcasting.  
**Charisma** \- the *cha* we all know and love.  


The rationale is:   
\- characters who need str often also need con to survive melee   
\- RAW dex is maybe a bit \*too\* useful  
\- Intellect would be ""the stat to ask the DM for extra info""  
Planning to do away with saving throws and turn them into skill checks as follows:  
 Str &gt; Physique (Motricity\*)  
 Dex &gt; Reflexes (Motricity\*)  
 Con &gt; Physique (Concentration)  
 Int &gt; Intellect (Persuasion)  
 Wis &gt; Will (Concentration)  
 Cha &gt; Charisma (Persuasion)

(I will mention now that I have never played a bard before btw.)

This character is a very enthusiastic and slightly wild goblin who happens to be an artist. Other than personality, and the fact he's an artist, I have no real backstory or information for him yet.

I've thought of a few ways to swap the typical musical performances with artwork, but I'm not sure what college would work best. (Examples being using art to mock or inspire, and doing caricatures or painting while telling a story as performances.) The ones that interested me the most for the character were Lore and Satire, but I'm still not sure about them.

So what college do you think an artist bard would best fit into? Also I'm looking specifically at the offical colleges, I looked at some homebrew ones and didn't care for them.",6,1585120121,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/folygv/good_college_for_a_bard_that_specializes_in/,DnD,1

folvaw,LawlPhailure,Opinion: Does this sound like a good idea?,"**TL;DR: Should I make a Vampire Redemption Paladin DMPC to hunt my Players Vampires?**

Currently, my players are helping me playtest some Vampirism homebrew rules that I made. In doing so, they've each made level 5 characters, modifying what would be a normal character into a bloodsucker. The goal is for them to come in to slay their vampire characters with their primary characters in a Build-your-own-badguy scenario.

This is the first time I've let them play evil characters, and they've been exceptionally violent and bloody--pardon the pun--and I can't blame them. They are currently 26 victims deep, mostly commoners to be fair, but the idea was for them to potentially play sneaky, or see if they'd play something that wasn't a murderhobo. No, they went violent and overt.

I'm not trying to come across bitter, more trying to express my surprise at how willingly they became violent superkillers. They really got into it, and, again I *really* can't I can't blame them. I understand wholesale.

All of that said, some of their victims survived, about three in total from the first night and an additional two from the second. Half the Parish were immediately convinced that they were beset by Vampires, and more to the point, took to hiding in the Church; one of my players expressed a desire to burn down one of the houses, because the outdoorsman inside took a blunderbuss to him after witnessing him string his neighbor's children up in the pines, but he didn't have access to flames. The Church is made of stone, and won't burn. The other half weren't convinced and congregated in the Pub/inn to keep an eye on one another. The Vampires managed to break in by way of clever use of a potion of growth, and slaughtered and fed on most of the inhabitants.

All of this is wrapped in a handful of caveats.

1. They are treated as undead for spells. No cure wounds. No healing word. This forces them to rely on their hit dice and the feeding mechanic to heal.
2. They lose one hit dice on a long rest, and get none back. They only get hit dice back while feeding.
   1. I basically stole and modified the feeding mechanice from PS:Ixalan Vampires.
3. They have Vampire Weaknesses, from the Vampire in the MM. They have to avoid running water, sunlight, and have to ask for an overt invitation to enter someones abode.

They're currently about to head into their third night in a Parish called Sun's Promise. This Parish is dedicated to Lathander. Because of how overt they've been, the Parishioners sent a rider to the next town over with a significant following of Lathander, and I have planned for the town to be put on lockdown by paladins and priests while they try and flush them out.

I rolled an investigation of the Crypts for the church already, and the Paladins weren't able to find the secret door that the Party's Coffins are hid behind, so they're basically making rounds in packs of three; One Devotion, One Redeption, one priest.

All of that preamble out of the way, do you guys think it would be neat to include a DMPC Vampire who is a Paladin of Redemption who is trying to weed them out as a miniboss?",7,1585119640,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/folvaw/opinion_does_this_sound_like_a_good_idea/,DnD,1

folu7n,Amateural,Opinion on Hand of Mercy Monk for a relatively new player?,"With the release of the Explorers guide to Wildemount, my party decided they wanted to start a. We adventure, and with that our newbie player has been sucked into yet another new character. We're going to try out the hand of mercy monk for her as it seems to be a relatively easy to understand fighter who also has a bit of support she's looking for. She doesn't want to cleric or support caster because the last time she did was her first character and it was rough being the main healer not knowing what to do. And it got me thinking, hand of mercy might be the perfect class for any new player who wants to help their party as well. On one hand you can use all of your ki for damage and be a flat out fighter and no-one in the party will mind because you're a *monk*, you're allowed to punch it's what you do. But if you decide to use a lot of your ki points with the healing ability (we're also experimenting with modifying the level 6 ability to have a healing option as well because I feel like it and I'm the DM so sue me) and the party will be grateful because you're not only healing them, but you're sacrificing your combat effectiveness to help them. An easy class with very simple to understand abilities that will either result in the party being thankful to you, or accepting that the martial character is being martial instead of healing when you don't feel like healing. It also gives them the flexibility to practice being a fighter one session and a healer the next if they want.",2,1585119469,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/folu7n/opinion_on_hand_of_mercy_monk_for_a_relatively/,DnD,1

folmru,Covid19RPGer,Online D&amp;D Etiquette,"Like many out there stuck in quarantine, I've been trying to find a good online campaign to pass the time. I haven't had time to play in an online game for a while, so I kind of forgot about the...hiccups that can happen when joining online games with random people.

Here are some tips to ensure that people have some good adventures in these tough times:

Players:

-Don't speak over each other, and pleeeeease don't speak over the DM. We're all trying to have fun, but let everyone get a chance to participate. 

-Be appreciative of the DM, and remember that they're there to have fun, too! Respect their rulings, though ideally, some sort of session 0 should occur to get everyone on the same page of what kind of game the DM is going to run.

-Look out for each other! If someone keeps getting talked over, say ""Sorry, what were you saying, ____?"" If someone says something awful (mean, racist, sexist, etc.) towards another player, call it out. If someone does something that makes you or someone else uncomfortable, bring attention to it. The way the DM and other players respond to such call-outs will probably give you a good idea if you want to stick around or not.

-Try to stick to push-to-talk, especially if you don't live alone. No one wants to hear your loud-ass family in the background.


DMs:

-Be specific in what people can expect from your game. What kind of game to you run? Do you usually use a grid or Theater of the Mind? Do you use any house rules? What's your preferred method of generating ability scores? What kind of players are you looking for? The more information the better.

-You might have to be extra assertive. With random players, it's hard to to know what to expect. If someone is constantly talking over other people, say ""Hold on, I think ____ was saying something"", and send them a message later telling them to stop talking over others. If someone is being ""that guy"", and putting a damper on an otherwise fine game, don't be afraid to give them the boot. If you make a post looking for players, it might be a good idea to describe what kind of behavior is unacceptable so everyone is on the same page.

-Have some sort of vetting process for potential players. The ""application"" process can be annoying, but spending a little extra time talking to potential players will help you get a better group together instead of just inviting the first few people who respond.

Any other etiquette ""rules"" that should be added to this list?",4,1585118308,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/folmru/online_dd_etiquette/,DnD,1
folmix,StaticHamster,Twenty years of gaming and I have finally ‚Äòwon‚Äô DnD,"I have reached a milestone. I have taken a character, started at level one and over the course of 2 years taken him all the way to the 20th level; and I did not die once.

The characters name was Roman Juliette. A winged teifling born to affluent adventurer parents and placed into his mother‚Äôs bard school he did not experience the prejudice that most tieflings experience growing up. There he would learn a blacksmiths trade, mostly because any armor he would find would not fit his unique body. After learning everything he can he leaves the school to learn under a new mentor and thus his adventure begins.

Over the next four years in game he would make a pact with the Raven Queen and become her champion (multiclass Hexblade Warlock). Form the adventuring company ‚ÄúWe Kill Giants‚Äù. Lose his sight to a cursed ring found in a hag‚Äôs lair. Face down a Hydra on his own and become amphibious. Reclaim a Dawn Titan from a Fire Giants Forge and return it to the Dwarves of Guantlegrim. Defeated a White Dragon in its own lair and with the Raven Queen‚Äôs help forge it into a powerful blade. Rescued King Hekaton and restored the Ordening. Rescued the town of Waterdeep from an attack by werewolves. Defeated a Tarrasque. Lived through four encounters with Acerak the Lich King. And finally, faced and defeated Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath.

His final act in the campaign was to roll for a death save with two failures already on the sheet. It was a natural 20.

Most campaigns end in TPK or near TPK. I‚Äôve gotten bored or had new characters I‚Äôve wanted to play so I‚Äôve retired ones I‚Äôve started. I‚Äôve only reached the highest levels in three campaign since I‚Äôve played so know how rare this is and can appreciate it. I‚Äôll likely never be able to do this ever again.

At the end of all his adventures he became the Raven Queen‚Äôs Champion and now stands at her right hand for all eternity.

Roman Juliette, The Blind Bard, Champion of the Raven Queen.

While thinking of how I would make a Rogue in dnd, I came up with the thought of, are Rogues anti-group friendly?

Aside from the rumors of people trolling their teammates with pickpocketing, the main reason that I began to question this is due to the very nature of the class itself. Rogues by nature are a solo class. They are intended to be ghosts on the battlefield. In and out without being detected.

While I am new to dnd as a whole, even when watching shows like Critical Role, their Rogue (Campaign 1) would frequently go off on his own, stealthing away from the group. He would usually end up getting caught and have to jump out a window or throw a smoke bomb and run away.

Rogues stealthing ahead puts the rest of the group in a situation where they can't really do as anything but watch the Rogue player go off on their solo mission.

fokxub,RollbacktheRimtoWin,Potions and Illusions,"I just discovered the prestige class ""Chimeric Champion of Garl Glittergold"", which is essentially a Divine caster that can create shenanigans with illusion spells. One of the class abilities is -  


&gt;**Brew Illusion (Su)**: Beginning at 3rd level, a chimeric champion can create potions as if they had access to all arcane spells from the illusion school. Any potion brewed in this way can be of a spell level up to one level lower than the maximum divine spell level she can cast. A chimeric champion does not have to prepare the spell to brew the potion. Instead, she must leave one spell slot (of the appropriate level) open when brewing a potion not on her spell list. She must still provide all the normal material components or focuses if needed. For example, a 7th-level cleric/3rd-level chimeric champion casts spells as a 10th-level cleric. She is capable of casting 5th-level or lower spells, so she can brew a potion from one arcane illusion spell of 4th level or lower. 

While the idea of a spook in a jar sounds great, I don't understand how it's supposed to work, mechanically. Do I drink the potion to instantly cast the spell? Do I throw it at the ground and out pops an illusion? Any insight would be greatly appreciated as I'm seriously considering making this as my next character.

He accepts just wanting to get back to his drink but as he grabs the bagpipes a sigil is burned into his hand as the gnome laughs hysterically. He whispers into Fen's ear. ""I know what yeh are and I knows ye been riggin fights this oughta even things up"" The bagpipes are cursed so that he can never take them off his person and that all of the toxins in his body are channeled into the instrument. If he ever attempts to play the bagpipes (despite having no knowledge of the instrument) the entirety of the song Freebird plays and a cloud of poison mist blows out upon completion. This is the only song that comes out of the bag pipes no matter how he blows or attempts to play it. 

TL;DR: Frog man gets kicked out of his town and joins fight club. Cheats and gets cursed by gnome. Obtains cursed bagpipes that can only play free bird.",0,1585113439,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fokqmq/fen_kragmire_the_grung_monk_who_can_play_a_single/,DnD,1

fokp8s,DarkHound05,Two of my favorite bits from my last session.,"So, due to this Coronavirus thing, we switched to an online session on roll20. It's been three weeks since our last session with everyone (three out of the five had a mini-session), so we had some really funny moments. 

Our DM went full on Monty Python with a riddle in a temple. I failed the riddle (since I didn't have the one scene engrained in my head) and got dropped into a pit. Thankfully my character is resistant to fall damage and only took 9 damage. 

The Kenku that dropped me then accidentally dropped himself into the pit on the next turn asking questions to the players. He died on impact. I took a key from his body and hid behind the door that lead out of the tombs that I was dropped into. 

His buddies tried to retrieve his body. Too bad the only key was on the body of the dead kenku. They were down the staircase when they saw me sneak out and lock the door behind me. Then I barred the door, and they will surely die down there. But that's what they get for pissing off a trigger happy armadillo that is actually made of ink, toying with him, and dropping him down a pit. 

The next bit was really funny to me, as our party is still reeling from a dividing incident due to a Greataxe of Rage, but the Barbarian, Blood Hunter and I put aside our differences to pull off an amazing coordinated kill. 

We were outside a barrack, and I ask the barbarian to break down the door while the Blood Hunter and I ready longbows. The barbarian kicks the door off its hinges, revealing a lone kenku inside, eating a bowl of worms. He says ""You know you could have knocked,"" only to have an arrow land in each of his eyes, and he slumps into the bowl of worms. 

Usually, our plans never go, well as planned. And the fact that this one want as planned made me very happy. We all couldn't stop laughing due to the quote, as he literally got two arrows in the eyes the second he finished that sentence. 

Meanwhile a storm sorcerer is about to \*#$% up our two squishies as their attempt to disguise self failed epically as one said something that gave him away and the other rolled a nat 1 against a 3 for deception vs insight.

Anyway, we see if we TPK tomorrow or not",0,1585113244,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fokp8s/two_of_my_favorite_bits_from_my_last_session/,DnD,1

fojcc1,Logical_Perspective,"Did I go too far/dark, as the DM?","Hi!

So, I run an online session for 5 players. We've been playing for about a year now, so I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on them as players.

The campaign I run is pretty dark and gory at times - it's also pretty funny and light at times too, since I believe the contrast is lovely, for both aspects. I had a session 0 at the start of the campaign, and asked them if there were any no-go areas, and how comfortable they were with dark, gore, violence, etc. They said they only didn't want rape and necrophilia. Sounds reasonable.

In the campaign so far, some of the horrible/gory things they've done are:

\- Cutting a goblin's arm off to interrogate him.

\- Slam dunk a hybrid child fey monster into an abyss bag (a bag which connects to the abyss)

\- Stabbed a pet shop owner in the face, and burned his brains out.

\- Punched multiple kids in the face.

\- Stolen lots, killed loads, maimed more.

\- Destroyed a whole town in fire and flame.

&amp;#x200B;

These are some of the few things which come to mind.

So last session, they entered  small town, after hearing it was having a vampire issue. They were told some of the children were missing, and the townsfolk begged them to find their children. They soon found the vampire lair, learned that this was just one of many branches of the vampire family, and that they were making an army, turning the children into vampire spawn, since humans are less willing to kill their own young - they make far greater weapons.

The team killed this branch of the family, and returned to the town. It's there that they found out that while they were gone, some adventurers who were injured previously by the townsfolk, and needed to stay in the town, were present when some of the vampire spawn children attacked. They captured 17 of the kids, and placed them in the town's bath house's steam room, which is the most secure place in the town (it's a touristy spa-like town - it's also fairly religious, and quite anti-vampire...). They managed to capture the kids by a couple of brave townsfolk sacrificing their lives by running into the steam room, and luring the children in by the sight and smell of their blood (these brave souls are dead, munched by the kids).

This steam room is constructed in that the floor of the room have holes in them. Beneath the floor is another room, where there are large thermal rocks, which someone places water on to, and steam rises up into the steam room above. They reach this under-room from a separate door.

The priest of the town wishes to holy water steam the vampire spawn kids to death - gas the children. There is no other way to safely kill all the spawns. The group were torn on whether to let this happen - some of the children were only 4 years old. 

I narrated the cries of the parents from outside the steam right. The snarl and hiss of the children. The savage fury in their eyes, but also... their fear. They were afraid. One of the group's members made to touch one of them, and the spawn child tried to bite their finger off.

The despair was palpable. 

The group asked the priest if there was any way to reverse the spawn state. He said only a Wish spell could do so, but the kids were powerful, and would likely soon break through the heavy wooden door of the steam room. The townsfolk could not be put into danger.

The group didn't want to be there for the what was to come. They roughed up the mayor a little, for he showed no concern at all about the children, and was very happy the vampire issue was done with. They took their gold, and left.

On their way out, one of the Mothers of the children, the same Mother who pleaded for the heroes to save her children, lashed out at them. She said it was there fault. She said it wouldn't have happened if they were quicker, stronger, better. You killed them. YOU KILLED THEM.

Then she sobbed and crumpled to the ground.

The group could only watched as the Mother sobbed

Then

The howls of the children.

Intertwined with the scream of despair from the Mother in front of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The session ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I go too far? Some of my players said I went way too dark there. They aren't mad exactly, but one of them specifically said I didn't have to be so brutal. The were fine, and they now want to crush all the vampires.

foj40x,DazzedConfused,Did I make the Right Choice?,"Are there any scenarios where it is acceptable to get yourself ""captured"" so your party can get an advantage in the coming fight? 

Sorry, this is a bit long, but in our last session, we had two powerful enemy fighters running away with a spear we desperately needed. We had worked nearly 4 sessions to get it from them and as we were so close, I was going to do anything to make them drop or lose the staff in some way. They were running out of a monastery with only a simple guard trying, and in my mind failing, to keep them inside. I ran towards one of the two, a mage, who then paralyzed me and used us to haggle for their surrender. We then proceeded to make a deal wherein we were to get the spear and myself in exchange for their ability to escape, which we gladly accepted. I did get a few jeers from the table, seeing as I pulled a Daphne from Scooby-Doo, but in my mind, it was an easy decision. What do you all think of this plan? Did it make sense for me to rush in after them or should I have waited to see if the guard could have handled it for himself? What would you all have done? Does anyone have stories similar to mine?

foj3vi,Zerohito,Advice on Seduction based Character,I'm a relatively new player (only been playing for about a year) and a new campaign is about to start and I have created a glamour bard who wants to become a famous actress. I plan on playing her as a seductive character who uses her abilities as a changeling in order to make it easier to get ahead as an actress and to get the patronage of nobles and lords.  I already presented my character to the DM and she gave me the okay and that it would be fine. I'm just nervous that this character may come off as cringy to my fellow players whenever I roleplay her as seducing someone since other than the DM and Me they're all men so I'm worried they might find it annoying to basically listen to us flirting with the characters(note-The DM and I aren't dating nor are we even interested in each other).  I love roleplaying and I think I really fleshed her out to the point that seduction isn't all she's good for but its still a major part of her character.

foix7u,dmblu,Animal Crossing based One-Shot?,"My partner's birthday is coming up and they're very into Animal Crossing. With everything going on, birthday plans have been difficult, but I figure I could run a little one-shot over Discord even if the world gets shut down. Their whole birthday has very much revolved around Animal Crossing, so I thought it would be very fun to continue that theme with the game, but am unsure of how to execute that.

Right now my thoughts are this: The setting is an Animal Crossing style town, I can use Animal Crossing (/esque) characters as NPCs, bells instead of classic currency. The town is sick- the fruit trees aren't bearing fruit, the fish have stopped biting, the plants are dying, etc. This is a big problem because of the town's reliance on natural materials. The players are mayor and villager type characters sent to find what's causing the problem.

That's the part I'd love ideas on- what would be a good conflict or big bad for this concept? My friend suggested ""an eldritch god that's pissed you're taking all the fossils that they store energy in"" which is an interesting concept but seems quite intense for an Animal Crossing set up. I'd like to have enough conflict to be a fun and interesting game, but still on the more lighthearted side of things given the theme and my players!   
Any thoughts would be much appreciated!!",3,1585105137,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foix7u/animal_crossing_based_oneshot/,DnD,1

foisw4,EsDee01,Online campaign with friends (including myself) who are new to DnD.,"With covid-19, my friends and I have a lot of time to spare. I'm willing to start a campaign as DM, problem being I've never played dnd, only watched a few online campaigns and all my friends are new to the concept of dnd (couple not knowing what dnd even is).

So far in terms of resources, pdfs handbooks and roll.20 are the only things I know of. I've been through this subreddit of what other resources I can use (strictly unpaid only) and other info. I intend to use 5e. Also keeping this campaign online via discord.

Before I delve to deep, I have some questions:
Is it possible for me to make this happen?

How much time worth of prep is generally required being I actually start the campaign? I know that characters will need to be made beforehand.

What other free resources would be helpful? Im particularly after maps that i can display and use such as cities, forests, dungeons etc. 

Any other things I haven't mentioned/ thought of that should be mentioned would helpful.

For those unaware Hector is a ""Forgemaster"" who creates undead/demonic monsters from corpses through the use of a magical Warhammer.

fohoxx,jojomott,"[Online][5e] DnD Ghost of Salt Marsh, Twice Monthly Saturday 10-2pm"," 

My name is Jeff and I would like to be your Game Master, Every Other Saturdays, 10-2pm PST. 4-6 players.

I  am interested in building a mixed group I believe a mixed gender group   is mire interesting. I have 3 people interested currently. I am looking   for a couple of women to join as well. If you are interested please   read on.

Looking for a group of  like minded compatible players. I run a balanced  game (RP, Combat,  Exploration) that can range from politics to mystery  to adventure  driven by the players in a living world (you will encounter  things you  should not tangle with and mysteries you should not unravel.  You will  know when this is the case and you will decide how to proceed.  I will  not drop you in the \*\*\*\*. But you will choose to jump into the  \*\*\*\* of  your own accord. You are heroes after all. And that's what  heroes do)

We  will start in Saltmarsh. But you will be free to wonder wherever you   please. All of the modules and more will be available to explore if you   choose. If you know where something is located and you decide to go   looking for it, so be it.

We will start at 3rd level. No multi class.  
We will play Rules as Written with variant rules discussed in a session zero.  
We will have a Session zero to create charters, talk about what we want to do as a group.  
At  session Zero a key will be to establish the relationships with each   other. You will be a group of people that already know each other and   are together for some reason. Bring ideas to the table for this session.   What interests you? See below

Your characters can be any class or any race from the published WoTC material.  
You should be interested in working as a group of characters towards a common goal.  
You should be respectful of the other players and the game. No unwanted PvP.  
You should want to help each other succeed more then you want you own character to succeed.  
No  graphic sexual content (we will all be adults. But any actual sexual   encounters will happen off screen and will not be described except in   vague terms)  
There will be violent descriptions and horror elements,  and death. But  not glorified. nd no overt sexual violence (the  occasional towns maiden  captured by flesh eating goblins, can you  rescue her? Can you save her  from the summoned creature come to do  unspeakable things. The ritual has  begun. You can hear the drums. Your  time is limited. What do you do?)  Always in context. The world is  terrifying and dangerous. It needs  heroes to make it bearable.

The  game would be in Faerune, and whatever knowledge you want to bring  to  the table about that world I would assume it was information your   character knew. It doesn't mean it true, only that you know it (It'll be   set in Faerune, but I'll add and subtract for flavor).

I  played 1 ed in the early 80's. I DMed a campaign in 2e about five   years ago. And I've run a couple of three campaigns in 5e since then.   Hoard of the dragon for a while. And two homebrew campaigns in a   homebrew setting.  
I am not the greatest Role Player and over the  internet I find it  sometimes difficult. But I try. I would hope you do  too. You don't have  to put on a silly voice, you can speak in your own  voice. But you should  try to think and speak what what your character  would. As I try to  think like the NPCs. We should forgive each other  our shortcomings when  it comes to improvisational acting and know that  as we grow as a table  we will become more comfortable with each other.

I would run the game in Fantasy grounds and over discord. Voice only. Maybe video in the future.

If interested, send me a message answering the following questions:

How long have you been playing DnD and what editions have you played?  
What are you most interested in (RP, Combat, exploration, politics)?  
Have you played in Faer√ªn before? Have you played other published adventures before?  
Are you interested in exploring older modules from older editions?  
Are you available consistently every other Saturday?  
Do  you create any type of art? (I paint water colors, write poetry and   prose (not well) and sketch)ask me for my instagram handle if you are   interested)

About the game  
What  are a couple of reason that you think the group would be together?   (i.e. you belong to a pirate crew, you are each members of a   geographical society, you were all once in an army squad back in the   civil war. Your side lost. Now you've taken up adventuring, but your all   waiting for the call of your comrades, the banners will rise again!""

fohhdh,PropsHunter,A perfect Nat 20,"So I‚Äôm part of a D&amp;D discord server, mostly because I don‚Äôt have people who live close enough to me for us to play regularly (it is also a good way to be able to play nearly everyday), we mostly base our campaign on 3.5 lore and rules, as thats when most of us first started playing and we all had the basic rule book for it still...

So my character is a mid to high level Elf Ranger, who focuses on fighting mostly at range but occasionally with magic.

Myself and another player were helping a new person to the server, with a basic low level quest, go into a cave, slay some goblins and then leave... 

The first encounter went as normal, four goblins against what the dm has expected to be three first level players, a little bit of a challenge but not impossible... especially as our group has a Wizard character who mostly acts as a safety net for Character Death or permanent imprisonment.

Anyway the trio of us continued into the cave and killed a few more goblins... until we reached the end where on a chair at the Goblin boss, he had been designed to be as powerful as two of the goblins we‚Äôd been fighting and he would be joined by two ‚Äòguards‚Äô making it another fight like the first but still with a little extra challenge as there may be less but one hits far harder.

Myself and the other player were noticing that the new person was needing to leave soon, and wanted to finish the quest, so we asked the DM if the other play (a magical class which I forget) and I could combine an attack, I shoot an arrow and he adds a basic shock spell to it.

The DM had a think and the new player said he was happy to, as he needed to go soon, so we did... did the virtual dice roll, Nat 20... 2x Damage, combined with the magical arrow my PC had been using which if undetected did 2x Damage... so we had enough damage racked up to leave the goblin boss on 2 health... a good dent in the health but not dead...

Then we added the Shock spell to it, it rolled a 3 and that was the Goblin boss dead.. from one shot and spell from two characters... the DM started to laugh about it and the new person was happy as his character quickly tore apart the other two goblins as they tried to flee...

When we got back to the home base, everyone enjoyed the story of how a mighty Goblin boss had been brought so low... and I hope you may have too",0,1585099243,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fohhdh/a_perfect_nat_20/,DnD,1

fohelb,Schindlers_Fist1,Do I really like DnD? I'd like a second opinion.,"A little context: I have some gripes about DnD, Pathfinder, and games like them. Some of it is nitpicking over stuff that doesn't matter, while other things are sweeping criticisms about how the game is structured. I had a conversation with a buddy the other night and we talked at length about the fact that while I may enjoy the environment of d20 games (teamwork, shared story, creativity) these might not actually be the kind of games for me.

I disagreed, of course, but it's really stuck with me the more I try to prepare for an upcoming campaign and I'd like to get some second opinions. Keep in mind these are mostly personal, thematic issues I have. Most of them are small and forgettable, but the big ones are:

1. I don't like magic: I know, right? I'm not outright offended to be in a game *with* magic, but so many classes have magic woven into them that it turns me off to most of the game. My interest in all of this comes from books and comics and games that, usually, have loose magic systems like DnD and the lack of rules and restrictions in those genres is infuriating. I have, genuinely, tried to play casters (full, half, and partial) but they always end up not being fun for me. In one instance playing a Ranger I would forget I had Hunter's Mark and did this for months. I'm not upset to play Fighters forever, but still.
2. I can't find a group that rewards ingenuity: My major draw to d20 games is the amount of (supposed) freedom a PC has, and because of my aforementioned aversion to magic I get immense satisfaction out of solving issues with mundane means. It's challenging and far more rewarding, personally. The problem is I simply *cannot* find people who like this approach. Whether it's modifying weapons for greater damage or ""thinking with portals"" for infinite fall damage, I consistently come up against staunch resistance to the, admittedly, ridiculous things I come up with, but when I'm allowed to do them they work. I've been told the issue is ""You're trying to do things there aren't rules for"" and that's fair, I suppose, but still a major bummer.

At this point in this little self-analysis I've essentially alienated myself from 85% of the classes and archetypes, possibly more so in earlier editions and Pathfinder. Honestly, I'd just like some criticism so I can see what the general consensus on this stuff is.",8,1585098930,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fohelb/do_i_really_like_dnd_id_like_a_second_opinion/,DnD,1

fohduz,ButtFace_12,Question about running a monster: Grapple then Burrow a PC,"So I'm going to be running soon an Adult White Dragon with a few cultists that work with it against a party of seven characters around level 8 (they may be level 9 when they get to this point). Seems to be a lot of debate about a monster grappling and taking a PC under the ground to bury them alive. Most have only been talking about an Earth Elemental's ""Earth Glide"" ability, which is pretty different to what I'm proposing now.   


So say that the Adult White Dragon grapples a PC with its mouth, and begins to burrow using its claws, wings, etc. Dragons have the ability to grapple and drop a creature from great heights, or a Sahuagin grappling a creature and trying to drown it, so what's to stop a pretty big creature to grapple something and bury it alive? Obviously it need to have the limbs free to dig, but with the adult white dragon grappling the creature with its mouth, I think it should be more than capable of digging, especially if they are a Small PC Race or wearing/carrying little to nothing.  


Here are some of the things I was thinking about, and wanted to get some extra opinions beforehand:  
1. Should I allow the PC to attempt to break free once it starts to burrow? As a free action or reaction?  
2. If they don't break free and are under the ice/snow in this case, maybe the Adult White Dragon should still move at half speed if it isn't used to burrowing with a creature? (though they might use this as a normal hunting tactic so maybe they would be fine with their normal burrow speed)  
3. When the Adult White Dragon lets go of the grappled PC under the snow/ice, what should I allow for options for them to escape?  
   \- Maybe as a reaction try to hold onto the AWD before it burrows away to try and hitch a ride?  
   \- If not, now they are stuck underground, should the be able to move since the ground has been shifted around, or should they just be considered Restrained, Prone, Blinded, movement speed is 0, any combination of the listed or even more? Regardless, I would say that they would start suffocating  
   \- Since the are essentially unable to move even more and potentially have debris in their mouth, would they not be able to use the Somatic and/or Vocal components of spells?  
4. Regardless of the state they are in once they re buried, I still want my players to have the ability to escape, so other than the option I mentioned about grabbing onto the AWD as it burrows away, what do you think would be something they could do? I was thinking they could attempt a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, and on a success, they could move a number of feet equal to half the result of the check.  


If this seems a bit too cruel to the players, lets just say this isn't exactly the traditional campaign. Homebrew with a crazy in-world mechanic that allows them to have a pseudo-wish at the cost of having random stuff happen. Said mechanic has caused, but isn't limited to, the following events: access to a Magic Shop with literally every magic item depending on what's in stock, making the BBEG's cult believe that a normal stick is the key to their ultimate plan, a friendly Fire Extinguisher, a Rapier with the powers of a Flame Tongue, Dragon Slayer, and Vicious Weapon, the potential to learn any spell 50% of the time whenever they cast a spell of 1st level or higher  


I know it's my fault for allowing that stuff to happen in the first place, but the unpredictability of the situation has allowed me to become a better DM since I felt like I always railroaded things to much. If I don't know what's gonna happen, I'd ***have*** to learn how to improvise better!  Plus it lets me play with a lot of the ***Big Boi*** monsters that most campaigns never get to see.   


TL; DR: Because of my busted in-world mechanic, I want to know how to make an Adult White Dragon encounter harder by knowing what I should rule for a Bag-and-Burrow strategy for the AWD",4,1585098842,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fohduz/question_about_running_a_monster_grapple_then/,DnD,1

fohc3m,BernardoCamPt,Is anyone interested in playing my party's enemies during fights?,"Hello! So, due to current circumstances, I had to move our group's sessions to an online environment (Roll20), and, of course, there have been benefits and downsides from doing this.

Today, while thinking about how to maximize the benefits of online DnD, I thought: ""how about I get someone, a real person, to play the enemies? The enemy commander, for example, who would order his minions around while expertly employing his own abilities, would be better controlled by someone whose mind is unburdened by simultaneously doing everything else a DM needs to do.""

""Well"", you might be thinking, ""why not just have me (the DM) play the bad guys as is usual in DnD""? There are many reasons for that, the main one, as I've said before, being the fact that we sometimes have 6-7 players and, since some of them are new to Roll20, it gets a bit chaotic if I'm trying to handle the maps, the tokens, helping them with spell questions. Therefore, I can't really think of tactics that befit the enemies, since I'm usually proud of designing exciting encounters in the sense that it is fun for the DM (me) to actually play these bad guys, which I think is important.

Also, some of my players have a bit of a ""player vs DM"" mentality still, I think, and having someone else play the bad guy might actually take advantage of this competitive edge whilst adding a layer of realism. Last reason, a bit of a selfish one, is that I'd love to watch how someone with previous access to their mechanics would play these enemies tactically, as well as my player's reactions.

So, if you're interested, or know someone who might be (a war game fan, for example), PM me please! This would mean that you'd be playing the enemies live during the session (no voice or video needed if you don't want to, just announcing your actions and/or adding flavour would be more than enough), which are usually at around 10PM to 2AM GMT.",7,1585098651,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fohc3m/is_anyone_interested_in_playing_my_partys_enemies/,DnD,1

foh4me,Talonair,Playing/utilising monsters and NPCs with high intelligence scores,"So, this may be a weird question/topic, but bear with me. One problem I've encountered is as a DM when using a monster or NPC with a high intelligence, it can be difficult to represent/act out that intelligence. Put bluntly, the vast majority of people do not have an intelligence stat of 20+, so how do you play a creature like a lich that is more intelligent than you are?

Do you 'allow' the monster to metagame a little (i.e., allowing knowledge you as the DM have have bearing on the actions of the monster)? Do you retcon in contingencies for eventualities that such an intelligent creature would have forseen?

fogeyu,KitsunaKuraichi,Missed concentration checks last game that could have changed the battle. Should I say something?,"Much more to this than the title.

Last game I got ambushed by a creature solo. I was tearing into it and the creature needed me out of there.

The turn before it cast Gate behind me. I was unaware of this.

Then its my turn and I did some massive damage. Which should have required concentration checks. But I didn't know a concentration spell had been cast and the DM forgot.

Next turn it beat me in athletics and shoved me through. 

I was so shocked that it beat my massive athletics check (35. Rage + Expertise in athletics at level 17) and that I got thrown into another plane that I didn't think about it in the moment. I started thinking of ways to tell the party instead.

The DM is aware that our Wizard had Gate so I managed to give them my full name through sending and then got summoned back (though I could have lost some of my magic stuff due to tumbling through some weird place. If that was the case then I would say something).

The only thing that was lost was that this creature got away and it is connected to a guy we are trying to catch. (Which I only found out as it threw me in the gate. So, I may not know that if we retcon.)

This happened at the very tale end of the session. So we wouldn't be going back a lot of time. The last 5 minutes in-game if that much.

Is it worth bringing this up or in bad form to tell this to the DM? Or should I leave it be and move on next session? 

Killing this creature can get me a really good item (homebrew) or I could capture it for information (though I planned to kill it originally. If I don't know its connection then I have to kill it). 

It was a super cool but terrifying moment to be gated by ultimately it shouldn't have happened unless the creature passed its concentration checks (one of which was around 23 and the rest 15 at least).",3,1585095140,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fogeyu/missed_concentration_checks_last_game_that_could/,DnD,1

fof9o6,Friday_Sommers96er,Advice on Elfhunt 5e,"We played the Elfhunt one shot recently, which is set in Camp Highmoore in the jungles of Chult. The party is tasked with finding an elf named Imis Elvan and bringing her to justice. There are multiple endings, but my party chose to help Imis Elvan defeat Chief Fillip Moonweaver and resolve the story that way.

My issue is that in the notes I couldn't see any notes on Chief Highmoore himself. He was only mentioned briefly in certain sections to tell players that he was in charge of Camp Highmoore. I couldn't role play him at all in Elfhunt so to keep the game moving I decided to be open with the players and tell them that I wasn't sure who or where Chief Highmoore was. For the purpose of the campaign we'll say he's not here. 

Well, cue the ending and Imis Elvan kills Chief Fillip and in the heat of the moment I made Imis Elvan the leader of Camp Highmoore without thinking. My players absolutely loved her as an NPC so they were cheering and admittedly so was I, until seconds later they wanted to play another campaign set in Camp Highmoore. 

Turns out heaps exist. 

So now that in our canon I've made Imis Elvan the leader of Camp Highmoore, do I essentially have to homebrew each Jungle of Chult campaign from here on out? What are some good suggestions to keep our canon alive?

TL;DR
Played one shot in Jungles of Chult and made the BBEG the leader of Camp Highmoore without thinking about the fact it already had a chief. How do I keep our canon alive in the next one shot?",0,1585091047,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fof9o6/advice_on_elfhunt_5e/,DnD,1

foemuy,donnieZizzle,[X-Post from r/MilitaryStories] How I Saved My Boot Platoon From Final Inspection," So  I went through Marine boot camp in 2005. I was half decent at flying  under the radar, and was a scribe and artist recruit. I was also a fully  actualized nerd.

As you may  already know, Marines love inspections, and we had one in parade  formation every week starting in the second month, culminating in a  final inspection about a week before graduation. We had gotten our  Service Alphas a few weeks prior, and those had to be perfect. Our  rifles had to be perfect. Most importantly, we had to maintain military  bearing (no expression, no reaction) through the inspection and while  answering any recruit knowledge questions that the inspector quizzes you  on.

It's very important to note,  you cannot fail the final inspection for any reason other than losing  your bearing. You can be told you have to fix things, and if you get  more than one or two, your life is going to suck when you are given back  into the tender care of your drill instructors. But you can't fail. And  if you get knowledge questions wrong, well if you get them wrong you're  a retard and everyone expected it anyway. You've been chanting these  questions and answers ad nauseum for months.

So  final inspection starts strong. I'm in second squad about two thirds of  the way down the line. In first squad, one position to my right is a  recruit we will call Post. He is tall, lanky, and dumb as a wooden post.  The Captain carrying out the inspection comes to attention in front of  Post. Post does a decent present arms and manages to get back to  attention while the captain looks over the weapon and starts asking  questions. He gets. Every. Single. One. Wrong. It's baffling, truly a  triumph of idiocy. But he keeps his bearing. He is sweating, and from my  position behind them I can see little nervous twitches. But it looks  like he's going to make it out okay.

Captain:  So, Private Post, you've gotten every knowledge question wrong. But I'm  going to give you one more chance. If you can get this one question  right, you will pass my inspection, otherwise, you will fail.

(The Captain, obviously bored with this whole affair, has decided to fuck with Post. As is right and proper)

Captain: Who carries the NCO Sword?

Somehow,  from behind, I am absolutely sure that Post's eyes are frantically  darting around trying to find the answer written on the parade ground,  or in the sky, or just anywhere.

Post: Uhm, Petty Officers, sir?

The Captain let's out one muffled squeak of a guffaw and hands the rifle back.

Captain:  That is incorrect Private. NCO's, or Non-commissioned officers, carry  the NCO Sword. Also, your National Defense Ribbon is upside down.

Oh God I pray that he came up with that on the fly, but we do not live in a just world.

And  with that the Captain marches to the next recruit. All the while my  Senior Drill Instructor, a grizzled old Staff Sergeant with a break of a  nose is glaring hate at Post because, really now, how can you be that  stupid?

So things continue until the Captain comes to me. I snap to attention, present arms, and rattle off the required phrase.

Smartass: Private First Class Smartass, 267x, Cryptologic Linguist Middle Eastern Specialty, sir!

Quite the mouthful, but I got it out.

Captain: Cryptologic Linguist huh? Sounds smart. Are you smart, Smartass?

Obviously the Captain is very bored.

Smartass: That's what the tests say, sir!

Every  recruit's butthole clenches but my own, for I do not see the trap I  have set for myself. I do not yet smell the shit into which I have  stepped.

Captain: Reeaaally? Okay, okay. Well tell me this Smartass. And don't lie to me, you wouldn't lie to me, right Smartass?

I  am still blissfully ignorant, nor have I noticed the glare from my  Senior Drill Instructor which promises hours of fun after this is over.

Smartass: No sir!

Also,  I should mention, that while the Captain's tone is conversational, the  recruits are yelling everything at the top of there lungs, into the face  of the man who is less than two feet in front of them. As is right and  proper.

Captain: Alright Smartass, were you in the chess club in high school?

He is trying to set me up! You see it. With hindsight, I see it. But in the moment, I just bulled through.

Smartass: No sir! DND, sir!

Oh crap.

Captain: DND, what the fuck is DND recruit?

We've become a recruit again, this can't be good.

Smartass: Dungeons and Dragons, Sir!

And  then it happen, like a crack that slowly forms in a dam, but suddenly  becomes a flooding torrent of water. The Captain snorts and his  shoulders convulse, and then he burst into uncontrollable laughter,  bending over with the force of it. My Senior Drill Instructor has pulled  his Smokey Bear down and his shoulders are rocking in barely controlled  mirth.

Without looking up, the  Captain thrusts my rifle back into my hands, smacking me in the chest  with it, and storms off, barely turning it into a march as he  disappears.

My Senior Drill Instructor returns to the Platoon Commander's position in front of the formation, and calls: Platoon, rest!

And  every recruit in a 6 recruit radius doubles over laughing. They have  kept their feet shoulder width apart. Their left hands are still in the  smalls of their back. Their right hands are still firmly gripping their  rifle barrels, angled forward.

But  none of them are upright, none of them are quiet. They are gasping,  tearing up at their mirth and the release of tension with this last  inspection being cut short. Over half the Platoon was still waiting to  be inspected, but there will be no further inspection this day, not for  my Platoon at least.

But I never lost my bearing, so I guess I passed.

post script:

You  might think that I got absolutely destroyed, slayed for hours on end as  soon as I returned to the Squad Bay. But in this assumption, you'd be  wrong. We waited for the much longer inspections of the other Platoons  to finish in silence, and marched back to our Squad Bays to get out of  our Service Alphas and return to normal training. And no one said  anything about it to me. Not the other recruits, not my Drill  Instructors. Surely we are just waiting for the other foot to fall?

I  was Firewatch for meals though, and this is a prime opportunity for  Drill Instructors or other Company Officers to come mess with you, maybe  the Captain whom I had bested?

But  no, our second Drill Instructor (we had four, so he was second most  senior), came in during my watch, a beaming smile on his face.

And all he said to me was: Dungeons and Dragons, really?

And then he walked into his office, and it was never spoken of again.

foed69,Nicholas_TW,Why I prefer Milestone Leveling (Rant/Essay),"**(Before I start, I apologize ahead of time if this post sounds kind of arrogant or mean; I more or less ended up mimicking the writing style of theangrydm's blog**  [**https://theangrygm.com/**](https://theangrygm.com/)  **. I'm not trying to say that you're 'wrong' if you disagree with me and apologize if anyone feels attacked by my assertions).**

&amp;#x200B;

My entire friend group started using Milestone leveling recently and hasn't looked back, universally agreeing it just sort of felt better than meticulously tracking exp. Then I played with a new GM for the first time in a couple of years from a different group, and at the end of the session he said ""Okay, so, for fighting five CR 3's, that gives you all... 700 exp."" And I just sort of sat there, dumbfounded because... EXP. IHaventHeardThatNameInALongTime.gif

He then turned and explained to me, ""I use the EXP rules in the book. But, to make sure players don't just spend all their time killing the same couple of enemies, I also award bonus EXP for completing quests and things.""

I didn't say anything (just wrote down the EXP I gained that session), but for some reason that explanation *really* annoyed me and it took a few days to really figure out why.

Basically, it sort of belies an underlying mindset the GM has, which is that he's worried his players care more about getting higher levels and increasing the numbers on their character sheets rather than actually engaging with the story and content he had prepared. Which, if he's concerned his players would rather spend their *very* limited time in his game killing goblins or whatever, then he probably thinks either

1) His story/dungeons just aren't very good, thus he has to give incentive for participating, or,

2) Those players should be playing Diablo or WoW or some other game about grinding for EXP.

I also think it bothered me because I just generally don't like EXP as a system, and vastly prefer milestone. It honestly confuses me that milestone isn't the default, and EXP isn't the weird overcomplicated variant rule used by GMs who prefer more crunchy games (like 5e's regular encumbrance vs variant encumbrance).

Milestone is great because not only is it easier to keep track of (No more nitpicking when EXP was gained and how much, no asking the GM if he remembered to calculate the exp for certain traps or encounters, etc), but, most importantly:

**It explicitly ties leveling to plot progression**.

With EXP, unless you give a ton of EXP for every major boss or you keep meticulous track of EXP gains and make sure players fight exactly what they need to so that they level up after pivotal moments, leveling and plot progression are only loosely tied together. A player MIGHT level up after avenging their father and saving their village and becoming Hokage or whatever, but they also might level up fighting some random goblins during their travel. Or in some Colosseum battle. Using milestones ensures that players progress mechanically at the same rate as the story progresses, which how character progression in storytelling is supposed to work.

But let's say you don't care about stories and roleplay and that your group just plays DnD for the sake of having a wargame dungeoncrawler (which is an absolutely fine and valid way to play DnD, despite which a lot of the community tends to say). Milestone leveling is still better, because it still encourages players to interact with the material you have prepped. Let's say you have a campaign where there are six MacGuffins at the bottom of six different dungeons and the players have to go to each dungeon and get each item, Legend of Zelda style. Perfect: players level up at the end of each dungeon. Now players are excited to complete each dungeon, because they don't just get items; they're guaranteed a level for each section of the game they complete.

What do you guys think? Has anyone ever tried both systems and still prefers EXP?

tl;dr: Milestone leveling is easier and directly ties mechanical progression with character/story progression.",35,1585087889,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foed69/why_i_prefer_milestone_leveling_rantessay/,DnD,1

foe2x0,Sefphar,The Enelysion (my first homebrew magic item),"The Enelysion is an enchanted longbow that requires attunement made from layers of blue dragon horn and scales and bronze dragon scales.  It was constructed by a wizard at the request of its namesake, a wood elf ranger but the wizard died before finishing it.  When found it holds 3 charges and recovers 1d2+1 charges each day.  1 charge can be used to cast Lightning Arrow at base level.  Three charges can be used to cast Lightning Bolt at base level.  The bow is flawed however.  Use of the Lightning Bolt power subjects the user to half damage, 1/4 on a successful Con Save.  The flaw stems from the wizard not considering the drawing of the bow as part of its magic.  

The bow can be perfected by undertaking a series of quests to find materials to make a suitable bowstring for it.  When I gave it out for example the quests to complete it were the wielder single handedly defeating a shambling mound and taking its still living root stem to a wizard to prepare.  The next part was to get a bowstring made from three threads woven together, one each of silver, mithral and adamantine, using a technique known to a specific clan of dwarves.  To get the materials they had to save the life of a Mountain Dwarf lord from a Derro assassination squad and they then had to save a Hill Dwarf community from a coven of hags who were sowing intense paranoia and greed amongst them.  Finally, after the bowstring was made and locked into place via pieces made from the root stem a lacquer had to be made from the scales of dragons related to the ones used to make the bow and the root stem pieces lacquered.

The completed Enelysion is a +1 longbow that holds up to 4 charges with the same recharge rate of 1d2+1 per day.  The spells cast with the bow can be upcast by using extra charges and finally the wielder of the bow is resistant to lightning damage.",0,1585086916,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/foe2x0/the_enelysion_my_first_homebrew_magic_item/,DnD,1

In light of quarantine, I‚Äôve decided to take on a second homebrew campaign through Roll20. We haven‚Äôt begun yet, and character creation was done over Discord. 

One of my players has never played D&amp;D before. As I read aloud his race and class options from the Handbook, he joked that he wanted to be a ‚ÄúThree-Quarterling‚Äù or a half human, half halfling. I‚Äôm also unsure about the mathematical accuracy there, but within moments, Three-Quarterling turned into a thing. He wanted to be one. Another player jumped to his support, and they demanded it through a fit of giggles. It was a funny idea, definitely possible in a fantasy rpg story, and hardly any work was required on my part to hybrid the races. I obliged him with his Three-Quarterling.

We continued with his character creation. As a bard, he went on to insist that his instrument of choice/arcane focus be a levitating GRAND PIANO that follows him around. I was definitely less receptive of this one than with Three-Quarterling. Nonetheless, I agreed. I want to welcome this kind of outside-the-box character creation, and it could definitely make for an interesting and unique story elements. We‚Äôve determined his piano has just been newly enchanted to levitate in this way, through means of a powerful wizard who spent a lot of time with it. On to why I‚Äôm writing you all... when it comes to gameplay, how could I implement this into the game? I genuinely want him to have his floating piano, and I see it as an opportunity to do something cool with. What happens with it during combat? Dungeon crawling? Do I just make him leave it everywhere it won‚Äôt fit? Perhaps there‚Äôs a unique game mechanic I can build around his piano. 

I‚Äôm here for ideas and suggestions!

focprv,CursoryMargaster,I Love My Party,"I started running a new campaign recently, and I just had to get it off my chest how great my players are.

They're all playing roleplay-heavy characters (even the new guy who has very little experience with DnD!) which is great for my very story-oriented campaign, and all of them went with classes and races they thought were cool, with little regard to optimization. Before the first session, two of the players came up with combined backstories for their characters who had been childhood friends, even though they didn't know each other outside of the game.

I run a homebrew world, so I have to keep dropping handouts and the like on them to let them be knowledgeable about the world that I made up, and they eat it all up hungry for more, even when it's just tons of maps, bits of history, complicated relationships between major factions, and thematic alterations to the stereo-typical DnD world.

While making their backstories, the players all were asking me tons of questions about the world so they could work their characters into it, as well as taking artistic license to make up aspects of the world that I hadn't considered to make their stories cool.

And just this last session we had last night, I was super anxious about the whole thing, partly because we had to play online due to quarantine, and I had never played a fully online session before, especially not as the DM, and partly because I had done very little prep beforehand because I had no idea what the party would do and didn't have any hooks to throw at them to get them moving. It was definitely a slower session than normal, doubled with the fact that we were still all getting our tech issues worked out. But the players jumped right into it and took initiative about what they wanted to do, and had a ton of fun roleplaying with each other and the NPCs and wrapping up their loose ends before leaving the city they were in.

The garrison is heavily guarded just as the walls are. on an insight check of DC 13 the players will find that the guards know of the previous attack of the shadow army on the City of bruhington that is to the west. If the players were not escorted then they may find a way to sneak in or they may persuade the guard with a roll of DC19 (persuasion) or a DC20 (Intimidation). The general's reaction varies according to how the players got in and I will leave that to the DM to interpret. Either way the general is eager for any information and it is quite easy to get him to trust you with information as long as you mention the shadow armies. The general provides information about the shadow army.(The fact that they can go into shadows and use them to travel and the huge machines they have).¬†

**The Arch-mage¬†tower**

This is where the [Lord ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.dandwiki.com%252fwiki%252f5e_SRD%253aArchmage)of this city resides. he is powerful almost as powerful as the previous Lord of the land. The adventurers can visit the mages tower and ask him questions relating to the Arcana of the shadow army with a roll of DC14 (persuasion).

**The Castle walls**

The castle walls are huge and have¬†[ballistas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.dandwiki.com%252fwiki%252fMedium_Ballista_(5e_Equipment)) üì∑ set on top of them. they are accessible by a set of ladders. upon rolling a DC13(Perception) The players find that there is a way the climb the walls without the use of ladders if someone were Agile (Acrobatics) or Strong (Athletics) enough.

**The players may go to all locations and/or go to taverns or shops along the way but make sure to limit their time as there is a huge army approaching ;)**

The players hear a huge horn in the background. and outside there is a Gargantuan dragon over the hill along with a huge army on the horizon. The players may roll a DC16(Insight)¬† to notice that the dragon is leading them. the players see multiple[ City takers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.dandwiki.com%252fwiki%252fCity_Taker_(5e_Equipment))¬†and[ catapults](https://www.dndbeyond.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fwww.dandwiki.com%252fwiki%252fLight_Catapult_(5e_Equipment)). The dragon Orders the troops to arm the catapults as everyone gets ready. The players roll for DC12(Perception) check. If they succeed then they see that while the catapults launch their rocks; some of the shadow soldiers disappear into the ground and into the catapult's shadow transporting (1d6+1) Shadow soldiers.

¬†If the players stay or go to the castle walls after the attack of the Shadow army then they will be met by a shadow general and any amount of shadow generals that the dm supplies. there will also be knights and the General of the city fighting atop the castle wall too. the players can try and use the ballistas to destroy the city takers no matter how far they are.

focmzk,Auric877,Looking for Creative Ideas for Campaign,"
So my party consists of 8th level characters including:
-An OP Human Paladin, hombrew subclass for Moon goddess from nobility of a mining/slaving family, left it for obvious Lawful Good reasons
-A New ""Human"" Cleric of Bahamut, Protection Domain. (actually a silver dragon trapped in human form due to falling from grace in Bahamuts court, he's questing to prove himself to regain his status)
-A low intelligence Wood Elf Druid, Circle of Land (Coast). Running from criminals who killed his fiance
-A little aasimar girl who's a blood hunter. Order of Ghostslayer. She ran from her angelic aasimar community out of shame after one of her wings got burned (go with it. I know aasimar dont have wings raw)
-A funny Aarakora(spelling?) Monk. Homebrew subclass. Very lightning oriented. Chosen to slay red dragon at young age, but ran out of fear. Worships lightning god. 
-A Tiefling Lore Bard. Tieflings are enslaved by dragon borns after they lost a big war between fiends and dragons in my world and so he saved his town from the dragonborns but got caught and then later escaped and went adventuring.

So they've just got back from dealing with the paladin's family and are on their way to deal with the monks dragon. 

They're kinda just going through backstory quests right now, but I have a big boss, a rakshasa who's posing as a lord. I want him to be the villian part of a murder mystery dinner party. He lost control and slayed a human guest (rakshasa are fiends that eat humans and consume their souls) and so hes trying to get away with that.

So I would kinda just like to see what other ideas people have with this for any part of the campaign. I also would like a sneaky way to get them to that party and not make it obvious it's a murder mystery because then they prepare locate object, speak with dead, etc and that's too easy. 

Thoughts on how to get them to the party? without just a simple ""hey famous adventurers come to my party on a dark and stormy night where no one will die"" invitation. 
One idea was to have this party to be a very exclusive (less NPCs to keep track of) and thus the invitation is part of a reward for a quest completed for the rakshasa/lord as an opportunity to connect with powerful allies. The rakshasa/lord is a merchant who is in charge of a caravan that transports exotic goods all around world. So if that's a good route what would be a good CHALLENGING encounter for the party that would make sense?

Also any ideas for the party itself, clues, guests, red herrings etc? 

And anything else you awesome d&amp;d players and DMs think would be cool to include?

Note: This is 5th Edition with plenty of homebrew. We are huge Critical Role fans, but most of us played before we discovered them. The party is loaded with magic items and very powerful. At only level 6 or 7 they defeated a Dire Troll (CR 13).",2,1585082151,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/focmzk/looking_for_creative_ideas_for_campaign/,DnD,1

fociys,DarthBarneyTheWise,Druid Meat,"I'm a forever DM, which doesn't bother me because I enjoy seeing my friend's creativity play out in a world of my design. A few weeks ago one of my players did something unique that I'd like to share.

My room mate and a dear friend of ours are playing as Krimblepip Farnswallow, a kindhearted Svirfneblin wizard and The Crimson Shadow, a crime fighting Druid Bugbear. They make for an excellent duo. 

After an incident of magic tomfoolery, they found themselves atop a snow covered mountain far from home and are being harrassed by a pack of vicious yetis. They successfully capture one in the hope of learning anything they can before fighting the alpha yeti, King Cold. After forming a line of communication with the yeti with a very convenient yeti lexicon, they found that their prisoner is terrified of their pack leader and refuses to say anything out of fear. With them being good characters, torture was off the table so The Crimson Shadow decided that buttering up the yeti was the best course of action. After giving the Yeti nearly every scrap of rations they had, they finally gave him their last and best bit of food, beef jerky. 

They found that Yetis go bananas over cow meat and would be willing to do next to anything to have more. The problem here is that they just gave him their last piece. With a promise to assist them in convincing his yeti brethren to allow them safe passage in exchange for more cow meat, Shadow did something that I'm not entirely sure is allowed.

 He used his druid ability to transform into a cow and had Krimblepip slice two flank steaks off his living body. 

Krimblepip was horrified and Shadow nearly passed put from the pain but I ultimately allowed it because it was clever and my first rule is the rule of cool. They fed the bugbear cow meat to the yeti and eventually gained a pack of loyal yetis that were reformed into honest cow farmers.

Besides wishing to share this peculiar tale, I also wanted to know if this plan is allowed with the base rules of 5e. I couldn't find anything to goes against it but I'd like a 2nd opinion. Thank you for reading.",2,1585081794,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fociys/druid_meat/,DnD,1

One of my players is uhh... very special compared to the rest with just how much he sticks out and how different his class is. Currently, at level two, the capacity of his abilities are pretty much, using a bonus action he can summon a random item by rolling a 1d100 and landing on a certain tier, and he gets the item. There are more mechanics on how this works, but the reason I don‚Äôt have item charts for the 1d100 is I don‚Äôt want him getting something completely useless, yet super high tier, especially because his character believes everything that comes out of the chest is 100% useful, and it all disintegrates eventually too. There‚Äôs way more to the class then just this, and eventually he gets way cooler stuff, yet it‚Äôs only a lvl 2 party right now.

fobmqx,supersapians,Blessed Warrior Fighting Style for A Paladin,"Currently playing an Oath of Redemption Paladin and I chose it for some utility but mostly flavour. So far, I'm been enjoying it. I'm playing my character as a particularly pious individual and being able to call upon small feats of divine magic at will sets a nice tone. 

I've been told however that it may be a poor choice, given the other fighting styles but given how strong the core mechanics of the Paladin are, a slightly substandard style wouldn't be too much of a detriment? 

Does anyone have any experience with this particular style? How has it been in practice?",5,1585078947,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fobmqx/blessed_warrior_fighting_style_for_a_paladin/,DnD,1

fo9si9,CorellianDawn,DM Question About Spell Line-Of-Sight,"Recently one of my players brought up some spell rules, or at least how he perceives them, and I wanted to check with the general community to see who is right here.

This is in regards specifically to spells that require a target and have a saving throw. Lets use the spell Web as an example.

"" You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range "".

His argument is based on Jeremy Crawford's quote that spells will always specify if they require line of sight and that if it is simply ""a point you can see"", it can be cast ANYWHERE within range, even without line of sight. This could be behind a wall for instance or into total darkness.

My argument is that this is nonsense, how can you possibly target something (the ground or creature) without looking at it. How would you judge the distance? And even if it was allowed, how would I adjust the player's casting roll? As a saving throw, I can't impose disadvantage on his attack roll, I would have to give advantage on the saving throw, but that doesn't make any sense. There's no roll in place to determine if a saving throw based spell goes where you want it to because its assumed you see a target and then the effect appears on them without having to roll dice. Then if its a creature, they can react and whatnot.

The specific instance of this in gameplay was a caster trying to summon Moonbeam behind a wall of fog. There's no roll for placing Moonbeam and its not a projectile the originates from the player, its basically a laser guided artillery strike, so I didn't allow the casting of it through the obscurity and made the caster move for line-of-sight.

Am I missing something here? CAN casters simply hide behind a wall, close their eyes, and have spells accurately appear places?",39,1585073109,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo9si9/dm_question_about_spell_lineofsight/,DnD,1

DnD is all about your OC
How much Gold they can seek
How much damage they can do

Where Aboleths and Liches are your‚Äôs to tame 
You read the stat block and guess my every move
You say the dice is cocked when they do not land smooth

TTRPGS is where you can be
Anything you aim to seek
You want the sword that can cut a thousand hearts
It is shaped like a katana and you can throw it like a dart

fo8rvd,ToasterWaffles17,Story Time,"Recently, I've been doing a lot of D&amp;D through Discord. One of my friends was the DM for a new campaign. In the first session, we arrived at a town called Riverdale (I don't know why he gave it that name). Our paladin had just accidentally cursed the chief of the area under his breath and a member of the royal guard heard. He tied the paladin up with rope. I, being a bard, decided to cast hideous laughter on the guard. While the guard was busy dying from laughter, the spellcaster of the group used shape earth to create a pitfall for the guard to fall into and then used summon water to effectively drown the poor chap. After that, I went to untie the paladin's ropes.

Me: Can I sleight of hand the ropes?

DM: You don't have to...

Me: I don't care, can I?

DM: Fine, I g...

Me: Nat 20.

DM: You untie the ropes so well, that he doesn't even realize that they're untied.

Me: Can I also pickpocket him?

DM: Roll with advantage.

Me: How does a 22 sound?

DM: You take his 20 gold.

Me: Can I stealth back to my original position so no one knows that I did it?

DM: Sure

Me: 17

DM: No one notices anything.

Everyone else there hated the bard, saying that it was a useless class, but I proved them wrong just through that encounter.",0,1585069831,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo8rvd/story_time/,DnD,1
fo8q54,qPolEq,Artisan‚Äôs Blessings and no plate armor discussion.,"I‚Äôve seen many posts on various sights regarding the topic of the Forge Cleric crafting their own plate armor via Artisan‚Äôs Blessings. Many say it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúRAW‚Äù, so therefore it‚Äôs up to the DM, though, it actually is-


Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.
You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or **another metal object.** The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual‚Äôs end, **magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.** The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

The ‚Äúor another metal object‚Äù clearly states that as long as it basically has metal, and it‚Äôs less than 101GP, you can create it. Yes it‚Äôll take you a few days (15 or less), and you‚Äôll have to drop 1,500GP, but you can absolutely create the entire metal pieces that form a complete suit. 

And there‚Äôs an argument that could be had regarding smithing it together, because that last sentence of Artisan‚Äôs Blessings states ‚Äúmagically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation‚Äù meaning all the buckles and clips needed for plate armor to fit together, is already attached to the pieces.",10,1585069682,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo8q54/artisans_blessings_and_no_plate_armor_discussion/,DnD,1

fo8izm,Brom0nk,Illusion Spell Rulings (and general spell casting questions),"Hello everyone. I was curious how you all run illusions in your game since I have a fairly imaginative caster that has left me perplexed a few times as a DM. How do you all rule out the nuances that are related to illusion spells? Illusion is the one school of magic that doesn't have very ""hard"" rules and I've had to make up a few rulings on the fly.

1) Imitating Spells.  
I have a caster that loves to use Major Image to try to imitate spells. You get to manipulate 20ft of space, so doing things like raising skeletons out of the ground to imitate a high level animate dead, or making stone come out of the ground to imitate a wall of stone. For most regular enemies like goblins or bandits, they see it and think the caster is very strong, but would a caster have a chance to notice something is up? I've been playing Pathfinder King Maker recently and when you cast spells of different schools, the caster uses a different phrase. Assuming it has a verbal and somatic component, would you have to say illusion spell related words since you are technically casting an illusion spell? Is magic like harry potter and everyone has to use the same words for spells, or can it be different for each person? Say the words for Major Image were ""Pharah tu soce"", would reciting that immediately tell a caster you're casting an illusion?

2) Cover and Line of sight.  
If you're out in the open and say a mage or ranged combatants were peppering the party, with Major Image you can create a 20 ft square of illusion. If the illusionist uses major image to create a giant wall, enemies can no longer see the party. Since the party knows it's an illusion, can they see through it even though the enemies can't? If they can see, would throwing a fireball or shooting enemies from behind the wall blow the illusion? Can enemies still examine it from 45ft away? Say they shoot at it anyways and the arrow goes through. They would know it's an illusion, but they didn't make the check. Do you have to make the check to be able to see through the illusion, even if you see someone run through it? If someone tells you it's an illusion, does that automatically make others see through it? Even when you can see through it, is it lightly obscured by opacity? 

Just curious on how other DMs handle it or how players wish things were interpreted. I try my hardest to not gimp illusions while also not letting them do everything in the world.

As a part of the adventure/story there is a spy working for the BBG in town keeping an eye on the adventurers. She doesn't actually do anything until she exposes herself by summoning undead to attack the heroes. It seems like a missed opportunity to me, to add some variety to the module which is mostly dungeon crawls. I'd like to add in a session of non-combat detective like work, to discover the identity of the enemy agent.

fo7jp1,VoIkose,Rough Session - Faerie‚Äôs Charms Turned Me Against The Party,"I‚Äôm normally a DM, but have recently had the good fortune of playing as a PC in a biweekly game.

However, last night I had a brutal session.

Our 4th level party is exploring a forested area on the edge of the Feywild.  While taking my watch during a long rest, my character (Battlemaster Fighter) failed a WIS save and got charmed by faerie magic, luring him away from the camp.

Upon realizing I was wandering away, the rest of the party (Druid, Ranger, &amp; Bard) tried to stop me.  At first, the Druid was able to pin me down after becoming a Dire Wolf, and the Bard tied a rope around my ankle.

However, after some (un)lucky rolls, I was able to get away, and I started running towards the faerie lights.  

The party gave chase: the Druid bit at my ankles to trip me; the ranger shot at my feet.

Up until this point, my character was unwilling to use violence.  However, between the power of the charm and my companions attacking me, my character was pushed over the edge, and started fighting back.

I used all my maneuvers and abilities to escape my compatriots, and dealt a fair bit of damage to the Druid in the process.  

However, once I escaped to the faerie lights, it became apparent this was a trap.  I was transported to the custody of an Unseelie lord, who subjected me to unfathomable torture.  

After an evening of such torment, I was returned to the party with 1 HP, one level of exhaustion, and my CON permanently reduced by 1.  

Moreover, because my character had attacked the party, the other characters now distrust him.

The session ended with my battle-hardened fighter‚Äîa veteran of the Queen‚Äôs Companies‚Äîcollapsing onto the ground and sobbing from the ordeal.

**TL;DR** Don‚Äôt use WIS as a dump stat.",6,1585065725,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo7jp1/rough_session_faeries_charms_turned_me_against/,DnD,1

Here's my question regarding specifically the spell Mass Suggestion (lvl 6, PHB 258)

Given the way it is worded, is it both RAW and RAI to phase your suggestion in such a way that those that fail the save continue to obey you for the rest of the duration of the spell?

EG: ""Lay down your weapons and obey my commands. Do this and no harm shall come to you on this day.""  Just a sentence or two, easy to follow, and does not lead to crazy or suicidal behavior.  But is this the equivalent of wishing for more wishes?  

I intend on trying to control and shut down the party rather than killing them, because this big bad has plans that he could use the party for.

I WAS going to use the Lost Mines of Fandelver (is that title right?) that came with the 5e starter pack...but then I got an idea. And like an idiot I ran with it.

So the party met at this HUGE regional bazaar thing held once a year at the biggest trade city. There, they encountered a mysterious shopkeeper. While investigating her, the city is attacked by a white dragon and the woman, an aasimar, flies up to fight it, but not before giving the party a box with something super magical inside.

They flee, along with the rest of the surviving civilians, and take the box to a nearby town situated in an anti-magic field (which I did NOT expect to happen when I made the town, stupid me)

A day later, under a full moon, the box opens and there's a weirdly multicolored dragon egg inside it, which hatches into an opal dragon.

And that's what I got, I don't know where to go from here. I know I want the big climax to happen in the mountains, with multiple dragons, but I don't know how to get from here to there. 

The idea is, I'm always super unhappy with the idea that a creature's species/subspecies/color determines who they are and what they believe. I really don't like the metallic=benevolent chromatic=malevolent (I didn't learn about gem dragons until after I started the game, but it's a little like that). The opal dragon is the result of a metallic and chromatic dragon basically doing an experiment (*heh*) to see if they can create a dragon whose personality is entirely malleable by experience and socialization, in the name of exploring chaos, the idea of having no way to predict an outcome, and of challenging accepted rules. 

But other dragons and agents of order and even some agents of chaos want to stop the experiment and want the baby dragon dead before she can fully realize her identity. 

Here's my big problem: my fire genasi wants to take the baby to the bronze dragon who sort of rules over his volcano home. This is a Bad Idea. My party is level 3.

fo76kc,Monngo_like,My daughter's first time DMing (9 years old),"With social distancing happening, we have been playing Dungeons and Dragons at our house. I have been DMing for my wife and 9 year old daughter, and it has been a blast. Her first character is a Dragonborn barbarian named Zed. Zed became an adventurer when his wife and daughter were killed in a goblin attack on his home. She worked out that back story all on her own. It is very Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy inspired. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. She has caught up on all her online school work, and her screen time is limited. She can ""earn"" more time on the TV or switch (both her and my wife have fallen into the Animal Crossing vortex...) by doing things. And one of the things I suggested was writing her own Dungeons and Dragons story about what happened in her last adventure as Zed. She was not excited about that, and asked about her own game. I gave her some basic info, suggested she limit it to one type of monster with a boss monster at the end. With that she looked through the Monster Manuel and settled on Zombies. Since we have Zombicide the board game, she has plenty of fun minis to use on the play mat. So with this information at her finger tips, she has decided to design her own quest, story, dungeon, and reward for us to run.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so proud of my little fledgling nerd. Dungeons and Dragons was such an impactful part of my childhood and I am just happy to get to share it with her. With society's embrace of nerd culture with the popularity of things such as Critical Role, and celebrities who play Dungeons and Dragons openly, I am just happy she gets to grow up with my hobbies that were often ridiculed or sidelined when I was her age. I remember learning about Vin Diesel playing Dungeons and Dragons when I was a kid, and immediately feeling a sense of belonging, and my daughter will have many more role models in our society to relate to.

I will update with pics as she gives us more information. Here is her working on her DM setup. She already has the dungeon designed (but it is a secret, she will reveal it as we go, like I do). The world map is in progress next.

In my current game their have been two cases. The first was an ireland with a huge volcano on it was home to a black dragon who our party somehow became friends with. After finding him he had gathered an army of kobald to worship him. The party had to gain his trust once again to help us on a task. he asked us to retrieve an accient artifact from within the volcano once belonging to his kin then was stolen by the dragon hunters. In short heading into the volcano the dragon hunters who are undead seemed quite nice people, after telling them we were going to leave they began preparing for the cleansing .

Me and DM decided that since they are so weak even after I named them (race and deities abilities inspired or taken from a book/book series and because of that when I name creatures they get more powerful) I would fight monsters and kill them for the XP,then transfer it to them with one of my abilities until they were a good enough level that I can not worry about them dying because they fell(they‚Äôre a quarter way to level 1,and their stats are getting rerolled and classes chosen today and/or tomorrow)but what domains and subclasses do you guys think I should choose?And what non-sentient or language speaking monsters do you think are good to fight 1v1 or 1v2 and have enough XP for each kill that I won‚Äôt have to fight loads of them and the encounter can be done quickly?

fo72qt,Turtenguin,Help! Im trying to run LMoP but the PC‚Äôs keep murdering people.,"So its my first time DMing and my group have 5 PC‚Äôs, two of which it is their first time playing. I started them out in a tavern where they met up with Gundren and got hired to take his cart the next morning, but instead of camping out or going to the inn they intimidated the tavernkeep into letting them stay in the tavern. When they left in the morning, they burned it down for no reason. I made a big sappy monologue of the barkeep seeing his lifes work ruined, and his son was in the building who they hear burning to death, etc. I hoped that would get them to not do that again and forgave it as it was some of their first time playing. Fast forward, they get to Philandan, and after investigating a bit they arrive at Halia Thorntons doorstep. They did an insight check and realized she had ulterior motives for wanting the local gang leader gone, to which the rogue immediately stabbed and killed her. I made up a scene where they had to run away from the guards, in which they kidnapped Pip the child, and the tiefling bard killed 12 guards instead of taking the clear opportunity I gave her to run away. They basically just said some of them are chaotic neutral and theyre role playing, and that me not wanting them to murder every other npc is railroading them. The person who was really taking the charge knows that its my first time dming and that I chose to follow a book adventure because I cant handle homebrewing at my skill level (which she expressed disappointment to). I honestly dont know what to do now. I know I should have just said no originally, but that was my mistake and I cant really take it back now. I was thinking I could have Sildar (a knighty like npc) and the tavernkeeps kids form a hunting party and go after them and have the redbrands/black spider attempt to recruit them or something? I don‚Äôt really know how to home brew encounters because most of the battles in the book far exceed the xp limitations in the dm guide but they can still beat them? I was considering having them captured by stronger guards, executing them, and forcing them to play good characters, but i mentioned them not being allowed to be chaotic neutral and the leader PC i mentioned earlier got upset. Also, the murdering has been entirely 3 of the PC‚Äôs, and the other 2 have seemed pretty annoyed but not said anything about it. How can I salvage the adventure, allow everyone to have fun, and not railroad the characters?

‚ÄúWar changes people, companions. 3 years ago, it was a grand day. It was the night of the year we paid tribute to our Goddess, Hiatea. My mother and sister had gathered berries as they had always done. My father, my younger brother, and I hunted game, but only took what we needed. We never bothered man, giant nor beast. We took pride in our simple, solitary life. As is the way of my people. We gathered our offering and placed it on the small shrine our mother carried, a shrine she had for as long as I could remember. It was the perfect night: a full harvest moon, thousands of stars, and a small fire that let of dozens of cinders into the sky. We prayed, we ate, and we slept. Fire. Screams. Blood. That‚Äôs what I woke to. The Verbeeg of the Eastern Mountains butchered my family for sport. I rushed out of bed to help, but someone pulled my hand from touching the door. It was a human. A large human, but I could tell he was not of Verbeeg blood. He said ‚ÄòThis feeling you have, the hatred, the anger, the agony. Use it. For I am Hoar, the Doombringer. Rise your fathers hammer in my name. Avenge those whom you held so dear.‚Äô Without hesitation, I reached for his warhammer and stormed the brutes that began celebrating their victory. Now they lie rotting in a place I once called home. We were a small clan, with no name, but we were happy. They stole it, so I will never forgive or trust a Verbeeg or any Giant-kin. They will know the brunt of my hammer and my newfound name. Ereth, Inquisitor of Hoar.‚Äù",7,1585063645,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo6yak/firbolg_paladin_backstory/,DnD,1
fo6xek,JulisRalieghDnD,[5th Edition and Homebrew] Not So Brief Overview Of Campaign One Bloody Destiny - Session 23: 03/18/2020,"After a short period of time passed since the guards ventured into the caves for the disarmed explosives, the men reemerged and confirmed the story Ifneer was giving the royal guard captain. While the captain was still not ready to believe Ifneer, he decided to trust the adventurers given the rescued captives also vouched for them. The royal guard captain asked the group to join him in the barracks to imprison Khiman Rosk where the captain decided to discuss the fate of the slaver with Ifneer. The undead dragonborn took his time to explain the atrocities of Khiman Rosk but clarified that the wolf tabaxi has reconsidered his diabolical scheme and surrendered to receive punishment for his crimes. After hearing out Ifneer, the captain explains that he should go ahead and lynch Khiman now as the wolf man killed the royal guard captain's grandfather after Khiman lost his granddaughter to a suspected serial killer. Thankfully the royal guard captain understands that Ifneer would not be vouching for the slaver if he didn't believe he could change or at least hold up his end of the justice system. The royal guard captain asks Ifneer to take his crew down to the bridge leading towards the capital where he must kill the black dragon preventing market travel in the area. In return, Khiman Rosk will be released into Ifneer's custody where he may be able to assist the adventurers and repay his debt to the party. Ifneer consults his party and they agree to help kill the dragon to help the market of Fayvich and prevent Khiman from being executed. Overjoyed that the party is willing to help the town, the royal guard captain promises to protect the party if people ask around for them and points the party to Aria's Appendix (library) where they can learn more about dragons. Ifneer thanks the captain and sends Zanna to the Hunter's Guild (the real one) while the others investigate the library.

Inside the library, the crew divide up the sources with Aria's help and even find a history book about Ifneer's family alongside the other royal families. Ifneer learns about most known dragons studied around the world while also finding out about a secret project being conducted by his family long before his birth and which ended just after his death. It would seem that certain known figures around the world have been working alongside Ifneer's family on an unknown project with left over funding from the Ravenloft family. While Ifneer investigated his origins and the past governing system of the continent, Mulch and Marybell found a few books that may lead to the identity of the Golden Barracuda seen in Mulch's dreams. After finishing up their research, the group leave the library and find Zanna who has been given numerous special ammo types from the Hunter's Guild in exchange for bringing back the head of the dragon. The group decide to go to the local herbalist where they find a high wood elf who loses his mind when Ifneer enters. After a small discussion, the herbalist points the group towards a bandit camp between Lethbell and Adelora where they can find Maron Blackthorn who specializes in alchemy and black magic (mainly AC lowering abilities which the party wants to help beat the dragon). Before the group leaves, they buy some potions and the wood elf gives the group some hallucinogen berries in return for not being more help to them. The group decide to wrap up the night and return to the Tower of Destiny where Ifneer discusses uniting the guilds under the Narkenspar and Ravenloft family once more to defeat the mysterious Queen of the royal capital. The session ends as Ifneer gets a call from Niaea Hycis who reveals that her boss, Talidil, has gotten word of a potential bomb threat in Fayvich through interrogating Sendel Melrret (through Witcher 3 Necromancy) and that there is a potential traitor in the Hands of The Moon faction. Ifneer informs Niaea that the bombs have been disabled and the Wild Hunt is no longer a threat to Fayvich or anyone else. Niaea praises the group for their hard work and fast actions before calmly asking Ifneer to trust her to find the traitor and that she is going off the grid to ensure the traitor is found is destroyed. Shortly after that call, Talidil calls Ifneer and tells him almost the exact same thing except she does not mention a traitor but instead is concerned that Niaea has disappeared since the interrogation started. Ifneer considers informing Talidil of the conversation he had with Niaea but does not but reassures her that Niaea is most likely trying to help them if she did disappear. The session wraps up with a cliff hanger and the potential introduction of Maron Blackthorn or the immediate assault of the dragon's underwater cave system.",0,1585063552,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo6xek/5th_edition_and_homebrew_not_so_brief_overview_of/,DnD,1

fo6ey9,glory_of_dawn,RPing Insanity/Senility,"Hi all. I'm looking for a spot of advice. Getting ready to start another game with my longtime group, and we're all branching outside of our comfort zones for this one with the characters we're building. 

I initially chose to build a character who was mildly evil (by human morality, anyways, it's not *his* fault his religion said that existence is sin) but mostly just antagonistic, but the GM has politely asked that I not do that because, since he's adjusting the scope of the campaign slightly, an apocalypse cultist would not gel very well with what's going on. That's fine, no objections. 

After considering what else I could do that is outside of my comfort zone, I have decided to play an old man. He's an Aasimar in his eighties, but appears to be a human of similar age since he was born human and got turned into something akin to an Aasimar due to his patron juicing him up with that sweet, sweet death energy. 

Basically, I'm doing the Raven Queen UA patron for mechanics, the fluff of what my patron is is still kind of up in the air. My character is mildly insane due to the events of his past that drive him to his patron. This mostly manifests in two ways: he spends most of his time talking to his birds in clicks and whistles, and I want his speech to reflect his jumbled mental condition.  I'm kind of going for a stereotypical ""old man who speaks in vague riddles and metaphors but completely understands what goes on around him despite the appearance of insanity."" 

Here's specifically what I'm seeking advice on:
‚Ä¢What are some ways I can highlight his insanity without being annoying or obtrusive to the party?
‚Ä¢Can you think of any ways I can try to quickly come up with dialogue that is relevant to the situation at hand, but approaches it in a roundabout or cryptic way? (I know this one is kind of a big ask, but I don't want to do this unless I can commit to it, so I'm trying to figure it out early)
‚Ä¢What other manifestations of senility or insanity can you think of to be put on above and beyond the actual insanity he experiences? He is aware of how he is and leans into it. I'm starting to come up with ideas of how I can do this (One of them is having a designated bird that he addresses for each party member, basically ignoring the physical presence of the other characters and responding to their questions to their designated bird)

I'm usually a pretty solid RPer and don't have these sorts of issues, but since we're specifically outside of our comfort zones...

Reading 5e how does that translate now, I'm reading something about saving throw advantage that sounds less useful, is magic resistance no longer a thing?

Building the encounters is very time consuming and the combat is often so long that the players get bored.) When we talked about flaws, we decided that the flaws should be very real and have an actual effect on the character. We discussed what would connect these characters and found a way to make it happen in game. 

Second, these guys are excellent role players. For the first half hour of session 1, I didn‚Äôt have to say a word. They fully embraced the silliness and it was a blast. 

I love this campaign. 

If you are a PC in a campaign, you will make your DMs life easier by just embracing the story, being silly enough to live in the world the DM has created, and finding a way to make that world your own.",11,1585057918,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo5fxu/appreciating_my_players/,DnD,1

fo5ego,Wheeker,I need some ideas for a campaign,"So as you (probably) all know, there is a quarantine going on and I have been kind of bored. Our school has been shut down, and my group is homeschooled, so I figured I would write a new campaign. I have several ideas but I need some more \*details\*. Here is the basic idea: 

* The group is a band of merchants
* They will have different routes to go on to get supplies for their shops
* they will each find a piece to a larger treasure which will help them unlock something great (I know what it is)
* after they re-unite  they will start their travel of the continent

fo5drn,sleepystarchild,How do I approach my new DM about how our first session went? Am I being unreasonable?,"I believe this type of post is allowed but if not, my apologies; I'm still getting the hang of this Reddit thing.  Also apologies for the length... this is partially a vent post, but also I'm inexperienced enough that I genuinely don't know if I'm in the wrong here for feeling this way, so I'm including lots of detail.

TL;DR: My new group and I feel that our DM, who is a good friend of ours, is being unfair. He doesn't seem to react well to suggestions, comments, or concerns... Is there any way to salvage this seemingly already sinking ship?

A group of my good friends and I decided to get together to play DnD while we're all stuck at home. I offered to DM because I had a little bit of material ready for CoS, and most of the group was down except for one player, who wanted to DM because he ALSO had something prepared... so we decided to let him. And now all of us regret that choice, after leaving our first session feeling frustrated and drained.

During our Game 0, we all created characters. Asked him if there was anything we needed to know about the setting beforehand and he said no, we were solid. Once we started the game however, he set the scene with some information: we were all students at a melee fighting school, and had been for a year. But our party comp is mostly ranged weapons users and spellcasters; I'm the only melee fighter involved. During our ""final exam""--a fight--because it was a melee fighting school, the others were not allowed to use their primary ways of dealing damage... and then he yelled at and insulted them for their low rolls and not being able to hit the enemy.

During this fight, it felt like he constantly imposed other things on us; for example, I was blown backward by a gust of wind into a wall ten feet away when the enemy attacked, and took almost half my health in damage, but I wasn't given the opportunity to make any sort of check or saving throw to prevent this.

After the fight, we were given a ten minute in-game break to do ""whatever we wanted"" (think of it like an elementary school recess before the next class) so the party decided to talk to one another and actually meet one another... but this did not make the DM happy. He wanted us to explore the building we were in, and grew increasingly frustrated with us when we didn't, calling our interactions unneeded and stupid, to the point where he just... stopped allowing us to do things until he dropped the next plot point:

A group of kobolds ambushed the school and he had all of them descend on me at once. There was no surprise round, and all of them rolled different initiatives (visible on Roll20), but he moved them as one and I was immediately bombarded with attacks due to Pact Tactics..?

After we got those dealt with, we were locked in the exam room because of the ambush in order to keep us safe, the doors guarded by two sentries of some sort. No matter what we tried, and we tried A LOT of different things, we couldn't get past them. We weren't allowed to roll for anything, either. It was just a bombardment of ""that doesn't work, that doesn't work, that doesn't work.""

So I, as well as the rest of the group, left our session last night feeling extremely put out, discouraged, and frustrated. Is it like... reasonable for us to feel this way given this information? Are we just bad players? Does anyone have experience with approaching a DM they're having trouble with, especially one who is a good friend and probably won't take your concerns well? What would you do in this situation, just find a new DM? I'm really disappointed because I love these people and we all just wanted to have a good time, ya know?",9,1585057672,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo5drn/how_do_i_approach_my_new_dm_about_how_our_first/,DnD,1

I finally find a dwarf who sells black market items on the down low
5th level necro spell scroll for raise dead 2700 GP.
*enter gambling spree*
*I go broke*
Me: ""I'll be right back"" * walks into the forest and opens my bag of devouring and a dead wyvern is there (dragons and anything dragonlike has a bounty in this world) i walk back in and plop a wyvern head as a bet and wasnt descreet at alllllll.
I win and leave with 4 platinum for the head of the wyvern plus 1 plat from poker and go buy my scroll.
Hes closing up and accepts payment tells me to meet him in the next town in 3 days since its a special order.
*we travel all the way to the nearby town called ashen keep or something alone the lines*
I find him and go inside he locks doors and pulls out this tube and shows me the scroll.
I put the scroll in my bag of holding and notice a letter i didnt have before coming to town, its from this towns arch bishop a meeting and I get 3 PP for going, what could go wrong?
Black market guy also has one and says he doesnt trust it but hes going anyway.
So me and my 2 companions travel to the meeting place the next day and the time thats specified by the arch bishop.
We go in, im uneasy *rolls to talk to gods to see if its a trap NAT 20*
My invitation glows with evil intent I realise everybody in this room has a bounty. I look to my left and see the black market dwarf.
We sign our names to lathander I have to lie because i have the name ysira (I was a dragonborn got turned to ash and rose back as a high elf so my name brings suspicion because of my 75 plat bounty).
We collect our PP all the doors dissapeared and the arch bishop says ""last alive gets all these bounties""
So I use my natural persuasion to talk 2 more people to fight for my group so 7 of us are fighting, only 4 of us left. My poor black market buddy died.
I looted him for any belongings to find out what to do with his ""business"" and my dm said im now the owner of his mobile shop unless i sell it.

I'm the only one with experience in 5e, the DM plays 3.5 and all the other players are still learning how to play. 

The thing that bothers me is that, since I'm the only one who know how to make a character sheet, my characters are generally more powerful than the other player's.

Because of that, my DM keeps nerfing me, from turning bonus actions and reactions into actions, changing how my spells work and just outright disagreeing with my class features, and denying me from using them properly.

I don't wanna be a rules lawyer, but I fell that, if I knew I would get my features nerfed or negated, I wouldn't have takes those, and instead invested in the non negated ones.

This has been bothering me, and I keep feeling like a rules lawyer (and maybe I am), but all I want is to play the character I invested time in creating.

The biggest problem here is that one of his stats he rolled a 17, added +2 cuz teifling and then doubled proficiency in slight of hand because rogue, is it too over powered for this person to have one +8 in sleight of hand a +7 in deception a +6 in acrobatics and stealth

His things are:

 Zephyr is an Air Genasi monk, he has the distinct pale blue skin and white hair of a Genasi. He is also very much built like how you would imagine a martial artist would be with a lighter frame concealing his well toned body. He wears loose flowing blue robes with orange detailing and always seems to be accompanied by a gentle breeze that plays with his hair essentially giving him a permanent Fabio effect.

 He's calm, laid back and always ready with witty remark or pun. While I know how he should act by being a friendly presence in the party that may be too laissez fair sometimes I'm not really sure how he should speak or how far I should go with it. Previously I tried a surfer stereotype when I first started playing him but I think I went too far with it and he didn't really have any motivation to do anything and the act got boring after a while. Then I tried more of a hippy act but I couldn't justify why a peace lover was cracking skulls and snapping spines.

 Overall I want a character type where I can keep things light but also justify why I can stop a guys pulse with my fist and any examples of a tv/movie character who fits this would be appreciated.",3,1585038423,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo1kk5/how_should_i_roleplay_my_character/,DnD,1

Thus far, my big bad has been revealed to be a Lich, with an Ancient Black Dracolich working alongside him. When can my players reasonably expect to encounter this, if they were to fight them at full strength? What about after going through the Lich's tower? How can I make this encounter a crazy finale? I'm not afraid if a player or two dies, but I'd like to avoid a TPK; I want them at a point where they can win this fight, but not make it trivial. I've told them that they're not the center of the universe and giving them access to allies who may be able to help them. So the question is, to all you experienced DMs: How would you handle a Lich and Ancient Black Dracolich big bad, and how strong should the party be before this encounter?

fo0zdf,bitsfps,How to make sense out of AC in 5E ?,"As a DM that likes a more strategic way of approaching situations and specific enemies, i have lots of problems with mechanics that were oversimplified in 5E, and probably the main one is the Armor Class, and the problem is that it doesn't make that much sense to me, and that's because i can't imagine someone's AC being the same agaisn't every type of weapon, creature or magic.   
(just let me know if i'm getting Anything wrong, or don't know some rules)  
Let me just explain some situations that seem nonsensical to me and you might get some idea of what i'm talking about:  


1.    Plate Armor is as good as defending against Slashing dmg, than it is against Piercing or Bludgeoning dmg, but the reason why Piercing was largely used on war was to be better against Heavy Armor, because Slashing couldn't handle it and swords had to be used as spears (using the point) or between armor plates (really more difficult to achieve)  

2.    How Padded Armor (11 AC, meaning Base 10 + 1) can be the difference between taking a hit with max roll on damage and not suffering damage at all.  
Really, what's the thing with blocking 100% of the 20 Damage hit using a bludgeoning weapon just because you had some cloth on you?  

3.    Following up from the previous point, How common it is to roll just enough to hit an enemy, but then deal the max damage possible, or roll a nat 20 and then deal the lowest damage possible (x2), like, there's nothing changing the damage upwards or downwards according to how good you hit the enemy.   

4.    How Dexterity is supposed represent how *Dodgy* someone is against enemy attacks, but it also adds up when they don't even know there's someone attacking them.   
   Like, why does Dex adds up for me to hit an arrow on someone who doesn't even know that i'm there ? (no, i don't count advantage rolls as a bonus, because it can overlap with other bonuses as high ground (dm based) that also give advantage, so it's the same as not attacking from stealth at all, and its still hard AF to hit a high ac target)  

5.    How it is as easy to miss a Touch Attack against someone near you \*(even with advantage)\* as it is to hit an enemy with a long bow in disadvantage. yes, i know the adv/dis helps, but the AC won't change, and with really high ac opponents, it just gets strange to hit the person in front of you by rolling 15 on a 16 AC enemy, specially when the nature of both attacks are so different, one doesn't even need armor penetration, the other one needs to go past it or it's useless.  


I'm sure i can think of much more strange situations, but i'll leave at that for now.   


So, does anyone care about inconsistencies like this? has anyone found a smart way to fix it without making D&amp;D turn into Rolemaster? Is there anything there that it's already fixed but i don't know about?",70,1585034939,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo0zdf/how_to_make_sense_out_of_ac_in_5e/,DnD,1

fo0en3,Kurohimiko,What are your thoughts regarding the Noble Genie Warlock Patron from UA.,"As the title says, how do you feel about it? Does it feel ready to release or does it still need to cook? What would you change regarding it, if anything? How would you go about playing the subclass? Pretty much anything else regarding it.

Personally I thought it was meh after first read, that was until I saw a video by Tulok about using it to make [Yugi Muto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqPW4p7125c&amp;t=) after which I went back and gave it another look over and started to see possibilities.

As it stands I love the subclass flavor wise and mostly like it feature wise. My only gripes are as follows:

The Collector's Vessel tether. I dislike it being a 1-Hour connection with limited uses. At max you only get 5-hours of use from it before needing a long rest. Considering this is both the main and first feature it feels kinda poor. Personally I'd remove the limited uses and add more ways to interrupt it.

The level 14 feature doesn't really fit the theme, in my eyes, and doesn't really seem like it should be that high of a level. All you get is either:

1. A healing ability at 8d6 with remove of 1 disease or condition.
2. Giving 1 creature disadvantage for a turn.
3. Casting Legend Lore for free.

You get to do 1 of these per long rest with each additional use before said long rest costing a nonmagical treasure worth at least 500 gp.

From my own reading I would have to agree with those online that it doesn't look like it was designed to be an Elemental Genie patron like it says but more of a neutral Genie more akin to a wish granting one from Aladdin. The only actual ties it has to Elemental Genies are: 1 spell (Fog Cloud), 1 feature (Elemental Resistance), and 2 pieces of flavor (Your tether appearance and the appearance of physical objects from your Pact.)

Based on the description it comes off as a Genie looking to expand it's treasury and you got hired to scour the world for these treasures. Having your final feature be your patron giving you a magical item from it's personal collection as a reward would fit thematically as well as giving a touch of personalization.

Any thoughts on these change ideas? Or of the subclass in general would be most welcome.",3,1585031702,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fo0en3/what_are_your_thoughts_regarding_the_noble_genie/,DnD,1

fo04mn,Magikarpix,What Setting Should My Next Campaign Be?,"Im trying to decide between a few ideas for my next campaign, all 4 of which are based on or based in pre existing worlds.

My 4 Ideas:
-An Adventure Time based campaign
-A campaign based in the world of Full Metal Alchemist
-A Biopunk themed campaign
-Lastly, a space campaign

The biopunk campaign would be based in something like Bioshock (a prime example of Biopunk) or at least use key aspects from that game to shape the world or location.

The space setting would use terminology from a show called Final Space (which i recommend you watch if you havent). Stuff like ""Light Folding"" would replace common ""hyper drive"" lingo. I might use some story aspects from the show, but it wouldnt be the main plot.

Having a campaign take place in FMA woyld be awesome, the party could be a wide range of characters from a military officer who uses a gun, to a character similar to the elric brothers. Fun possibilities to be had here.

And, the Adventure Time campaign sounds dope, as Adventure Time is my all time favourite show. I have an idea already for what i would do if i ran this setting, but i still cant decide.

Please people of the internet, guide me to my next campaign, if you have ideas for certain ones, that would also be appreciated, but voting for what you peraonally would prefer and maybe a reason why would be lovely.

I'm thinking of increasing the number but the goblins party already have 7 of them, including 1 hobgoblin and I think that a street bandit party that have too many people would be weird, and probably would be boring for the players too.

fo00cn,Random_guy_9888,How do I let the fighter shine?,"One of my players is a fighter. The others are a druid, rogue, and sorcerer. He's a tank, and he has actually saved other players lives, but with more subtle, less cool things. Like as soon as a mummy appeared within 5 feet of one of the Squishies, he threw her back 10 feet and took her spot. He didn't do it as a reaction to any attack or anything, just as a preventative measure. There was nothing spectacularly cool about the move and it didn't pay off immediately, but it still saved the character's life and he still doesn't get the cool moments like everyone else does. 

Every time I introduce a tough melee enemy, he's met with CC from the druid and just massive damage from the rogue. I send a few hits the tanks way to let him tank, but eventually I can't possibly reason that anyone views him as a threat. The rogue who just did 30 damage is clearly higher priority than the fighter who did 7. 

How do I let him shine? I'm planning to have someone, maybe the boss for the next session/bbeg of the introductory 5 session goblin story, challenge him to a duel. But I wanna make sure he (and everyone) gets at least one cool moment each session, and I can't do a duel every time.

Recently, I've found myself in a situation where I could be playing in a campaign with a level 40 cap. 

For a while, I've had a backstory in mind for a drow half-elf, and now I want to do the said story as a blaster of all types. The short version is that this guy used to be a slave, working tirelessly under the control of his queen while he was locked in chains with his brothers. Eventually, he got his hands on a magic book that gave him the powers of a warlock. After escaping with his life, he swore that he would destroy the matriarchy that Drows propagate so he may one day free his brother's in chains. Since then, he's been amassing a decent amount of gold by doing good ol' bounty hunting and cheating rich folk out of their gold by using a combo of spells (like friends, and prestidigitation).

I know that I definitely want to start off as a Fiendish Tome Warlock, but the problem is that I don't know where to go from there. I know that the level 20 ability sucks for Warlocks, so I'm trying to find the best route to get this level 40 character who has a Tome, to kick all kinds of ass far from far distances. These are the main things I'm working with.

   * Drow Half-Elf
   * Fiend Warlock

fnz2t9,Infamous_sniper21,How to get in the villain's monologue without the PCs trying to shoot them (or polymorph them and then power word kill them),"tl;dr: No matter who acts first, everyone rolls initiative and takes turns in initiative order once someone  takes an action which would help in a fight, if all sides are aware of each other. The players don't get a cheap shot in if they interrupt the monologue, the villain doesn't get a cheap shot in if they finish their monologue.  


Most DMs have likely had to deal with players attacking as soon as they see the villain and preventing an important character moment with the villain. Why wouldn't they? As a player, you're seeking whatever advantage you could possible get. Not letting the DM get to the end of the villain's speech and attacking first will guarantee you get the first hit in. 

This is an annoying situation for both parties. The DM doesn't get to have the villain say some important lines or have an interesting interaction with the players. The players are taking an antagonistic stance towards the DM and are missing out on some important dialogue. 

How can a DM fix this issue? I see many DMs give their villain some kind of plot armor or crazy protective spell combination. I find this to be dissatisfactory as it brings in questions on why the villain used the protection just to monologue and not for an actual fight. Additionally, it further feeds into the arms race of the players finding ways to defeat the DM in a way they don't expect and the DM trying to get the story to work the way they want. The game becomes more antagonistic.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my proposed solution: If all sides of a conflict are aware of each other, once someone attempts to act in combat, initiative is rolled for everyone and they all take turns in initiative order. No advantages for anyone, not even the villain. Make this expectation known to the players that the villain can't get a surprise round if the player characters are aware of him and that the players can't get any advantage from interrupting the villain.

The reason I think this makes sense is the surprise rules in 5e. According to the combat surprise rules on page 189 of the PHB, if both sides are aware of each other or not trying to hide, they both notice each other and there are no surprise rounds. In the context of the villain monologueing, both sides can see each other and are ready to fight. If a spellcaster starts casting a spell, an archer aims an arrow, or a fighter charges forward, everyone is going to react. Just because one person acted first, doesn't mean they're the fastest. The rogue player may have initiated the fight by having their character loose an arrow, but the villain could've predicted their action and started acting first.

This solution requires that everyone agree to it. The players can be okay with it because, despite not being able to get the first shot in, they know the DM won't be able to pull off a cheap shot on them. 

It is possible that the villain could have hidden henchmen, but because the PCs are aware of a hostile creature(s), so they can't be surprised. Instead, those hidden henchmen will be unseen attackers until they attack, cast a spell, etc.

I like this solution as it makes transitions into a fight much cleaner and easier. What do you think? Do you know of any technicalities that should be addressed? Is there any issues with this system you could foresee?",15,1585024918,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnz2t9/how_to_get_in_the_villains_monologue_without_the/,DnD,1

fnyhwl,driftingjoanna,First time DM for players with much more experience,"I put out a call among friends to see if anyone would be interested and got a good number of replies. But no one wants to DM, which leaves it to me. I've only played in one campaign, so I'm still fairly new to everything. So I've spent the past few days watching every video I can, brushing up on general rules, and building a story line. It's overwhelming honestly, and I'd rather just go lax on rules. I trust the players I've chosen to know what they're doing enough that I'm not doing everything for them, and at least a couple would be totally okay with helping when I'm not sure about something. I just hate the idea of DMing for people with so much more experience than me and coming off as completely clueless and unprepared.

I still really want to give this a go, but I keep putting off preparations because I'm so focused to learning everything I can. I have a story line ready, a list of NPC's started, and a sketch of a map. I'll probably send it off to the party tomorrow so they can start character sheets. Some of them I played with in my first and only campaign, one of them being the DM for it, so I sort of know what to expect from them. I know we all really prefer the role playing and narrative aspects. 

I just don't want the discord to be full of everyone correcting me on things when all I want is to help guide along a story.

The DM has approved this. The whole thing is meant to be framed as a devil's contract because I'm a Tiefling. (Also the goat mentioned is just a re-flavored mule to add more devil theming.)

Most of it is fluff but it's meant to say...........

1) Help with party upkeep costs (In this case the cart and animal)
2) No PVP
3) No lone wolfing 
4) If you die your characters personal belongings will go to your replacement character
5) You can quit the contract at any time

And most importantly our party does not have a Planar Binder and never will so all consequences are non-enforceable. 

&gt;For access to transportation and storage I hereby promise to contribute to upkeep costs of Bard's goat Aleister and cart and offer protection to keep them and the hell-pun wagon safe. 

&gt;I will not.......
* Fight other people bound by this contract.
* Run off on lone wolf quests of vainglory. 
* Have sex in Bard's cart or with her goat Aleister. 
* Participate in demon summoning rituals (Unless demon is to act as arbiter of said contract)
* Engage in filthy habits such as Sharing toothbrushes, sacrificial blood orgies, coughing without covering your mouth, etc.
* Touch other people's belongings without their permission
* Respect the Sabbath 

&gt;Any personal disputes may be handled democratically within the group with Bard having the tie breaking vote.

&gt;In case of destruction of cart and/or Aleister's death there will be a discussion on replacing them at the earliest convenience. The contract will still be in effect until a decision is made. If no the contract is null and void.

&gt;In case of death to anyone bound by this contract your belongings will be used as a bribe to replace you. 

&gt;Breaking the rules of this contract you will forfeit your immortal soul where upon eventual death you will be forced to forever walk the material plane never to know rest. (To be enforced by the parties Planar Binder at their earliest convenience.)

&gt;Person's wanting to end their participation in said contract must give notice, at which point their belongings will be removed from the cart at the earliest convenience.

However, we could create a thread here with many Countries, kingdoms, and their inner workings, it would give a massive list for lazy DM's (like me (: ) to borrow from. 

Lets help everyone speed up their world-building!

Things to include (For those who may not think of everything):

* Economic status: Strong/weak economy, (or more depth different economic statuses within the country or kingdom)
* Religion: Mono-theistic, worshiping all the gods, or Atheistic (also how much influence the religion has on government, as well as government influence on religion)
* Type of government: Monarchy, Republic, Oligarchy, Democracy, or some unique government structure (this could also include different roles in the government)
* Size: Is this a city? Just a state? A full Country? Is it Alexander the great's dream? (Are they trying to expand further than they should be? How does this make other countries feel?)
* International relations: Do they cooperate with other nations when they need to? Or do they seek every opportunity to undercut other nations to take them over? Do they manipulate or cooperate? (Do they have a criteria for who they do which with? This is essentially the area's alignment)
* Military Strength: Do they get pushed over by other nations? Or do they push around? Do they stockpile their arms and soldiers? (Do they make allies with other nations? Do these allies defend them or do they defend their allies?)
* General Racial Makeup: Is this area made of purely humans, dwarves, and elves? Or do they have a lot of diversity? (Do these races have their own castes within society? Do certain races include/exclude other races?)
* Organizations: Churches, Guilds, Trading caravans, Anything other organizations? Do these guilds influence or lobby the government? Are they controlled or established by the government? (Do they compete with each other? Is there a guild that all the other guilds want to remove?)
* Imports/Exports: Is this area known for it's rainbow mead, which gets even an alcoholic wasted? Or are they known for being a port city with lots of trade in and out? (Are these imports/exports legal?)

Feel free go into as little or as much detail as you want in the comments, don't be afraid by the excessive criteria. Also if you see an idea that you like, add onto it!

fnwy5i,xfatalcurex,Trying to make an easy cheat sheet for new players.,"I Started dming a group of brand new players and i feel they are struggling to understand some of the more, no so obvious things about the game, so I made a google doc on some things to consider. Could I possibly get some Constructed criticism on it? ( Sorry don't know how to attach files so it'll just be everything posted below)

  

  

Cheat Sheet for Players

Skills

**Acrobatics**\- Used when trying to doing anything involving running or jumping, can be used to break grapple checks

**Athletics**\- Used when trying to do anything physically draining, such as carrying something heavy or breaking down doors, can be used to break out of grapple checks.

**Insight**\- Trying to see if someone is being truthful about what they are saying (lying or not)

**Investigation**\- Looking for something specific or checking a specific area for something. 

**Medicine**\- First aid

**Nature**\- Knowledge about anything in nature, such as animals, plants and even magic.

**Perception**\- Checking your surroundings. Anything you can see that catches your eye.

**Performance**\- Playing an instrument or doing a dance. Anything that would need practice doing.

**Sleight of Hand**\- Doing things with your hands in a way that makes it so people can't see you doing it. 

**Survival**\- Camping stuff. Anything that will help you survive in the wild.

Combat 

You get to do an **Action** and a **Movement** (If a **Bonus Action** is available to you, you can also take 1 of those as well).

**Actions**\- Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use and object.

**Dash**\- Taking another movement action.

**Help**\- Helping another person complete a task or attack. If you use a help action to assist in an attack, if that player goes before your next turn, they will have advantage on their 1st attack they make. If they help with a skill check, they gain advantage on the skill check. 

**Ready**\- You can prepare yourself to do something i.e. ‚ÄúIf the enemy steps on the trap door, i will pull the lever that opens it.‚Äù

**Grappling**\- Grapples are considered an attack. If you wish to Grapple someone you roll an **Athletics** check against them. To break a grapple on you, you can roll either **Athletics** or **Acrobatics**. 

**Armor Class** or **AC** is how it is for someone to hit you. If you attack something with an **AC** of 15, you need to have a total of a 15 on your attack roll (1D20 + Attack modifier) to hit the target and do damage to it. 

Things to keep in mind

If you think someone is lying to you, remember that you can **Insight** check them to see if they are being shady.

**Perception** checks are used to get a broad view of a room, if you want to find something specific, you have to go **Investigate** and see if anything is there.

If you think you've gotten in over your head, it is ok to run away and reevaluate the situation. Maybe take a short rest and heal up or go to a shop and buy some adventuring gear first.

fnwv5n,andKento,I'm making a sort of Tom Bombadill bandit lord character and want input on race and class.,"So we are a friendgroup who are running a campaing in a made up universe, and when we cant play the main campaign for various reasons we play oneshots in the same universe. Whenever i run a oneshot i have them preform tasks for a Banditt gang. This makes it so we get some evil campaigns. I really love it. 

Now the DM of the main campaign wants me to write up some lore about the bandit gang, and i'm really enjoying the process. I'm imagining the leader of this gang as some kind of mythical creature, that has always been there. His motivations are unknown, he used to be an elf, but he isn't one anymore. He's not a god, but when it happens that someone prays to him, he hears it. I imagine this character as centuries old. 

I haven't quite decided on this characters motivations for doing what he does, but i want to leave it open for the DM of the main campaign to include him if he wants. 

While the lore can be non spesific, i think i need to have an actual race and class for this character in case the DM of the main campaign actually wants to use him, so i thought i'd ask you guys on opinions. Our campaign isn't that strict when it comes to the DND universe, so i'm open to whatever. We do play 5e.
I am thinking of making him some sort of ancient level 20 warlock, but what kind of creature he has turned into i'm lost on.",6,1585015483,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnwv5n/im_making_a_sort_of_tom_bombadill_bandit_lord/,DnD,1

fnwr0c,Frostnight910,Are Dragons compelled to follow Tiamat/Bahamut?,"So, I'm a DM, and I know that ultimately i can handwave most, if not, anything. that said ,I like t keep some level of familiarity when I use known entities.   


Campaign I'm running has the evil gods invading heaven to access their passageway to the material plane. As such the gods in heaven have shut the gate and thus all connection to their followers. the party has learned that this all happened because the Giants/Allfather found a way to trap Tiamat in a pocket dimension, thus suggesting a way for the heavenly gods to remove them one by one and they had to make a move quickly.   


My party's loudest character is a Dragonborn Paladin of Bahamut, and recently I had the party encounter the last Dragonborn to be named Tiamat's champion. Said dragonborn is a Barbarian who is trying to ensure that the chromatic dragons are not hunted to extinction now that they are down a goddess to help them. As such, during this rampant demon invasion going on as the gods fight, the chromatic dragons have assigned themselves protectors of the northern mountains, and roast any fiends they find on sight. Now, there have been some less-than-good things they've done. The secondary goal they seem to have is the eradication of all giants on the mountain, as the giants seem to have the same goal toward the dragons.   


Due to the gifts from Tiamat, including a battleaxe made from one of Bahamuts scales (found in Tiamat's teeth after a battle eons ago) the Dragonborn barbarian (I simply refer to her as The Broodmother) commands the chromatic dragons in their efforts. I'm trying to play her mindset up as still seeing herself as loyal to Tiamat, in that she is protecting the chromatic dragons, but does not necessarily want to see the goddess returned.   


Hence my curiousity, when Tiamat tells an Ancient red Dragon to do something, is it capable of saying no? regardless of the consequences, can it deny her, or are they forced to comply? Are they evil because she's evil, or because they choose to be?",4,1585015018,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnwr0c/are_dragons_compelled_to_follow_tiamatbahamut/,DnD,1

fnwmni,TabletopAdventures,Three More Tavern Games: Fun dice games with simple rules,"**Intro:**

* I recently posted 3 card games that I turned into dice games available for you to play at your games. With the recent shutdowns and many people being stuck at home I thought I would post a few more games. However these are actually dice games commonly played around the world. Let me know what games you play around your table, and if you try any of these let me know how they went. I am working to create more games for you, and bring more rules to you and your table especially now.

**Liar's Dice:**

* Flavor: Four men, each scarred in the face with large axes and swords at their hips sit silently at a table staring daggers at each other. Suddenly one pipes up, ""Five 6's"" and the table goes silent. Then the dwarf bursts out laughing and says ""Bull Shite!"" all 4 men reveal the dice hidden under their cup, the dwarf on his last. The man who was called out counts the face up 6's on the table and shouts ""Four... GODS DAMNNIT!"" as he chucks his second to last dice across the room.
* Rules: Each player must ante into the pot (at my table that's usually 5GP) then every player grabs 4-6 d6 (we usually do 4, basically the more dice the longer the game). We also choose a number to be wild, meaning anytime that number shows, it can be any OTHER number, although many times we let a dice decide this number for that particular game. Play begins with each player rolling all of their dice secretly. Decide who goes first and begin your guesses. Each player, in turn, must say how many of what number they think are face up among ALL the dice on the table. If I have three 6's and one 4 face up I would probably start my bet with four 6's. Therefore I'm saying that on the table, including my dice and everyone else's there are at least FOUR 6's. Play continues until someone calls someone else a liar, at which point you determine what is true, and whoever lost, the caller or the player called, must lose one dice. The game ends when only one person left has dice.

**Pig:**

* Flavor: There are many dice games played in many taverns around the world, but few incite so much anger in a single person as ""Pig."" It has many variants, but most commonly it is once dice and the luck of Tymora. Many prayers have been sent and many prayers have gone unanswered at the roll of a dice in a game of Pig. But in the end, someone always wins, and someone always squeals.
* Rules: The ante in Pig is usually larger than other games as it is very high risk/high reward game. Many times the bar may even add in free drink vouchers to the pot, or other treasures to entice customers to play and buy more as they do. The game is usually played between two players, but games have been known to include 3 or 4, but many times those are instead played bracket style. Each player rolls one d6 to decide who goes first. On each players turn they roll that same d6 as many times as they wish, adding each result to their turn total, but if a ""1"" is a rolled they bust for the turn and forfeit all points. At any point AFTER a roll a player may decide to ""hold."" They then lock in their score for that round and add it to their total over all the rounds. The first player to 100 points, in this way, wins the pot.

**Shut the Box:**

* Flavor: Many tavern goers do not find much joy in mindless bar games decided by a flip of a card, they wish for something more strategic, but still as quick as most games played at the bar. This is where Shut-the-Box comes in. Many tavern owners have a box on hand for those very diners. Despite this being a dice game, winners will not tell you that luck was on their side, no no. They will tout their strategic prowess and mathematical skill over their opponent, surely it was the size of their brain that allowed them to win.
* Rules: This game is best played between 2, 3 or 4 players, and usually has a box with hinged tiles for numbers, but this addition is not necessary to play the game. With this game, antes are usually lower as games only last one round. Play begins with however wanted to play first, and is passed to the left each game after, if the players wish to keep playing. If the numbers 7, 8 and 9 are covered at any point in the game then the player rolls one d6, otherwise play begins with 2d6. Each turn the player must roll the dice (according to the previous rule) until they cannot continue. Each time the dice are rolled add them up, and then cover up numbers whose total add up to the total rolled. (Ex: Roll = 7 Choices = 7, 6&amp;1, 5&amp;2, 4&amp;3, 4&amp;2&amp;1). Once you choose a number it CANNOT be used again, and once you cannot choose any more numbers your turn ends (this means if I roll a 5, and all numbers besides 6 &amp; 2 are covered my turn is over). You then add up the total of the uncovered numbers, this is your score for the game. If a player manages to ""shut the box"", or use every single number 1-9 in one round, they win outright and take double the money from everyone, otherwise the player with the lowest score after 1 turn wins.

fnw4bk,BloomingBrains,Can anyone recommend me a good platform to use for grids in online play?,"I already know there are well-liked platforms for D&amp;D online (Roll D20, Fantasy Grounds, etc), so I apologize if this question comes off as a bit pedantic. 

The reason I'm asking for a recommendation though, is that due to the recent craziness with the COVID pandemic, my group that normally meets up for face-to-face D&amp;D has been forced into online sessions. We already did one session through discord ""theatre of the mind"" style, and it worked well, but was still less than ideal. My players have managed to snag some followers and supporting NPCs as part of an expedition they're on, and some kind of grid will likely be required to keep track of all the complicated positioning of mass combat going on. 

So, what I'm looking for is a cheap and easy way to develop my own custom maps that we could use tokens to move around on for purposes of keeping track. I don't need an online tool to manage all the die rolls, rules, character sheets, etc. Honestly, all of that sounds overwhelming and not worth the effort of switching over to when we're used to managing everything on paper ourselves and are only doing this as a replacement for physical tabletop gaming. All of us already have all the books at home and trust each other not to fudge rolls or cheat in some other way.

Does a streamlined service like this even exist? What are my options, or do I have to move my entire campaign to a fully virtualized service?

Arya, specifically during study of House of Black and White, or maybe immediately after leaving when she's returning to continue her revenge quest.

Elsa from Frozen. Sorcerer seems like a fit since it's magic from birth, but not sure if there's a way to eventually tailor magics to everything ice related.

fnv8g5,Lance4494,"Build, loot, convert. Apocalypse style.","So i had an idea for a series of games, in 5e of course but with tweaks.

Standard stuff first
     -the players find and build a base in the middle of a city (little rock, ar). Base can be in a store or house etc, and use the rss found there (i would use home depot)
     -instead of the standard dnd zombie these will have 5hp/11ac to start, but with a necrotizing bite that when you take 3/4hp the infection becomes more than the body can handle. Fail 3 con saves and you turn, save 2 and your immune for 1 hour, save 3 and your immune for a day.
     -players recruit survivors and loot for supplies.

Not so standard stuff.
     -players will use this website (http://www.kevinhaw.com/add_quiz.php) to generate stats from themselves, basically a would you survive kinda thing.
     -in order to recruit survivors the players need to convince their friends to take the quiz send me their stats, with player name, character name, and class. This serves 2 purposes, gets people interested in the game (hopefully) and gives backup characters in the instance the players bite the dust. Ill also allow them to use my stats, decent con/int/wis/str. Abysmal dex/cha.

And way off the radar.
     -an infection system that provides bonuses based on challenges. If your ever read moshi fanren, the inspiration comes from that. There will be a total of ten stages with challenges for each, providing benefits each stage. First challenge is to survive an infection from bites with at least 2 saves, this provides +2 to con and grants them the ability to sense the infection in themselves. Im currently working on stage 6, they get harder. The players arent going to know about this system until they stumble upon it. The reward for the final stage will be a +4 to all stats and resistance to physical damage.

fnv3qf,Chared945,Using the Thief Rogue Archetype to Level 13 what's a good build for wizard getting his powers back?,"I love the idea of Use of Magic Device working for a class that's normally none magical to enter that area.

The idea for the character is that during their apprenticeship several other apprentices at the academy conducted a ritual which took the ability to cast spells from our character.

So they get kicked out due to the inability to spell cast and have spent the rest of their years preparing a vengeance scheme to get their magic back from the wizards that took it from them.

I think multiclassing into wizard makes use of magic device redundant so that's off.

The thing is while I know Arcane Trickster is an option it's too early a time to suddenly get the spell power back at level three.

The build around this character is meant to be a high intelligence rogue with expertise in arcane and the ritual caster feat. So they know all the theoretical and can do rituals that don't require innate spellcraft but they themselves can't cast.

fnuxgb,RisenGaia,Version 1.2 of homebrew race Living Clothing,"Living Clothing
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution is increased by 1. When Living Clothing has no vessel, it has a Str, Dex, and Con of 1.

Age. Living Clothing can live so long as the fibers of the cloth they inhabit. It is not unheard of for some to live on for centuries and no true lifespan is known.

Alignment. Alignments among Living Clothing can range from good to evil depending on their past life, but most of them spend the early parts of their new lives in seclusion that tends to push them towards the chaotic. 

Size. Tiny

Speed. 5 feet; 30 glide (when bonded to a vessel, speed becomes 25 or 30 depending on if the vessel is small or medium respectively). At level 5, Living Clothing gains the ability to teleport up to 10 feet once a day. 

Sense. Living clothing see‚Äôs normally as if it has eyes. When bonded with a suitable vessel, it uses the eyes of the vessel.

One Size Fits All. If Living Clothing is placed or makes its way onto a small or medium, inanimate object with a humanoid shape, after one hour it can bond to the object and make it its vessel. When bonded, the Living Clothing puts all but 1 of its HP into the vessel. If the HP in the vessel is reduced to 0, then the vessel is destroyed, but if the damage is not enough to carry over to the Living Clothing itself then it falls to the floor in the remains of its vessel. The Living Clothing can also use a bonus action to reclaim any HP the vessel has remaining. 

Spruced Up. At level 7th, Living Clothing gains the ability to take control of a sentient humanoid of small or medium stature. To do this, the Living Clothing must abandon its current vessel and be able to move onto the target. The target creature must then make a Wisdom save throw. Charisma is your spell save modifier for this ability. If the creature fails its save, then it loses control of its body and becomes a vessel to the Living Clothing for up to 8 hours. A creature with an Intelligence of 15 or higher can repeat this save at the end of each hour. 
A sentient vessel starts with its own HP, but the Living Clothing can still empower the vessel with its own HP if it wishes.
The creature and the Living Clothing can communicate telepathically. If the Living Clothing wishes to silence the vessel then it can force it to make a Charisma save, and on a fail the vessel is silenced. A creature with a Charisma of 16 or higher can repeat this save after each hour.",3,1585007972,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnuxgb/version_12_of_homebrew_race_living_clothing/,DnD,1

fnuw6h,ProbablyNotBobSaget,Switching the economy on an island 5e,"Hi folks! Reaching out to see what y'all would do in a situation like this, I have my ideas but I figured the more the merrier.

My campaign is currently on an island where all of the villages (roughly 10 of them each with 80-150 people) are stuck in the bronze age. Meaning copper pieces are like gold pieces, and gold pieces are like copper pieces. This is due to a tyrannical Yuan-Ti civilization in the middle that kidnaps/kills anyone that learns how to smelt iron etc. and hordes all the gold. 

My character recently shacked up in a nice cave that happens to have iron ore veins everywhere, and a miner found out and his clan moved into my cave to begin the excavation process. This means the Yuan-Ti will soon find out and wage war. My plan is to unite the villages and equip them with iron and destroy this tyrannical species. If everything goes as planned, do you think flipping the economy to a more normal one (IE: GP &amp; PP is more valuable) will be relatively easy? I plan on building a keep over this cave in the future and using the cave as a temple for my warlocks diety. Any suggestions on the unification of villages and dealing with the aftermath will be greatly appreciated!

TL;DR- My PC is trapped on an island after a shipwreck. Anyone that manages to leave is hunted down by an evil civilization in control of the island. Economy is backwards. PC finds neat cave with tons of iron ore. What do?",4,1585007844,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnuw6h/switching_the_economy_on_an_island_5e/,DnD,1

The problem is, due to COVID-19, my country has pretty much closed down everything non-essential, and there is talk about us going into full lockdown soon. As such, I can still keep running the campaign for those people who are here. However, I don't want to leave our friend out just because we are in lockdown. So I want to look into a viable option through which he (and anyone else who wants to) can join online, while the rest of us play in person.

fnsqaq,Apprentice_of_Lain,"[help] Disconnected from the character, too much at stake to roll up a new one.","Problem: feeling disconnected from the character I made for the campaign, but I feel he is way too integral to the team to leave (he is the only one with the revives).   
   
Just to be clear: this is my first full-fledged DnD campaign. Before that, all I played was vaugely sci-fi homebrew, based off of 3.5   
   
So, the group I'm in is playing the official SKT module, the whole thing, I'd say we're currently around the midway point or smth.   
   
Back when I joined the party, it had two rogues and a barbarian (lvl 3 back then). I asked the DM about who the party needed, and he said they need a healer, since they're dying too damn fast.   
    
I originally expected the campaign to be serious, so I created a half-serious Dwarven Life Cleric (ex-vet and field medic from a town far east that was ravaged by plague) that was basically ""stealing"" divine power from the gods to heal people (and uses a silver-painted enema with wings as a Holy Symbol). He joined the adventurers because he heard they often find *loads of money*, and he wants to save up enough to open his own clinic somewhere.   
   
At first I had a blast roleplaying: it was a balanced mix of genuine involvement, trying to figure out combat, grumpyness because these idiots just keep getting into harm's way, etc.   
   
As time went on, more people joined, some people left, and some of the old ones made new chars. So, at this point my Cleric is a lvl 9 mult (8 cleric, 1 fighter), and the rest of the party consists of:   
   
- a lvl 10 human Fighter;   
   
- a lvl 6 aasimar Paladin (recently joined);   
   
- a lvl 6 halfling Monk (recently made, previously a Sorc and a Bard);   
    
- a lvl 6 tiefling Bard (previously a Rogue);   
    
- a lvl 6 Sorcerer...I think (I think it's a Sorc/cleric mult, previously the Barbarian)   
    
    

Thing is, now I barely know what my character wants to do anymore. The amount of ridiculousness and bad desisions has skyrocketed: the current Monk player was known to venture into Chaotic Stupid territory more than once (the latest example was squirting 5 galons of mayonnaise on the walls of a cavern to mask our scent); the Paladin is an outright idiot way too devoted to Ilmather, making people suffer and *rats*; the Fighter, while being the most game-savvy of the group, spews raunchy humour, and wants to find enough growth potions to have sex with a giant and survive (he accidentally ate a genderbender fish, btw); the Sorcerer is constantly making bad decisions and getting into trouble (which is a trend carried over from his Barbarian character).    
   
The only sane character within the group was the Rogue, and she *left* (by that I mean the player rolled up a Bard).   
   
To say that the group was heroic would be lying: the party did many abhorrent things, killed and maybe cannibalized party members they didn't trust, accidentally slaughtered *40 people, children and women included*, and yet still continue on with the game, on a quest to save Faerun from the Giants.   
   
   

As for me, I have no idea how my character would react to all this. All I get is the subconcious desire to not interfere with whatever bullshittery these people are doing. Sure, I genuinely enjoy the ridiculousness along with everyone else - my laughter is as genuine as it can be. But at the same time, I feel like a sane character stuck in a cheap comedy flick with Adam Sandler or smth.   
   
The only time when I *do* useful stuff is combat. But even then I have to constantly leaf through the bloody spellbook to cast *something* useful when my turn comes, at the same time realizing how much spells I *could* use for this encounter but cannot because I *didn't load them up after a long rest*. And try my best to keep up with my 25 movement speed, cuz these people are running around doing their own thing. And it's *absolutely excruciating* to know that I have a metric ton of spell options that I can use to make people's life easier, and that I failed to predict that we will need Water Walk or Sending at that exact event.   
   
So, what's preventing me from removing this character and making a new one?   
   
For starters, the fact that when new characters are introduced, their level must match the lowest in the party. This means that, currently, whatever I introduce will be lvl 6. A 3 levels difference that will be hard to gain back on short notice. It took me *a lot* to gain those levels, I am *finally* decent at my combat role, and I am afraid of losing what I have gained class-wise.   
   
Secondly, my Cleric is the only one with the Revives, and my healing is better than anyone else's.   
   
And thirdly, I simply fail to imagine what kind of a person would willingly join this group, that has a reputation of ""cities they left behind end up burnt to the ground""; who were granted a patch of land near Orlabar, under the pretence of ""please stay there and don't do anything again please""; the ones who are...I just don't have enough words for this.   
    
And before you ask, no, leaving the group and finding a different one is *out of the question.* It took me *a long time* to find a group of people that are *genuinely interested* in having a good time playing DnD. Not a paid DM who does this as a job, but a group of *true enthusiasts*. If I leave this one, I will be *stranded*, so leaving is *not an option.*",8,1585000101,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnsqaq/help_disconnected_from_the_character_too_much_at/,DnD,1

First time DMing for friends who have never played before. I'm not that experienced, done a couple of short campaigns and one shots with friends who have been doing it for years, but the prospect of being stuck inside alone for the coming months spurred me to organise this over Discord. 

Added challenge is it's a story I wrote myself. I've been working on it for about 6 months to do with my main D&amp;D group, but given the situation I thought I'd test it and my skills on this new group. It'll be good keeping me focused and busy thinking about all the NPCs and how they tie into the mythos I'm creating. 

Overall I think it went really well. They picked up the basics, especially around skill rolls, very quickly and threw themselves into the roleplay - from the respectful yet opportunistic Dwarf Paladin to the proud and disdainful Cleric. They picked up on tips of things to explore further, including being finding a prophecy linked to an enchanted item they earned.

I could have returned home, but instead decided to run the session anyway and replace the other player, while thinking of how to include the next player somewhere in the next session.

While waiting for the others he said something along the lines of ""Idk, I think DnD is not for me... It's so exhausting and long"", I then said that the game shouldn't be exhausting for you, it shouldn't be work or something you exert so much force into or anything. You should just relax and enjoy the experience as is, like a movie that you're naturally part of. Even though others didn't come, I still enjoyed the session and even though I wasn't as prepared as I could have been due to lack of motivation (or rather I just couldn't work on it as naturally as I usually do) and such time gaps.

During the game, I tried to observe him and his expressions, and it looked like he did have fun occasionally and the general smile on his face told me that it's not so bad, especially when we all laughed our heads off in some places. *We have all played together for some time now, including a few years ago and this is far from the first campaign, and this was never an issue.* Not to mention, about 3-4 weeks ago he told me ""Man I miss some good ol' DnD, would be nice if you can make a one-shot or something"".

I understand that it may be his opinion and what he said is true, and I am willing to accept that. However, at the same time, I feel like it's more of his mindset or approach to the game that's giving these results. Have any of you experienced similar problems like these and how did/would you approach this?

In case he does really not want to play, I would have to find another place to do this, which wouldn't really be the problem, the fact that he's one of my close friends without whom otherwise there will be only 2 players besides me, it really won't feel the same way and there will be even less roleplay. I don't even know if the other players would play if he's not there considering they are making a discord server for RP (which I am helping with as well). I just also hope I am not going to end up being with only one player because I don't think I'll be able to find anyone else.",9,1584997158,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnrtwd/one_of_my_players_who_is_also_a_close_friend/,DnD,1

The Blurb is mildly toxic, but only when ingested raw, in which case requires a con save of DC12.

They primarily feed off of small insects, and live in lush forests and creeks, most active during spring and summer.

I am only a few weeks into my first DND campaign! Loving every second of it, and I continue to stretch my creative muscles in game.

I would love some help from some of you vets out there. I recently found a gambling table during our campaign where I bet almost all my gold and lost it all, but not without rolling a nat 20 to swipe the winner and get a gem from his pocket.

Our GM had me roll when I got it appraised and found out it was an emerald uncommon gem. Currently I have a dwarf creating into some type of throwable knife or something TBD.

Again, total noob here. My GM is my best buddy who got me into the game and is getting me (even more) hooked on the game by helping him with the home brew item.

fnqt3g,Novice89,Test out my logic puzzle for me??,"I'm writing a Level 17 One-Shot adventure for a D&amp;D Adventures group that I'll be going to once this whole Corona situation is manageable/over. My fiancee and I are hoping to find a couple good players to recruit for a home game like used to host before we moved across the country. With my fiancees schedule always being free the same day of the week is very rare so by hosting and myself DMing, it's easier to play a continuous story/campaign. Plus being the host is great, I can play in whatever clothes I want, food is easier, we have a dog who doesn't do well alone so we don't have to worry about her, and this way we don't have to lug our minis and dice and everything back and forth.

Anyway, all that is background as to why I'm really trying to write a great One-Shot adventure to entice any good players we come across when we do play. I'm buying and painting all the minis this adventure might require, and if time allowed I might even try to make some cool battle maps. So please let me know if this logic puzzle is fun, but most importantly that it is solvable!

I plan on handing out little tables to every player, and depending on their Intelligence modifier for every +1 bonus I will black out/darken one of the cells indicating one of the options that does not apply to give them an advantage like their characters. I'll also allow each player 1 Intelligence roll against a DC 12. If they succeed I will black out 1 cell.

Pulling the lever with any of the answers wrong will result in the PC who pulled the lever suffering 10 points of Necrotic damage. Pulling the lever with all the correct answers will see both doors to the room open.

Entering the room your party examines the pedestal in the center and finds it full of spinning dials. All of them currently read blank, but reveal different words when spun. There are twelve dials are  split into three columns beneath text that reads, ‚ÄúShavyre the Wise,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeelic the Mysterious,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCalagail the Cunning.‚Äù The top row of dials when spun is blank, Necromancy, Divination, and Abjuration. The second row reads blank, 73, 387, and 266. Third row reads blank, Strongest, Middle, Weakest. The fourth and final row reads blank, Human, Elf, and Gnome. On the far right hand side of the pedestal is a short lever that appears as though it can be pulled down. 

At the top of the pedestal is an inscription that says, ‚ÄúA mind is the most powerful thing in all the planes. Correctly match the information to the first three members of the Five to gain entry to my tower.‚Äù

‚ÄúShavyre is not a human‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Divination wizard is younger than the Necromancy Wizard‚Äù
‚ÄúHeelic did not focus on Divination‚Äù
‚ÄúShavyre is older than the gnome, but not the Necromancy Wizard‚Äù
‚ÄúThe youngest wizard was also the weakest‚Äù
‚ÄúCalagail is the most powerful‚Äù

Here is the table I will be passing out to each player. Hopefully I formatted this right. It will look a bit clearer than this but this was the best I could do here.

Empty Column| Shavyre the Wise| Heelic the Mysterious| Calagail the Cunning

So I've been DMing a module for about half a year now. I jumped into the DM chair a bit sooner then I would like and have been chugging along for awhile. Recently though I've been rethinking the module and have been saving a lot of changes if/when I DM the module again in the future. 

But with this in mind, I've been wanting to implement these new changes to the current game I'm still running, but we are halfway through the game already and don't want to just retcon a bunch of stuff. 

The reason being is that in retrospect, I'm not happy with the old decisions I made in regards to the campaign layout and side quests I established. The players never took a bite for the quest hooks, but I did lay them out for the characters and establish them on the map. It's online, so it wouldn't be a huge deal to just take em out, but I don't know how to go about it or how to explain the changes to the players if I do.

Well, I‚Äôm a big fan of Bloodborne, and thought the Stake Driver would be a fun thing to try and make; the question is... How would you make it?

I‚Äôm thinking the overall weapon will weigh 5-8 pounds; it‚Äôll consist of steel/iron (maybe plated with Silver later), and require some springs. There‚Äôs no pistons in DnD yet; so you‚Äôll need to use manual strength to tug the stake back, which might require a strength requirement to wield (maybe 13).

(Thief takers are people that get paid to track down criminals and bring them in) In the books, thief-takers often use sword breakers, and it seemed really cool so I took a stab (sorry lol) at making it in 5e.

It's basically a dagger that trades off the ability to be thrown for a way to parry certain weapons in a way I hope is useful without being overpowered.

* Mirrored sunglasses to ensure his gaze never fully meets somebody else's.

Though so far the only idea's I've come up with have been to bump up the classes hit die from a d10 to a d12, and making the crimson rite damage 2 rolls of the hemocraft die, rather than one, but still only roll the single die for amplifying blood curses and activating the crimson rite.

Hi everyone! I'll be setting up a Homebrew campaign series on Roll20 using original and player collaborative content! I am signing on committed parties/players for the series asap. I'm turning to DM'ing because of the quarantine's unfortunate economic effect. I work in live events, and my fiancee works in Travel. Our industries are crippled, so we are turning to our skills to try and make some money during the ""healing."" I will be hosting Introductory, no-cost one-shots every day after 3/23 until my time is filled. If you or any of your players are interested, in joining the one-shots, please let me know and I will begin building sessions. the one-shots will be the first chapter and canon in the campaign! If you like your session and my DM style enough to continue the story, we can discuss making that happen after the game.  
Limit: 8 players per session  
Length: 2-4 hour sessions / Approximately 12 sessions in the first arc.  
Character Building: Unlimited, but if not published by WoTC, you must be approved by me before the first session  
Stats: Rolled 4d6drop1d6 at the first 30 minutes of the first session  
Voice &amp; Video: Voice required, video not required  
Dice: All digital rolls  
Cost of the ongoing campaign after 1-shot: $12.50 per PC per session to be paid before the session begins via PayPal. For the same cost as a cinema ticket, you are shaping a fantasy world choice by choice.  
The Campaign will be fully produced with lighting, audio, costumes, acting, the set you see, and a world that will be tailored to your character's edgy pasts and future goals. If you are interested in joining in the experience, gather your party and PM me!

fnoxnl,Nudebovine1,Just got my 20andMe DND results and it's caused a whole new session in my life.," Back story: I am a blonde, tall human. My mother is a light haired human baker and my father is a brown haired human farmer. Grew up on a farm, didn't think there would be much in life except watching the flock and tilling the soil.

One of my friends discovered last year he has a bloodline going back generations that gave him magical powers. It's been a real hit at the barn dances with the ladies. So I decided to get myself checked out with a 20andMe DND test. Now I wish I'd just been satisfied staring at sheep.

It came back that I was half half-elf (not quarter elf, those poor slobs). I'm torn up, clearly I can't be my father's child. I don't know what to say or to do. I think I need to talk to mom first. Wish me luck everybody.

EDIT\* It was all true. Dad called mom a pretty-boy trollup and took off. I'm not happy with her but more upset with Dad. Can I still call him that? I'm super confused.

Edit 2\* I've started to hear things from the animals around me. Mutterings, or intent of their calls. It's like as soon as I knew more about me I gained magical and instant insight into the world. You'd think these things would take time but NOPE! I can't get the dang mice to shut up at night.

EDIT 3\* Thanks for all the support folks. I need it more now then ever. I've ended up hearing the call of a great destiny and am now travelling through terrible wilderness in the rain and mud for Gods only know why. And the jerks WON""T TELL ME! I miss staring at the backside of sheep. Well, at least when I didn't know what they were thinking back.

With all of this quarantine stuff going on, I decided to use some time to get back into my hobbies AND make some money, since not a lot of us can work right now. So I'm doing affordable commissions!  


I tend to be pretty quick with my doodles, so for now I can offer them for real cheap: the Standard deal offers a full character portrait, and it isn't finished until it's exactly how you want it. My cartoonish style also makes for great print-and-play miniatures, so I am also offering a Deluxe deal, which has the character mirrored so you can cut it out, fold it up, and use it as a mini, as well as shading and highlights. If you want to go even further than that, the Deluxe+ deal includes art for the character's back. That way, your mini feels even more personalized, and you can make the battlefield a bit more dynamic.  


[Here](https://imgur.com/a/U1Zz2PR) are some examples of the kind of artwork I can offer. I intentionally went with bright, vivid colors here to make them stand out, but I am happy to work with you on any sort of color scheme you would like for your character. Pictures of the Deluxe+ deal and of the paper minis in action are coming soon!  


**Pricing:**

* Standard: $10
* Deluxe: $15
* Deluxe+: $22

I can also do mounts/pets/familiars/sidekicks/etc. at additional cost. If you're interested in anything like that, just let me know and we'll work it out :)

1) Due to the current quarantine rules in my country, I can't invite any of my friends over, and even if I could, none of them would be interested. I'm stuck with my mum and my sister, who both find tabletop RPGs and fantasy stuff stupid and boring, and I'm not allowed to play online.
2) I've read the player's handbook three times and am trying to wrap my head around all of the intricacies. I have no idea what the different editions mean, or  how levelling works, or how to fill in the character sheets, or what the 4d7 things mean - is it like maths where you multiply 4 x d x 7? Does anyone possibly have any advice?
I am so sorry, I know you're probably shaking your head at my stupidity, but I don't know where to start and would love to start playing. I'd really appreciate some expert Reddit help.

fnnll6,DanDaSolo,Tseasci Playable Race for D&amp;D 5e,"Hey guys, for any and all Elder Scrolls + D&amp;D fans out there, here's a Playable Race for D&amp;D called Tseasci. It can be used either for a Tamriel campaign (if anyone's actually doing those) or just in standard D&amp;D, like I am. Just think of a way you made it here from a far away continent, is my advice. Feel free to use if interested!

**Tseasci ‚Äì From TES**

***Quick Hands.*** Tseasci are generally very nimble. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Resilience.***  Due to your snake-like body, you have resistence to poision damage and advantage on saving throws against all poisons.

***Scent Detection.*** Sticking your forked tongue out, you find it very easy to detect smells and scents. For all perception checks based on smell, you have advantage on the skill check. This includes detecting life-forms, so long as it is a species you have already encountered during your life. To use this trait on lifeforms, you must explicitly say that you are searching for the scent of lifeforms. Their scents do not travel far, though, and you can only smell lifeforms within 60 feet.

***Tseasci Immortality.*** This race of Snake-Men from a far-away continent actually have no true lifespan, and they live forever unless they succumb to illness or die in battle. Little is known of Tseasci culture and tradition due to very little contact with members of their species, but it is assumed that Tseasci reach adulthood at around fifty years of age.

***Alignment.*** Nearly all known members of the Tseasci race have been hostile to others, and it is assumed they tend to align either chaotic neutral or lawful evil. Whether this is biologically ingrained in their minds or due to their culture and upbringing, is not widely known.

***Size.*** Tseasci tend to stand with about half of their bodies, with the rest on the floor to provide balance. Standing like this, they tend to be 5 to 7 feet tall.

***Weight.*** Due to your snake-like density, you are very, very heavy. You weight somewhere around 1000 to 1500 pounds.

***Slithering Speed.*** Tseasci are very fast while slithering on their snake-like lower bodies. Your movement speed is 35 feet.

***Hypnotic Stare.*** Staring into your eyes, most individuals will feel a certain tug on their minds that will make them more susceptible to your will. Once a day between long rests, you can use this ability on a humanoid target that can see you to get advantage on skill checks that would charm or persuade them.

***Languages.*** You can read and speak Tseasci (although your character will probably be one of the few of your race alive on the continent) and Common.

***Tseasci Combat Training.*** In the few times in recorded history that Tseasci were sighted, they fought extremely well in small and organized units, where defending the warriors one‚Äôs left and right was imperative (similar to Spartan Hoplites, if it helps to imagine it). If you find yourself standing in between two allies during combat, and one of them is attacked with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to roll a Dexterity saving throw to try and block it. If you roll higher than the enemy‚Äôs attack roll, you successfully block the attack, and your ally takes no damage, if you roll less, than your ally takes half damage.  
 Choice equipment for Tseasci soldiers was a one-handed weapon and a shield. You are proficient in all One-handed and Versatile Weapons and Shields. Tseasci warriors were also trained to wear Dragonscale Armour. You are proficient in Light and Medium Armours.",10,1584983438,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnnll6/tseasci_playable_race_for_dd_5e/,DnD,1

fnna58,sAD_bOi423,One mistake,"I was playing DnD on a new campaign with my friends online and we made new characters. We were doing the ice spire module in the DnD essentials kit for a quick little campaign. I was running a little chaotic neutral kenku rogue that liked to play harmless tricks and was very energetic. Half of the players was kinda like an asshole like in another campaign, they would frame me for everything and tried to burn me every chance they get. The would also do random shit and I guess they were trying to be funny. I was the neutral-good character in the other campaign and I got tired for being the only serious person that is trying to do a quest. Their alignments doesnt match what they do in the game. They say that they are ""Good"" but all I see is them making me look bad. They would constantly try to attack me or order their slave (dont ask how) to attack me or frame me even. So I wanted to take a break and do a chaotic character for once.

Back to our current campaign, they would constantly make jokes on that they should cook the kenku or saying that kenku sucks. I would just ignore it and moved on with the quest. We finished it and this is where I did my mistake. The questgiver was afraid of dragons since there is a dragon roaming within that area. When we were about to report, I tried to make a sound of a dragon using the mimicry feature of the kenku. The DM rolled some dice and suddenly said that the BBEG, The young white dragon Cryovain, was in Phandalin and apparently heard my dragon impersonation and took it as an insult. We were a lvl 2 party so we had no chance against him. Cryovain asked to give him the one who did the poor dragon impersonation so he can spare the party. The whole party except the cleric grappled me and threw me near the dragon however, as the dragon was about to take me, the cleric tried to defend me and he got taken instead. Cryovain then said that he will give us 10 days before our cleric get eaten and then he left. I felt bad and thought that we were gonna laugh it off but the party just straight up got angry at me for doing that. I said I was sorry but they said I should've been the one who died. The people who said that were the ones who derailed the other campaign many times. I got so pissed. So I can't make mistakes while you guys can purposely derail the campaign? It was bullshit. Why can't I roleplay a chaotic character? I didn't know Cryovain was there because the DM rolls for it. I try to play a serious character and I get made fun of. I try to make a little bit of a gag character and they hate me for it. It's so unfair and it feels like im always against the entire game. My DM from the other campaign was cool enough to give them disadvantage when they try to cast spells on me like Charm Person so I wouldn't get harrassed that much but on our current campaign it was another DM who sticked mostly by the rules and more strict. I didn't say ""It's what my character would do"" because I don't want to become too chaotic and be an asshole to everyone. Those 2 players were the ones who weren't trying to roleplay. They just wanted to harrass me. I got so angry that I wont be even trying to speak anymore and just try to help them at quests. But I wont interact with them and will only speak if I need to but ill just be there, scouting and looking for traps. If im trying to play seriously, they shit on me and if I play a little bit chaotic, they get angry. They arent harrassin the character, they are harrassing the player.",5,1584982379,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnna58/one_mistake/,DnD,1

fnmwop,Doomwaffel,[3.5e] Assassin PrC Homebrew changes,"I am planning around a rogue/assassin character in a 3.5e setting. (Mostly core) Pretty straight forward, but since poisons (craft/use) is rather crappy in 3.5e as well as the death-attack, I was tinkering around some alternative designs.

Basically I want the class for the flair, but mostly for the spells, because nothing beats spells in 3.5e \^\^

So what could this look like?  
 **4 &gt; 6 Skill points / Lv**  
**Maybe 1 more spell /Level**  


**Poison use:** Nice flair, but either completely dependent on the DM or not particularly good unless you get the book of vile darkness. Would likely go with Craft Poisonmaking.  


**Alternative:** Either just scrap it or use something more elegant, like what PF2e does with its poison use for rogues, which gives them a /day use for 1d4 poison damage. More poisons and dmg if you level it up.  


**Death attack:** Very cool for flair, but I only remember seeing this being used once or twice in years of gaming. The save isn't impressive either even with high INT, it would be enough to kill a mage or something else that would die from a sneak attack anyway. XD  


**Alternative:** (basically just a copy of a feat from one of the books, but I cant remember what it was) You still get to do 1/2 of your sneak attack damage against flanked enemies, even if they are otherwise immune to sneak attacks.  
I basically only improved everything, so let me know if you think this is too much, or still ok? What are your thoughts and ideas?",4,1584981121,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnmwop/35e_assassin_prc_homebrew_changes/,DnD,1

fnlynd,buttstuffisbeststuff,Energy Storing Elements,"Is there a way of storing magic/elemental energy? Like I know you use a really expensive ruby to cast simulacrum. Can you perhaps store lightning energy from a brass dragons Draconis fundamentum in a 5000Gp diamond? Or! If you put an ioun stone of greater absorption in there, I might work. What are your thoughts? Is there something already in place for something like that?

P.S. This is meant to go with an item I‚Äôm trying to make. A bracelet to go with the bracer of flying daggers. It has things like dried poison and acid. You take a dagger, scrape it on the element to get some powder, and if it hits, it‚Äôll do damage. I don‚Äôt wanna enchant the bracer, so this is the next best thing I could think of. Plus it gives me more than one element to work with. I just don‚Äôt know how to get things like fire or radiant damage.",3,1584977842,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnlynd/energy_storing_elements/,DnD,1

Amazing DM, great group of players, some with a lot more experience than me, some brand new. 

I started with a druid, circle of the moon and he died promptly after reaching level 5. I almost quit and I‚Äôm so glad that I didn‚Äôt because my DM worked with me and helped me build a sweet new martial character that I couldn‚Äôt have been happier with. Strong, extra movement because of class and a really cool combination of race and subclass. 

However, having leveled up twice since then and reaching Omu, I‚Äôve realized something. Martial classes plateau in a way that casters just don‚Äôt. 

I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as sour grapes, I love my character, party and DM. I am just curious what ways you all have found to help encourage equitable growth between classes, specifically what I currently see as a fundamental disparity between casters and martial classes.",15,1584977500,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnlv6v/as_casters_get_exponentially_stronger_at_higher/,DnD,1

Hopefully to help brighten your days slightly, I wanted to introduce you guys to my new podcast - [RanDMised Podcast](https://randmised.co.uk/). 

In our take on the classic DnD structure, we don't have a single DM... We have 4. With a new DM chosen at the end of each session randomly using a standard D4, continuing the same narrative. 

We have a skeleton story which has been set for us by the first DM, but how that story is fleshed out depends entirely on who next DMs. This could be absolute chaos, it could go off without a hitch, we don't know until we try. 

We have released 5 episodes so far, this includes an little introductory episode where we lay out the rules and introduce you to the guinea pigs... I mean players, and 4 full episodes. 

Moving forwads we are releasing two episodes a week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. 

You can listen via the majority of different platforms:

They love the planes, history and all things arcane, especially Lore on the lost and forgotten. His ultimate wizard goal is to create a lair that is a series of lost and forgotten, existing demiplanes and locations, stitched together that he can then spend an eternity researching. A museum of curiosities and puzzles they can call home. 

His second goal is to create a vehicle capable of moving through the planes and even into space. This way he can always explore, discover, learn and add new areas to his lair. 

My first instincts were Conjuration or Transmutation but I just can't figure it out as it seems like a mix of stuff. I m open to homebrew or material from othe republished books if there's something I'm overlooking.

fnlmy4,DMKanna,The opposite of a Folk Hero is...?,"SO I am running a campaign where one of the my PCs is a wanted criminal back on his home island. The set up for the campaign is that this Character was invited by a council for the island chain to be a hero to fend off invaders. This group is also a theocracy and so the decision to invite him was made by a speaker for the gods. He's been pardoned by the governing council and agreement that this pardon is legal across the island chain is recognized. However, governments and people do not always agree and so in the eyes of the citizens of his home island he is still a wanted criminal. 

So I am dubbing this unique situation a 'Folk Criminal'. It isn't really the characters official backstory, more a summary to help me in note taking and storytelling. I also plan to have this play a role as in the last session this PC played an integral part in fending off an invading navy and preventing loss of life on his home island. Things were a bit hectic and so no one made mention of him leading the militia, but now in the aftermath of the battle, well things are going to get dicey for him.

fnl03u,PB_Dendras,dungeon crawler,"I want to start a dungeon crawler game with a dungeon of 80 floors (it will take some time). On each floor there is a stair case up and a stair case down (except on the first floor because nothing goes up there). Every four levels they go down, they gain a level, so by the time they make it to the bottom, they'll be level 20.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to scatter some magic items around each floor. Common for level 1-5, Uncommon for level 6-10, Rare for level 11-15, and Legendary for level 16-20. The players get a simple description of the item they're holding but have no clue what it actually does. In what range should I put the monsters then? How much higher should there CR be? How many monsters should be on each floor if there's only one item on each floor + potions.  


For the potions, half are good and half are bad. When they drink, they'll know the effect.

1. Healing (+1d8 HP)
2. Harming (-1d8 HP)
3. Strength (+1d6 STR for 1 minute)
4. Weakness (-1d6 STR for 1 minute)

fnkv5e,Apprentice_of_Lain,[help] Justifying a radical cleric of a Light deity in Faerun.,"I was wondering what it would take to create a ""PURGE THE HERETICS"" type of character, loosely inspired by Warhammer 40k: a zealot on a quest to expand the influence of the One True Faith.   
   
Since Light Domain clerics have spells themed around light and fire, I thought it was a good choice.   
   
Problem is, most Light God churches (Lathander, Amaunator, etc) are not *really* the radical ""purge the unclean"" type, and the only one that *does* is basically a Fire Elemental (which doesn't sound very ""pro-human"" to me).   
   
Now, there *was* an idea to establish worship of Bahamut's aspect - something like a ruthless but just Dragon Tyrant - but I don't think a deity can dip into other domains just because of a group of followers (Bahamut's default Domains in 5e are War and Life, I think).   
   
Another idea was to add a ""branch"" to the Church of Lathander/Amaunator, that interprets the doctrines in a radical fashion. The trouble with that is justifying how a substantial radical movement can exist within a pre-established Church and *not* get hunted down for being *too cruel*.    
    
Personally, I'm out of options here. Any help appreciated.",7,1584973772,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnkv5e/help_justifying_a_radical_cleric_of_a_light_deity/,DnD,1
fnkuy9,cslwoodward1,‚ÄúI hope I can one day make a character moment feel as awesome and excited as you made me feel. 10/10 session‚Äù- my player.,"Tonight we had our first game of dnd online (due to you know what) and so it was an experiment and experience for us all. We were delayed in starting, had no background music and were doing climatic parts of Descent into Avernus. I found dming to be tough, not seeing everyone at all times when switching between tabs or laggy internet or everyone talking at once or just not thinking I could pull it off as effectively as in person. It was a lot of plates to balance.
And yet it turned out to be a blast for everyone, especially our paladin who got to have a real moment to shine.

**Create Bonfire** is a good control spell that's also good for igniting things. It doesn't specify that it emits light, but I think that it would be silly for a DM to interpret it otherwise. As a concentration spell, it can even burn underwater.  


**Produce Flame** works for both utility and offense. Directly states that it emits light, and can be thrown if necessary. It lasts for 10 minutes and doesn't require concentration.

* Shillelagh
* Produce Flame/Create Bonfire

fnkfto,P4ramed1c,Escalation,"So in my head I have this idea of a perfect session that keeps blowing the minds of players over and over again as the game keeps escalating. Kinda like how the climax of Just Cause keeps getting crazier and crazier till you're fist fighting on the back of 2 nuclear missiles. I guess the idea for this thread is to give me a situation you found yourself and your party in recently and i'll try to escalate it and make it crazier. Or just to talk about when this would be a good thing to put into your game. 

I personally think it would be fun to do this on the climax of a campaign. Like come in with a crazy premise and just ride it as crazy as it will go. There are benefits to having a really structured and pre-written climax, but I think that there are ways that you can keep the benefits of writing a bunch of stuff and still cater to someone who has more skill in improvising..",1,1584972116,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnkfto/escalation/,DnD,1

‚ÄúWar changes people, companions. 3 years ago, it was a grand day. It was the night of the year we paid tribute to our Goddess, Hiatea. My mother and sister had gathered berries as they had always done. My father, my younger brother, and I hunted game, but only took what we needed. We never bothered man, giant nor beast. We took pride in our simple, solitary life. As is the way of my people. We gathered our offering and placed it on the small shrine our mother carried, a shrine she had for as long as I could remember. It was the perfect night: a full harvest moon, thousands of stars, and a small fire that let of dozens of cinders into the sky. We prayed, we ate, and we slept. Fire. Screams. Blood. That‚Äôs what I woke to. The Verbeeg of the Eastern Mountains butchered my family for sport. I rushed out of bed to help, but someone pulled my hand from touching the door. It was a human. A large human, but I could tell he was not of Verbeeg blood. He said ‚ÄòThis feeling you have, the hatred, the anger, the agony. Use it. For I am Hoar, the Doombringer. Rise your fathers blade in my name. Avenge those whom you held so dear.‚Äô Without hesitation, I reached for his blade and stormed the brutes that began celebrating their victory. Now they lie rotting in a place I once called home. We were a small clan, with no name, but we were happy. They stole it, so I will never forgive or trust a Verbeeg or any Giant-kin.

fnk40n,spideyismywingman,Roleplaying a Mindflayer.,"I'm currently DMing a game for a group of newly level 5 characters, one of whom is a GOO warlock of Cthulhu. I want the next phase of the campaign to be kicked off by the warlock's patron warning him of an incoming threat and charging him with a secret mission, but... a level 5 character isn't exactly going to be worthy of Cthulhu's direct attention. Hell, a level 5 character would probably be incapable of processing Cthulhu's presence! So I'm planning for a scion of Cthulhu to reach out to the warlock and act as a contact - the natural choice feels like a Mindflayer.

With that in mind, the next session is (likely) going to kick off with that character meeting a friendly(ish) Mindflayer, probably via the spell Dream, and I'm struggling to think how to roleplay that character with enough weight to make them seem impactful and otherworldly. Has anyone ever played a Mindflayer NPC for anything other than a direct antagonist (he could well evolve into an antagonist further down the line, or a powerful ally, but I want that to be dependent on party choices really) and how did it go?",1,1584970737,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnk40n/roleplaying_a_mindflayer/,DnD,1
fnk377,SirGrizz87,Feel like I was introduced to D&amp;D just to become a DM,"Sorry this got away from me, guess I really needed to vent

TL:DR Recently started playing D&amp;D and feel like I got tricked into being the DM only after three sessions of actually playing. 

&amp;#x200B;

First off I would like to say this is kind of a rant, wouldn't mind some input on this situation. I've had this friend for most of my life. He has always been into D&amp;D and I always showed interest but never had time to play really. My schedules would always conflict with the rest of the groups so on so forth. 

Well that was the case in middle school + as I was always the Nerd who played sports and when I had practice/games they would play. Here we are many many years down the road. For the past couple of years he would talk about D&amp;D groups he was in. I would get inspired and look into the game but again my work schedule never lined up and with me moving for a great job it was not considered.

Finally came the day he asked me if I wanted to play online. We would do Discord and a small group. He wanted to DM Tyranny of Dragons with some added stuff. Kept on talking about how he could easily turn this into a 2 year long campaign every other week. I got excited, my wife got on board due to how excited I was and it turned into a group of 4 players and a DM 

Now I dived into this, read the PHB and all the rules I could find. I wrote an elaborate back story about a Dragonborn Paladin and his clan, gave tons of character hooks as to why he becomes Vengeful (Oath of Vengeance) towards Tiamat and the cultists who follow her. After he read it, it wasn't long before he started mentioning I might like DMing (which might be the case) we get one session in and as he is DMing I am trying to encourage more detail and he just kept saying ""It just is"" when I questioned something. There was combat rules that he stated differently than the PHB and when I questioned it he almost killed my character (luckily I rolled a two Nat20s in a row and escaped or else I would have been dead). 

Might I add this is the first session, my wife who never shown interest is now questioning if she even wants to play because of his attitude, I message him privately asking him what is up and he just says he wants to play and he thought I would want to DM. I explained to him again that I actually want to play the game before I try to run one. That I am not opposed to learning to DM down the road but I really want the experience so I know what I should give players. He doesn't say much after that and we do one more session in which my wife really enjoyed. We got a lot of combat in, she figured out a clue to something and actually invested time and effort into her character with a back story. 

At the start of the third session he tells everyone that his work is getting more demanding and he can no longer DM. Seeing my wife crushed cause she started getting into it I step up and go to DM. After I step up he gets excited and says he will make a character and join the party. I am side playing my Paladin but eventually he will be stepping away from the group. But we are two sessions in and I am enjoying it but I enjoyed playing more. But the thing is, his schedule has not changed. I see him online  at the same times playing the other games we play together

I know if he would have said at the beginning he wanted me to DM from the get go I maybe would have considered it but I feel like I got tricked into DMing and I feel obligated to push through it due to other friends getting invested and my wife. I asked my wife if she wanted to join another game I joined (roll20 pick up game that I am enjoying playing a celestial warlock every week) and she said no that she really likes our current game and she doesn't see herself playing with strangers.

Sorry for the huge wall of text but I really wanted to vent. I am told I am good at DMing, I know the rules well and try to be fair. I do enjoy the story telling but I am trying to not let this feeling like I was forced to DM impact the game. So any suggestions on how to do that?",14,1584970638,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnk377/feel_like_i_was_introduced_to_dd_just_to_become_a/,DnD,1

fnirmx,Nirdee,Hot Take: Ability Scores Increases are not well designed,"The choice between ability score improvements and Feats miss the mark on an interesting player choice. Although it certainly can be a hard decision (which is a good thing) on whether to Feat or ASI, ability score improvements don't make any meaningful changes to your in-game decisions. If you take ASI, you just do whatever you were already doing better. Feats give you interesting choices when you choose them, and often after you've taken a Feat, you have new and interesting decisions and options while playing. The poor design part is that ASI levels force the player to choose between statistical optimization and interesting mechanics.

Other problems exist with ability scores. Racial ability scores lead to a lot of archetypes and cliche race/class ability combos--but maybe you can argue that it a nice soft way of making gnome barbarians or dwarf wizards uncommon without outright banning them. And maybe the 1 to 30 ability score scale is silly when it just translates to a -5 to +10 modifier--but that is just a little bit of untidiness that captures some tradition or nostalgia, no real difference. 

The ASI vs Feat thing seems harder to defend to me. Yes, Feats are optional. Yes, the game is not a simple roll off for bigger numbers. Yes, some Feats are just different kinds of stat bonuses. 

This post was meant to be a casual observation and ended up with me ranting like someone locked in a room with too much time--oh yeah, right. 

Anyhow, suggested house rule: Every ASI level gives a character a +1 to one ability score AND a Feat of their choice. With this rule, the choice is between interesting mechanics, and the ASI that comes with some Feats can be seen as a balancing mechanic for less applicable Feats. Although you lose the tough choice of Feat or no Feat, you get two choices--which Feat and which ASI--that are pretty fun.",22,1584964752,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnirmx/hot_take_ability_scores_increases_are_not_well/,DnD,1

The problem is not that they are rule-lawyers or meta-gamers, even if everyone is a little focused on optimization, but rather that everyone at the table knows the rules so well, and is so engaged in the game that they read up on every UA, every forum about multiclassing and everything else, so that they don't make choices in the game that are not extremely well thought through.

fnij7q,thebonnfire5689,Changeling quest narrative help needed,"Folks, somewhat new DM here. I've got a relatively solid structure for an upcoming session but I'm struggling to piece it all together, getting ye olde writers' block figuring out the mechanics and flow of the quest. Here's what I have so far, would love input on how to connect the dots:

\*The group (a rogue tiefling, a sorcerer tabaxi, and a fighter dragonborn) is being used as bait for a changeling criminal who is after them, with the trap being a party in the trio's honor at the Jarl's castle. They have been sought out by this changeling before, and the hope is he will strike at the party. The changeling is working for the Jarl's court wizard, who is actually an under cover foreign secret agent.

\*The event is set up to honor the group with an award for rescuing a local knight a few sessions ago.

\*The changeling will be in attendance disguised as one of the local herb merchants with an already established connection to both the Jarl and the group. The court wizard who is pulling the strings will also be in attendance, but I have him up in his chambers during the happenings. My hope was to get the party to head to the forge with the disguised changeling for a battle with him and a few monster helpers (had planned to have his changeling gang help out but the party surprisingly killed them all in a previous encounter lol). This is all a bit shaky and not set in stone.

\*I already have the layout for the castle (3 floors, the main floor, an upstairs with residences, and a basement featuring a forge and dungeon). I have placed some NPC's from around the realm at the party whom they can talk to and acquire other sidequests for later or information on others in attendance.

\*Ideally, they'll encounter the changeling, defeat him, and discover he's working for the wizard who they will confront before he escapes. That, as with any storyline, is malleable to the decisions the players make during the game, but that's the overall concept.

What I'm struggling with is how to organically steer the party towards an encounter with the changeling while keeping the entire encounter realistic and entertaining. We are all relatively new to this (about 3-4 months) but the players are still somewhat lacking in creativity and often need a few nudges towards an objective to keep things moving and interesting. I do as little nudging as possible but it does sometimes get bogged down while they learn how best to handle their characters. Any ideas to help narrative flow? No suggestion is a bad one, at the very least it can hopefully jog my creative juices. Thanks in advance :) feel free to ask questions about our campaign if you have them and I will answer as best I can.

fnidb3,AfterMahem2625,Is it wrong that I am thinking of completely scrapping my current campaign to redo a better one?,"I've been talking to one of my players recently about how they're finding their character and the camogain etc.. And they told me that they were thinking of new character concepts because they feel quite understandably limited with their current choice - kenku. We got to chatting about these concepts and we ended up writing out an entire sheet (backstory included) that I am ridiculously invested in (as the DM). This then got me thinking, what about the rest of the party? Majority of which have been the same PC's since the start of this campaign and primarily picked these characters out of visual appeal above anything else as they were all brand new to the game when we first started.. Why not give them the opportunity to play something more fleshed out? Or more intriguing to them? Or more attuned to their playstyle? Then I started thinking some more. If my players are all getting the opportunity for a fresh start, why can't I as the DM have one too? There have been a number of things I'd have changed if I could have but didnt think of at the time.. Lore dumps that haven't been anywhere near as detailed as I'd like.. Now don't get me wrong I love my campaign and have poured hours and hours of prep time and planning into it.. But we've experienced this leg of the adventure, why not fuck off to the other leg and try again, but better?! 

I've asked my players how they all feel about the situation and definitely have not made any final decisions. But your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!",4,1584962649,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnidb3/is_it_wrong_that_i_am_thinking_of_completely/,DnD,1

fnhi61,Jamesaliba,Player wants to play a mute kalashtar belly dancer,"So the character was born mute and was bullied a lot. As a result they learned dancing to express themselves and relieve stress. 

One day they were bullied so much that they ran out of the village only to come back and see it massacred (original i know). In their darkest moment they started dancing under the rain, a beautiful deep dance that was out of this world, literally. This dance ritual summoned a Quori spirit that fused with the player.

As a result my character became of the Kalashtar race.
  
Now my question is, spell casting related.
  
While usually you need to utter specific words, bards use musical instruments so humming could still work?
  
Or i could just say the shivers of their body (they could also wear shivering clothes) makes sounds. 
  
Both these ways would allow spells like silence to work.   
  
Am i missing anything balance wise? Do you have any suggestions?

fnhgdb,ChaoticDominance,Has anyone tried this type of immersive D&amp;D?,"I'm throwing this here because I'd like to know real thoughts on this subject. I think the ""DMing"" tag works here.   


Has anyone here tried a form of D&amp;D which relies heavily on the person's actual abilities and not only takes those abilities but requires the person to learn new things as their character does. Something that requires props your players makes themselves throughout the day/week and to be used in the campaign which means they can't use it after it's been used.   


So say a Mage/wizard would need to make on actual paper a magic circle. Would have to actually draw it out and such to make the circle on a piece of paper. They would have to repeat this for as many spells as they can and are allowed. Once the game starts they would then use that prop when they need to and then throw it away. That spell is useless until sometime within the week of real life time they make the spell again to be used. Or they put together a actual potion using medical herbs that can be bought at a store or grown themselves. Rouge's would have to learn actual lockpicking to be able to use the skill in game. Warrior's would need to learn some IRL fighting skill to be able to use it.  


So it'd all need to be learned by a person and shown/proven to a GM/DM in order to be used in game. That way it both helps the players and GM/DM grow as a person but it also brings a new and fun element to the games.

fngk1t,PeteQuinnell,Voice Acting With NPCs [Share Your Stories!],"I've been DMing for around a year now, and only been playing D&amp;D for about a year and a half, so I pretty quickly knew I wanted to be a DM. One of the things that always fascinated me about great DMs that I've seen is the wide range of NPCs they display and how amazingly colourful and varied they can all be, with particular attention on voices. I've always had a soft spot for voice acting as a whole, and getting to see more of it in D&amp;D was amazing for me.

Fast forward to one of my latest sessions with my friends. The character I was about to voice was a really creepy character, someone who preyed upon the less fortunate and attempted to recruit them to his group (essentially a sort-of cult). He had scars all over him and a sick, twisted smile (think animated Joker), and the voice I went with for him was a breathy, wheezy kind of voice. The closest thing I can think of would be Voldemort from the first Harry Potter movie.

The instant I did the voice, everyone around the table recoiled noticeably, the tone shifted dramatically, and they took the social encounter with him a lot more seriously. Speaking to the player who had the social interaction with him after the session, he said his heart was racing through the whole thing. Another one of my players commented that this (along with some voices I did during a smaller one-shot I had DM'd earlier in the day, including a bumbling but lovable hill giant) gave off ""real Matt Mercer vibes"", and as a massive fan of Critical Role, that was an insane compliment to me.

So what are your stories about voice acting in D&amp;D? Have you had a killer NPC that the players at your table can't forget? For players, have you introduced a new PC that had everyone at the table rolling with laughter or taken aback by your emotion? I love voice acting, share your stories of voice acting in D&amp;D!",2,1584952366,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fngk1t/voice_acting_with_npcs_share_your_stories/,DnD,1
fngikq,RajoGuna,real world religions in settings,"Hey everyone, if you can't tell by my name, I'm Hindu. I'm a Kashmir Shaivite to be exact, and I love D&amp;D. I also like horror (depending on the genre). I once played a 5e curse of Strahd Campaign, and liked some of the elements and love heavy RP. I also liked Neverwinter Nights so I decided to buy the Enhanced Edition on steam and joined the huge Ravenloft server on there after hearing how big they are on RP.

After my first character, I decided to make a new one, a cleric. I checked out the deity list on their forums to figure out what would be fun to play and saw real world deities. I was confused but curious, and clicked the Indian one which they said referenced the ""Web of Illusion"" and ""3rd edition Ravenloft Campaign Setting"". I don't know a ton about Ravenloft, but i never ran into any of that playing Curse of Strahd.

Shiva and Kali are both listed as evil along with devas like Indra, and with a couple of ""Wut?"" domains. I ask in their discord and basically they say it came from materials from the early/mid 90's and this is escapism and I shouldn't take it seriously.

I don't really find that a convincing argument, because it's a VERY common misconception, and very problematic and sacrilegious portrayal of them. In real life Kali is depicted as killing armies serving evil asuras, and yes she is over darkness but that doesn't mean the same thing to Hindus as westerners and she is also maternal love. Shiva is the destroyer yes, but of ignorance and evil. Just because the original authors wrote it doesn't mean DM's should keep using it or else we would all be using 1.0

Also, I  find the original authors had a missed opportunity. Hinduism has Asuras whom many compete with the Devas for worship. If the original authors of the referenced works or any new ones wanted dark Hindu gods, just literally use Asuras as many were evil. That they even used the deva Indra and made him evil when he fought the overtly evil Asura Vritra, an actual serpent/dragon. It's much more interesting to talk about a group of basically ""anti-gods"" some of whom like the gods and worship them and some of who don't and compete with them instead. 

I know some people might think I should just get over it, but I mean, I feel like D&amp;D should move past some of the problems of earlier editions, including in the lore. 25 years ago (which is when a lot of referenced materials came out) the idea of a gay character would of probably been super taboo and people would or argued how ""realistic"" it was for a hero to be gay, yet I would have a hard time, at least of the GM's I've known, them EVER dissuading someone from making one.

Not just all of that, but for me personally I take my religion seriously. I've even written for a religious group's newsletter before and run my own website about my religion and music as well as wear a mala (prayer beads) 24/7 and at least recite some amount of mantras daily. I'm not as consistent as I'd like in daily practices, but it's still important to me, and negative, common tropes like Kali being evil in the ways they are depicted in anything from this to Indiana Jones (bring up the thuggee cult all you want, they were just bandits mostly irl) can be really harmful and compound cultural bastardization and marginalization of the voices that people totally rip off of without any authentic understanding. It's very frustrating to say the least, and if someone came up on that server or any D&amp;D game I was in, I wold legitimately have to leave the table because I would be afraid of accidentally offending my own gods by helping perpetuate those perceptions of them by way of participating.

Anyways, I just wanted to get that all off my chest here, as I get the sense if I did it on their forum as my first post there, I might get a bunch of angry responses (hey I might here too but I figured less so).",4,1584952126,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fngikq/real_world_religions_in_settings/,DnD,1
fngiib,Erace89,BBEG Decisions?! [5e],"Hey everyone.

So my new campaign is starting soon (hopefully...delays due to COVID19) but I wanted to get the communities opinion on something. 

My plan so far has been to have one of the previous Prime Deities, Northan the Landfather (who was banished by his mother for killing his brother) rise up again through means of this new material/mineral Novium. He would influence those in posession of it, turning them mad and ultimately tearing society apart. His followers would essentially detonate this material to create voids or absences of the Material Plane allowing him to eventually pass through and claim the world for his own. Defeating him would require unique ways of fighting as he is essentially a large black hole.

Now, this seemed like an interesting bad guy as I could play up on the madness, social anarchy and gravity part a lot but...

Part of some of my players backstories has lead me to use a lot of Dragonborn/Yuan-Ti as villains, all headed up by a Cleric Lich who was previously defeated and wishes to claim power once more on behalf of a greater deity (A large serpent dragon oroborus) called The Prismatic Coil. Now I am wondering if I should focus on this as the BBEG to not convolute the story further. I love the idea of this God in terms of just visuals and I am wondering if the other deity has no real connection to the party. Would it be interesting enough to just have the Lich be a backstory boss and just 'try' to bring forth his patron and never actually succeed?

What are your thoughts? Big dark entity made up of essentially a black hole...or a big 5 coloured serpent.

I originally thought if I ever did another campaign after this one, I could use the one I didn't end up using.

fngam6,Anthony_Lionelli,I did a Shrek one shot. It was my first time DMing and also only my second time ever playing.,"Wrecker and Saver of Shet see an ad for the town of Duloc's Lord. So they travel to Duloc and immediately have questions asked of them about the ad from a Drow elf named Eva. Eva follows them and Saver talks to a local who tells them to talk to the barkeep in town. They go to the tavern. And Eva goes over to a Wood elf she sees and says hi and introduces herself. But the wood elf Dabria just kind of doesn't feel like holding a conversation. While that happens Saver and Wrecker talk to the barkeep about the ad and he tells them that there is an enormous amount of monsters at the edge of town. And to go out of the tavern and look to the left and walk a mile and they will be at Lord Farquad the tall and Handsome's castle. So they order a drink. And drink it and then go over to the wood elf and do introductions. Turns out she lives in the woods behind the tavern. But originally from the country Eshen. And Saver and Wrecker is from a town called Shet. Saver was in the front lines defending the village at age 16. And got attacked by a Kobold. And was beaten but before he was killed Wrecker saved him but again was defeated but before he was slain Saver cast a spell and burned the Kobold to death. So Dabria mentioned that she needed money. So Saver and Wrecker invite her to join them in the quest. So they set out from the Tavern and begin on the walk to Farquad's castle. Once they get there 15 minutes later they confront 2 guards at the front gate. Saver walks up to the 2 men and says that they are here to help the Lord with his monster problem. The guards seem suspicious of him. But let him and everyone else in any way. They walked into the castle and talk to the receptionist. They tell them that they are here because of the monsters. And the receptionist tells them to take the right hallway and follow it for about 5 minutes and they will be in Farquad's main chamber. So they walk to the main chamber. And they see the large man that he is. Towers over even the tallest member of the party which is Wrecker which is 6'5. They then mention the ad to Farquad and he tells them that his knights are preoccupied in the swamp. He tells them of the large number of enemies on the edge of town. They say they can handle it. Farquad tells them about the exit behind his thrown room. Saver opens the door and takes a step out and takes another step. Not realizing there is no floor. He then falls on his butt landing where he was just standing. He then notices that there is a ladder that leads to the floor. The party then climbs all the way down and notices a gate with 2 guards and past them, there is a Goblin and 2 Orcs. They charge in and start fighting. The Goblin shoots Dabria in the shoulder. And Dabria shoots one of the orcs. Eva the druid uses her extendo sword to stab the goblin straight in the neck. One of the orcs manifests a javelin and chucks it into Saver's knee. Saver stabs an Orc in the dick. And Wrecker chops the arm off one of the orc's arm off killing it also chopping its toes off. They deal with the monsters and they just look at the 2 guards and are like you guys did absolutely nothing. And one of the guards scoffs and say they could have dealt with it himself. They return up the ladder and go to Lord Farquad. And request a reward. Farquad says 10 gold pieces each. But Wrecker says he wants 15. Farquad says no and tells them they can stay the night. He gets one of his medics to come and heal whoever needed it. They go to the receptionist to collect their gold and get their rooms. Dabria approaches. And just acts like a fool. The receptionist dismisses her. But Wrecker starts to unsheath his sword and asks for the room and gold again. So he gives them the gold and tells them to go to the left hall. There is one room with 4 beds. Wrecker says that Saver doesn't get a bed. But Saver wants a bed so they begin to fistfight. Wrecker promptly punches Saver in the nose and Saver yields. He lays on the ground and begins to cry. He is the first to fall asleep. Then Eva and Dabria begin to have a pillow fight. And then for some reason, Dabria and Eva fight over a bed and Eva knocks Dabria unconscious onto the bed. But Dabria isn't having it. She flings her off the bed. And it doesn't make a sound (she rolled a nat 20 on stealth. I said its the most silent thing you've heard). And Wrecker pushes his 2 beds together and sleeps on both. While Dabria puts her stuff on one and sleeps on the other. The next morning Farquad kicks open the door. And says I need your assistance. He takes them into his main chamber and there is a guard that is missing both of his arms and covered in mud. Saver immediately makes a joke about his armless situation and asks if he needs a hand. And the guy starts crying and Wrecker asks what happened to him. And he responds that an Ogre and Donkey killed the rest of the knights. And Farquad asks them if they can kill the beasts. Wrecker says he better be rewarded. And Farquad said one platinum piece each. Wrecker says 1 platinum and 5 gold and Farquad makes the deal. And as the medic comes in to take the guard away the other guard says ha no arm. And they hear him cry louder as they leave. The group travels to the opposite end of the end of town. They then leave Duloc's walls and walk into the woods and then see a swamp. They see signs that say beware of the Ogre. They continue into the swamp. They go further into the swamp. They see an outhouse. And the ogre kicks open the door. And walks in front of a hut that looks like it was self-made. And then they notice that the Ogre's loincloth is covered in blood and there is a Donkey. Eating a knight. Then Saver starts to dance and impresses the Ogre. He then tries to seduce it. But he just makes it angry. Eva takes the chance to jump over the Donkey and sticks her extendo sword up his anus. Wrecker takes a swing at him with his great sword but misses and Donkey stands on his back legs the blade slips out of his butt. And claws come out of his hoves. And it slashes Wrecker across the chest. And then Saver runs behind Donkey and puts his hands together at his left side. And then puts them up to his anus. Then fire erupts from his hands and shoots through his body roasting him turning his body black and crispy but not killing him. Wrecker then takes a bite of Donkey and gains some health back.  Dabria charges at Ogre which they began to call Shrek. But she misses and stabs his house and her sword sticks in into it. Then Shrek takes his club and smashes Saver through his own house and knocks him unconscious. Eva takes her extendo sword and chops one of Shrek's nipples clean off. And then Dabria tries to pull her sword out of the wall but hits herself in the forehead with the blade. Wrecker then takes an ominous stance. And starts spinning around with his greatsword. And moves towards Donkey turning him into a cooked Donkey soup. Eva then takes a step back and does a triple backflip and takes a chunk out of Shrek's shoulder. Dabria finally gets her stability back. She then stabs him through the ear. Shrek then goes to attack but trips and his great club and impales himself with the handle. Then Wrecker stabs him through the stomach. He stands back up and pulls the great club out of his gut and swings it at Wrecker and swings over his head missing. Wrecker then slices off his other nipple and some of his toes. Dabria cuts off his big toe. And then Eva jumps up and pokes her extendo sword through his head and drags the blade through his body. They search his shack and find 4 potions of health, a bag of holding, and bracers of archery that Dabria put on. And they give health potions to Dabria, Wrecker, and Saver. Saver then takes his water skin and empties it and fills it with the Donkey juice. They head back to town and go to Farquad's castle. They meet with him and he gives him the platinum and gold. They then go to the local tavern and notice there are three bandits robbing the barkeep. Dabria tried to stealth but she took a couple of steps and the ground creaked. They look at her but don't notice the rest of the party. Saver then sneaks to the back of the room and stabs one of the bandits in the head but doesn't kill him. He screams in pain and alerts the others. The party just slaughters them. Wrecker chopped one of them into cubes. The barkeep then gives them free drinks and food. The barkeep asks if they heard of the bounty to help some guards transport serfs of the town of Molgred. And then the bells of the town start ringing and huge gates start opening.

So they start the quest and are mowing down goblins but they get to the orcs cave and start fighting him but he keeps sending out goblins and the players were getting into a tough spot. And I think you need to know is that the Rogue has a magical plus one dagger endless friends that was playing the Rogue had never really played before so he didn't get much Magic So he asked can stick the magical dagger up the wizards butt and I say I don't know if it would do anything but go ahead and roll the D20 just in case. He roles nat 20 and I say sure as long as the wizard gives consent he does so at the time I didn't really get advantage and disadvantage so I just said double damage to every attack that the wizard makes then he One-Shots the orc that just had want to talk to him and it was like 5 damage and then he cast fire ball destroys the cave and the rest of the goblins.

Since no one had experience i decided to take the time and learn at least the basics of being a DM.

Fast forward to our first session (via discord since we re locked down at our houses)
Everything is going fine and we are enjoying some silly interactions in the town (tavern talks and a run to the brothel) suddendly this chaotic evil character starts making the most absurd decisions...

At first we all find it funny how he just runs around doing stuff like ""take a huge dump on the barn where the tavern owner let them spend the night (in which by the way he rolled a nat20)""
One huge messy barn latter and he starts trying to kill every npc they run into and keeps on rolling stupidly high... i managed to save a few of them with just a limb or two missing but everyone he does not kill he just punches them across the face

Since he is part of the party they got dragged into it and ended up killing 5 guardsman, the mayor and trying to kill some other people only due to the fact that the mayor said ""thats not how we do things around here"" when they tried to cut the hand of a thief off.

I was cutting them some slack since it was the first time we were playing. He had to leave like 20 min earlier and left the rest of the party with the fight to finish but they went in so deep that there were no more traits of personalities from the characters, just thirsty killers that wanted to end the lives of everyone around them (?)

I amped up the fight and even rolling an absurd double nat20 on a disavantage roll to the mayor they ended up killing him
This probably changes a lot on the route i will have to take on the campaign but has anyone dealt with a player like this? What do you guys usually do?

fnex09,BD-Caffeine,Problem DM is ruining our enjoyment of the game.,"Don't know where I could post this and it seemed out of game stuff so here it goes.  

Bit of back story, I have been playing with this group for a good 4 years now, three times as a player and once as a DM with campaigns that lasted a year each. I am very familiar with the core group but sadly, partways we had some people leave and in the last year gathered three new players, two newbies and one player who's been playing since AD&amp;D. 

Our new DM is the long time player.  

We have now played four sessions with the new DM. He's made his own campaign, the story is interesting, his world seems well made and we changed systems coming from 5e to Pathfinder 1e.  The system change was hard at first for a few of us but we got the hang of it quickly. We all made characters, detailed back stories except the newbies which is fine. They still have one but not the length of what I call the core group which is I, our ex DM and his wife. 

The big issue is all the combat. Combat is nice, I like PFe1 alright, it's what I got introduced with but I am seriously tired of it. Our ex DM is tired of it. It's exhausting. We literally had 5 hours of combat for a few weeks in a row! Now it wouldn't be so bad if we could RP but we seem railroaded. We wanted to negotiate, combat. We wished to explore a city described as the jewel of the country, NOPE. Shopping!... you get a list of item when you go to a shop and get told yes or no if you can buy them of if they are in stock. Money? Nope, it's free. Taverns? Not a thing...

Our ex DM and I came to call his campaign Final Fantasy 13. 

we both made RP heavy characters, he's not made for combat yet we always fight! We try reasoning with the enemy, we don't speak their language! We try going off the beaten path ever so slightly and we are pushed back into it. We now recently had a message that we needed to go somehwere from big, powerful mages! If we stray off or don't make it in time, we'll be hunted, killed or brought to the mages. It's like the story plays itself and we are set pieces!

I had never seen our ex DM so... dead inside? He wasn't enjoying it and it was quite noticable. The character he has is a marvel, a jewel of douchebagery so amazing without being game or group braking. A truly well made neutral evil, selfish character much like Raphael in Soul Calibur. It played extremely well with someof the other characters as well! Yet the lack of role playing, the amazing but railroad-y story we want to see unfold has got us caught. We like the current DM, but we just aren't enjoying it. The newbies aren't comfortable fully with Pathfinder though that's something you learn with time really. Story wise they like it but the combat is getting heavier for them and they struggle a tad too much.  

As a DM, I see our curent one is not seeing the struggle, throwing NPCs that can cast cure serious wounds on us all the time when we have a cleric and a paladin on hand as well as I playing a helpful ranger. We shouldn't need more healing yet we always do. We are five player, two NPCs who hits like dumpster trucks on fire and can heal us. It shows to me that the encounter are unbalanced if we always need help! The fights last too long to be highlights of the night and the roleplaying is reduced to asking questions and being told a lot of really interesting exposition we can only think about exploring and playing through as characters yet seem like we never will.  

 With the COVID-19  We recently decided to play over Discord but I happen to be the temporary DM since I already ran Curse of Strahd in the past and I'm quite an RP heavy guy. The newbies and core group had a blast though it seems like our new friends really aren't use to the style change but quite like it. The core group for which I ran CoS already are loving it as it was their favorite campaign yet. (The book is just that good, pick a copy up if you're looking for something to play with pals during the isolation period.) 

Our curent DM (Not me.) Didn't join or seemed interested in playing over Discord his story or mine. We like him, he's fun to be around, great in combat, alright as a roleplayer with a great sense for story writing and just stories in general.  

This is just kind of a rant. Talk about anything you want in the comments, I just wanted to get this heavy ball off my shoulders. I've never seen a person crushed so bad before that playing a game they love became a chore and actually depressing rather than a fun time amongst friends meant to finish the week off on a high note.",6,1584942827,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnex09/problem_dm_is_ruining_our_enjoyment_of_the_game/,DnD,1

fnet08,THE_WIZARD_OF_PAWS,"The story, and the tenants, of the god Embrus.","You know how it is; you're roaming a grassland, trudging from point A to point B, when the DM calls for a perception check and your character notices some campfires in the distance. 


Khazat-tem is a scholar and a bit of a sorcerer, but he tends to try and use his wits and charm if able to get out of a situation. In this case, he decides to sneak up and see who it might be; maybe they're friendly, after all.


Unfortunately, ""stealth"" isn't a strong suit of our hero, and he is only barely able to make out forms among the fires when he's accosted with a ""Who goes there!?"" from the underbrush ahead.


""Uhhh... Embrus? The....Demi-god of fire.""


/Roll bluff.... Natural 20.


""Oh! Oh my I didn't know we'd be having any visitors from the gods tonight!"" A satyr comes out from behind a bush. ""Our tribal elder will want to meet you!""


Not long after I'm in the middle of camp, having to perform feats of fire magic (and with prestidigitation and minor illusion, plus a great bluff score and some awesome rolls, it's not that hard). A bit of a skill challenge later and I'm accepted as Embrus. The leader is still a little suspicious, and he asks a boon of me.


""Will you take out the harpy that's been hounding my people? She takes our sheep and I fear it's only a matter of time until she moves on to our young."" Well of course we will. We're nice people. And oh yeah that's easy for a god right?


Unknown to our party (let's be honest, the warlock and druid aren't important here, this whole session was the Embrus show) the elder sent a scout to watch 'his holyness' and determine once and for all how godly he is.


Khazat-tem happens to be a wild magic sorcerer, though... So what the scout saw was a god who summoned an elephant (accident), gained a third eye on his forehead (another whoops) and who fell from a cliff and was completely unharmed (very high athletic check to catch and crawl up from a small ledge below).



That evening, after a thoroughly-elephant-trampled harpy head was presented to the elder, I was asked to provide them the rules of the new religion.


I present them here.


The following are the major tenants of the religion of Embrus:


The flames which warm the Satyr tribes in the cold of winter and upon which food is made delicious are a sign of the love of the Lord Embrus, god of fire. Proper devotion to Embrus shall bring warmth &amp; plenty to your life; turn away from the Lord Embrus and you shall be cold and unhappiness shall plague you. The Tribe of Embrus will feel no chill so long as they do not turn from the Teachings of Embrus.


As the flames of the ash and the flames of the oak burn together to become a bonfire, so shall the tribes of the Satyr come together in the glory of Embrus. To bring the word of the Lord to your fellow Satyrs, and yea, even unto other intelligent species, shall increase the love Embrus has for you and he shall bless you for doing so. Fight not amongst yourselves, as the flames do not fight each other but instead join to become stronger. As the strength of the Tribes grow, so shall the love and protection of Embrus embrace the Tribes of Embrus.


The fires that live within man and woman are the gifts of Embrus; you are to embrace the fires as you embrace each other. Just as the flames shall expand from the tinder and ignite the campfire, so too shall the Peoples of Embrus increase and expand upon the world. The tinder does not feel jealous to a bough of ash that receives a lick of flame from another source; instead it revels in the radiated heat of their burning. So, too, shall the Peoples of Embrus not beget jealousy at the burning fires of others, but find harmony in the willing flames of another.


The Feast of Embrus shall be celebrated upon the Spring Equinox. Upon the day of the Feast, there shall be no work commenced besides that required for Feasting. Enough food shall be roasted upon the mighty Pyre of Embrus that all of the Nation of Embrus present there may be fed and fed once again. The Lord Embrus shall dance with you on this day, the Lord Embrus will love with you on this day, and the Lord Embrus will watch over the Nation of Embrus for the forthcoming season and ensure that the Nation does not come to harm.


To not celebrate the Feast of Embrus shall make Embrus turn his face from you. Your fires will burn cold, your inner lights will go out, and your meats will not cook when placed within the flames. Yet worry not, for Embrus is a forgiving lord, and a Week of Feast in the honor of Embrus shall bring his heat and love back to you.


The Nation of Embrus shall always revere the flame; within a village, a fire shall always burn so that any who is chilled may sit and be warmed by Embrus' love. When on the move, carry the flame of the people with you and use it to light the next fire. This will signify the love of Embrus as it beckons the Nation across the land.


¬†When a member of the Nation of Embrus has gone from the world, rejoice, for they have no worry and no struggle. Place their body upon a pyre and stand vigil while it burns; so shall the Lord Embrus take the spirit of the fallen and shepherd them to the next world. Fear not, for they shall feel no pain nor chill; instead, they will finally be able to laugh and dance in the great fires of the Pyres, as Lord Embrus himself does, and they shall be happy for ever.


When a people is not willing to accept the teachings of Embrus, the power of the Lord must be explained to them. You are to bring the power of Lord Embrus to these people in force, until such time as they see that there is no greater power than His. You will find that fires start more easily when they are used in this manner; set alight their false idols and their priests that spout falsehoods. The Power of Embrus shall be manifest and they will turn from their cold ways.


So says the Lord Embrus, God of Fire. So shall it be.


The satyr elder spent all night with Khazat-tem to carefully take all of this down on scrolls.


We will see where it goes from here.... Khazat-tem sees it as a wonderful opportunity to study the birth and growth of a cult.",1,1584942231,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnet08/the_story_and_the_tenants_of_the_god_embrus/,DnD,1

fnekuo,DJ_HorseLegs,Bard saves the plot from the wrath of Murderhobo That Guy.,"‚ÄúLawful Good‚Äù paladin decided to chase an innocent man into his home and trashed the place looking for him. He even broke the man‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs hip by tackling him over a kitchen counter. Once he found who was looking for, he attempted to kidnap him in broad daylight. The guards rush into the innocent mans house and our paladin was outnumbered him 5 to 1. 

For context, the rest of the party were all in the local tavern enjoying some Wild Magic Infused Ale made by the mysterious barkeeper that owns the place. 

Anyway, the paladin does the only logical thing and throws the hostage at the guards, knocking the 3 of them that were standing near the door onto their asses and runs out of the man‚Äôs house, running over the guards and injured man.

As everyone in our party were the only new people in town in over 30 years and part of some ancient prophecy, we were kind of a big deal. Literally everyone knew exactly who we were and where we were staying.

Me, being the bard with 18 charisma and having proficiency in everything you already imagine I would have, marched over to the crime scene immediately after finding out what happened. Following the trail of destruction left by our lawful stupid paladin, I find the same guards questioning the civilians and immediately roll a nat 20 on deception. 

Since the tavern in town serves that Wild Magic Infused Ale, I just blamed the paladin‚Äôs entire rampage on the crazy brew he was served. All the guards and even the injured hostage were like ‚ÄúOH THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE, NO HARD FEELINGS. CHARGES DROPPED, CASE CLOSED.‚Äù I even convinced the injured hostage to join us permanently as a sort of guide and translator.


Bards are great.

fnehxb,Pallorano,"Can you ever truly recover from terrible, personally impacting D&amp;D experiences?","At this point I don't think I can ever pick up a set of dice again. Long story short, the people who used to be my best friends spent years shitting on each other at the table and on my campaigns whenever I attempted to dungeon master, completely disrespecting all the effort and emotion I put in. After events have transpired and I've cut them out of my life, the few feeble attempts I've had at playing have all gone poorly due to immature players, and now I feel like I'm too scarred from terrible experiences to ever play this game again.  
  
D&amp;D used to be the coolest thing in the world, but now it's nothing but bad memories and sub-par experiences. Have any of you guys ever been able to move on from something like this and find joy in playing again if you happen to find a good group to join? I used to create characters and write campaigns in my free time just for fun, but now I can't imagine putting in the effort just for another potentially failed campaign.   
  
It's not just my drive to play D&amp;D that's been impacted, either. Just a few years ago I used to be huge into fantasy literature, but I now have trouble enjoying any fantasy-centric fiction.

fnef5z,Alphonse123,Any Ideas how to turn this bad boy into a PC?,"This is an experiment more than anything, but I was inspired to create this Figurine in Hero Forge after reading about a Faction in a Third-Party Module, *""Seas of Vodari""-* The Theocracy of Taevara: A Nation of religious zealots ruled by the Church, with the fist of it's vast fleet and mighty legions being Paladins and Clerics known as The Knights of Taeva. 

Taeva, according to the module, is the Goddess of Order, Justice, Law, War, and Civilization. Thus, I decided to make a Figure based on a wounded Knight of the Order- stricken of his sight, but blessed by his Patron God with Divine Power. But how would I best convert this Sea Faring Warrior of Light into a Character? What Class, Stats, Attributes, Background, and Gear would YOU use to create such a warrior?

fnectb,SpecificOceanGM,"Hello there, forever DM here.","What would you guys do in my situation? I have been a DM for about three years now, and this is one of the first times I'm getting to be a player. The current group is meeting every day, and has been for a few weeks now, we play on discord and we don't know eachother and have never met each other outside of this game. The party is level 7, and we have three bards, two sorcerers, a barb, a fighter, and a hexblade. 

Here is where things get bad, the DM is new. He doesn't know the rules well, and has trouble saying no. As a player, I'm trying to help him as much as I can, because I really think he can do well and I am enjoying the game. But our valor bard has been taking advantage of the DM. He asks for spells that bards don't get, he asked for his spellcast modifier to be strength instead of charisma, he asked for gear that he shouldn't be proficient in and for it to be +1 even for a tenth of the price it should be. 

The last straw was just a few minutes ago, he asked for a variant rule from the DMG. Or that he said was from it, I can't confirm that. He asked for Spell Points instead of Spell Slots, Me, the two Sorcerers, and the barbarian argued that it was OP or at the very  least threw off the balance. Everyone else said they were indifferent, the DM wanting to continue combat (Yes this guy prosperously did this during combat to make the DM feel rushed.) took a brief look at it, said he didn't know, and before he could say no the bard started fast talking him.   
""I use it in all my games, It makes things so much easier, everyone liked it, ect...""

The DM allowed it.  


I am honestly considering quitting the game just because of this player, I don't want to, but its so annoying. I am not willing to do what he is doing, and most of the party are with me, and when the Barb tried the Valor Bard convinced the DM that it would be overpowered and so unfair.

fndnd0,Shazam100,Mid-Air Teleportation Surprise,"So this is coming from my last session in which my players faced off against a Banderhobb. First, great enemy, definitely use if you get the chance. They really work great as a hag coven's bruiser. But! Make sure you use them more cleverly than I did.

The players were in a dark alley, so right in the creature's wheelhouse. They were freaking out from his teleports, but then they bunched up, and I realized my mistake in gifting a party with an aasimar a driftglobe: not very much darkness or dim light. By the end of the combat, I basically had the creature charge in like a berserker at them, since he couldn't teleport.

What I'm realizing now, though, is that there's nothing in its statblock that says he has to teleport *on the ground*. I very well could have had him teleport in mid air, falling directly between the pally and the rogue, since the radius of their combined light still left a spot of dim light above and between them. Alas, maybe next time.

This may not actually be RAW, and I wanted to get some opinions on this as well as inspire some other DMs in case it is feasible. Tell me what you all think.",0,1584936408,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fndnd0/midair_teleportation_surprise/,DnD,1
fndhup,Aarakokra,Opinion: The resource management and spell slots system of D&amp;D is one of the great parts of the game and we should keep it.,"I've noticed some people talking about how D&amp;D should use a mana system, where mana regenerates during combat, but spells are weaker, among similar systems. I think this is a terrible idea for several reasons, and here's why:

Most of us don't see D&amp;D as a pure combat game where you kill things, grab loot, sell it to buy better items, repeat. This is a legitimate style of play where I could see a mana system working well, but this is not how most of us play. Most of us want a good story, character interaction, problem-solving, etc. Things that are hard to achieve with that playstyle alone.

Having to manage resources like spell slots bridges the gap between combat and RP, because, let's say that you might need that spell slot later, or that you need to save that component, encouraging you to be smart about your decisions. If we used a mana system, you could just wait to cast a spell again, meaning that there's no need to think ""oh I might need to save this spell slot for later"".

When you decide to just take on a dungeon, healing from each encounter and moving on the fighting the next enemy with the same resources, it makes the game kind of flat, whereas having your various resources deplete and be hard to regain makes you want to think about trying to be creative so you can stretch out your resources. Perhaps a wizard might try luring an enemy into a trap instead of casting magic missile on it, saving a spell slot and getting into exciting shenanigans in order to lure the monster into the trap.

And, as mentioned, it works well for RP.

&amp;#x200B;

The same I think applies to the resource management aspect other than spell slots. Do you jump off the edge of the balcony, evading your enemy but injuring you, and it will take a while for you to heal, or just make you lose a heal potion/spell slot? Do you spend valuable gold on a magic item that will help you with this adventure, but become relatively useless afterwards? All of these questions make the dynamics of the game far more interesting.

This resource management aspect makes a variety of things feel really special. If you extend it to something like [survival D&amp;D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkHapG6kXUg), that aspect of the game practically becomes essential for that playstyle to be exciting.

When players are smart, creative, and resourceful about their actions, it makes the game more fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that's my perspective on it. Sorry it was a bit long.",55,1584935707,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fndhup/opinion_the_resource_management_and_spell_slots/,DnD,1

fncjg0,uniqueNewYorkYouKnow,The story of the Titanic Ape (5e),"Last session we basically had a megazord style battle, there was a giant creature of our DM's own design attacking a city in his homebrew world.

The city was the home of Raidriar, the infant God. Should the city fall, the next God would fall as well, and the world would be plunged into chaos. We, obviously, couldn't let that happen. There were four of us on this fateful day, four heroes who combined their might to save the world. Ayrena, the Eladrin Druid. Monthir, the shifter Barbarian. Gallen, the human sorcerer. And Teri, the Tabaxi Wizard. We had this plan brewing for months behind our DM's back, and we were so proud when we finally got to use it.

It started with me, the Barbarian. We have a rule that we can use things that cost a bonus action, as an action, so long as we forfeit our movement. I used my wildhunt shifter ability, and I raged. That was the start. Next, it was Ayrena. She casted Polymorph on me, and turned me into a giant gorilla. Teri then used haste on me, allowing me to move even further before. Gallen wasn't at the table yet, but we described it as he was doing important research. 

I rushed to attack. I made it there quickly, and thanks to my reckless attack ability, I was able to do a good chunk of damage to the creature that the DM simply described as Teka from Moana, only ice instead of lava. The fighting went on for what felt like forever, but was truly only 4 rounds of us trading blows, him doing half damage and me hardly scraping his healthbar. At fourth level I took the Tavern Brawler feat, in anticipation for this moment. I tore a building out of the ground and wielded like a weapon, beating the beast down. 

The DM described this next part as something and I'm unsure as to what he meant. He said that the creature had opened ""his eighth gate""? Which I'm assuming is basically Super Saiyan. Anyway, I got knocked prone. This was where Gallen got the table, and here's where things got interesting. He used a quickened spell to teleport to me (I'm unsure what spell it was, I think it was dimension door however) and then twin casted Enlarge/Reduce on both me and the building I was using as a weapon. Normally for Enlarge/Reduce, the weapon only does 1d4 extra damage, but the DM felt that using an entire building up a size for a d4 was weak, so he gave me something I never would have expected. 4d6. I did an extra 4d6 damage with that weapon. 

The rest of the fight was a slaughter fest. I rolled nat20's for every attack I did that round, and I ended the conflict by breaking the building across the creature, and then stabbing both sides of the broken building inside of of the beast, ripping it in half. It was glorious, and according to my DM, the city is in the process of building a statue in our honor. 

This is an amazing event and I really want to see more ways we could have done this, with different creatures/enemies.",0,1584931442,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fncjg0/the_story_of_the_titanic_ape_5e/,DnD,1

fnbpt3,That0neTrumpet,"Bad guy wants to destroy the world, player is convinced to help him. HELP. (Dragon Aged themed DND campaign)","So, to give context here's the main cast of the campaign right now.

* \*Etna - Grey Warden elven Shadow Sorcerer. Very close to Velinn, almost like brothers. Against Solas.
* \*Velinn - Dalish elf who was willingly possessed by a spirit of Valor in his backstory. Brother of Meri and like a brother to Etna.
* \*Ranger Wolf - Former member of the inquisition. Good at giving life advice, also a ranger.
* Morrigan - A character from the games. She's not that close to the party at the moment.
* Cullen - A character from the games. Views Etna like a son, and Meri almost like a daughter.
* Varric - The cool one. Dwarf rogue, everyone loves him.
* Meri - Younger sister of Velinn. They're both very close. She was abducted and died a horrible death recently (the whole thing was planned by me, she was going to turn into a darkspawn called a Broodmother and the process is pretty messed up) and they had the funeral session today. She died in the process of becoming a Grey Warden (the only cure for the Blight).
* Solas - the main villain. He's also called Fen'Harel/The Dread Wolf. He wants to save the elves and restore the world he once destroyed. However, this also means that the current world has to be destroyed. Crazy, I know.

\*player character

I‚Äôm DMing a homebrew Dragon Age campaign based on what the next game might be. The main villain, Solas has been gaining power and the party is slowly working to stop him. He‚Äôs made many regular appearances so far in the campaign. Recently, after Meri caught the Blight, Solas gave the party the ingredients for the cure (50/50 chance of survival). It didn't work, but it's the thought that counts.

Recently, he approached \*Velinn and asked for his help with tearing down the veil (if you know dragon age, you know what I mean). Now, I was fully expecting him to either decline or even attempt to kill him. But, to my surprise as well as my co-DM‚Äôs, he said yes. He AGREED to help this man end the world in order to save the elves. Now, as a DM I understand this might happen often, but I‚Äôve never seen it happen before. Not to mention this party‚Äôs pretty tight. Like, the characters consider each other family.

There are a ton of possibilities here that I have to look at now, even though I have the basic framework for the campaign already (stopping a civil war, finding artifacts before the main villain, stopping the main villain, failing to stop him, seeing the fallout, recovering and restoring what was destroyed). They're heading to stop the civil war between a faction known as the grey wardens (the whole civil war was caused by Solas).

There is more to it than just this, so if anyone's willing to give more help than just a comment we can talk over Discord. I'd prefer that anyone I talk to is at least a little familiar with Dragon Age's lore.

fnaybm,Ammoth,[DMing] Advice on improving my system for gathering resources?,"Hey y'all!   
   
So I'm running a homebrew campaign and one of my players has recently taken a great interest in herbalism and potion-making. I have developed a relatively simple system for her to craft various potions that I have written recipes for, the catch being that she must forage for most of these ingredients (or try and find a merchant who has those ingredients on hand). My problem today is that I ran into the first instance of her really wanting to go out and search for ingredients (for various reasons she hasn't needed to forage for any ingredients until now).    
Basically, I have broken down ingredients into various rarities and determined which ingredients can be harvested and what must be done to harvest them. For example, common ingredients require a DC Nature/Survival check and uncommon require a DC 15 check. Anything rare or higher is very specific items (ie the heart of an elemental) and must either be hunted or bought. The main issue I am running into now is how to go about performing the checks that my players make when they are scavenging for common/uncommon ingredients. During our session today I simply made her make a check for each hour she spent searching. Doing some quick math, if players sleep for 8 hours, travel for 8 hours, and spend a total of 2 hours setting up and breaking down camp, players have essentially 6 hours of free time a day. My player decided she wanted to spend every hour of free time she had on a 4-day journey searching for ingredients, meaning she wanted to spend 24 total hours scavenging. I had no problem with this, but it did seem a little excessive to make her roll that many checks. This is also because I then had to roll on my ingredient table to see what she found.     
So now I'm just reaching out to the community to see if there is anyone else out there who may use a homebrew scavenging system and could offer some helpful tips on how to make my system better. I'm thinking of making her be required to tell me what specific item she is looking for (at least for uncommon) as well as making her tell me preemptively how many hours she wants to search and then make her do a single roll for the whole day. Any thoughts would be helpful, and thank you in advance!",2,1584924934,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnaybm/dming_advice_on_improving_my_system_for_gathering/,DnD,1

fnapwr,GydeonRL,Tips for DMing long periods of travel?,"I've been playing 5E for a while but not DMing for too long, and i'm the kind of DM- nay, person- who likes to way over-prepare. I take great joy in working on complex new features and extra elements to spice up the gameplay. For example, I like creating multiple maps for single sessions, many different ways a certain encounter could go, many items or possible encounters that the party could find depending on what I think best, etc, because I know that if I only plan one option it WON'T be the end result- and that I will be unsatisfied with my level of preparedness as the situation unfolds in whatever weird way it does. This works pretty well for me in terms of creating interesting or unique situations, but falls apart completely during travel. Normally, the easiest thing to do is tell the party that they've been traveling for a week and reached their destination without event, but i'm currently doing a campaign where most of the game will be travelling towards the end destination. What kinds of encounters and such could I add to increase interest in these parts, and extend the campaign length? I'm thinking overall ideas beyond just throwing random creatures and npcs. What have you done in your games?

However, one thing came up that I wanted to query the Elder Brain about. Namely: how the hell do I keep a gungho Aarakocra alive? They're a rogue basically playing a magpie. We had one encounter tonight and she basically dive-bombed the 3 goblins. Because of her higher movement speed, there wasn't much I could do to hold her back, except leverage angle of approach to increase her distance to cover so she wasn't a whole round ahead without support.

It all ended fine, but I can see this being an issue for a 6hp glasscannon. All but one player are totally new, so trying to let them explore limits. Already made it clear flying in combat isn't all sunshine and roses, but the speed difference and character personality look like they might become a problem if I can't find good ways to help shape things while mechanics are learned.

fnacjt,Ciaran_y00,New DM and just played my favourite session so far!,"Hi guys, just wanted to share my experience so far. 

I've been playing irregularly for maybe 4 years, and had never DMed before. Myself and my group all live abroad from home, and our DM left maybe August last year. I inherited the books in a way from him as they couldn't fit in his luggage, but only started to try and DM my first game in January. We've only managed three sessions of Lost Mine of Phandelver so far with one new player and two who have played a little before. 

It's been going well, but I didn't feel like I really hit my stride or had a good grasp of the DM role until Saturday night. We picked up right before the Nothic in Redbrand Hideout, and the Ranger decides to split from the rest of the group, sneak through into the wizards workshop, where Glasstaff was waiting for him. He somehow deceived our ranger, posturing to make himself an ally, and then using his shocking grasp to create an opportunity to incapacitate him.

While this happened, the other two party members had stumbled into Droop and the three bugbears. They ALMOST made it, but were knocked unconscious.

I was a little bit thrown by this as I hadn't planned for that outcome- thinking on my feet I pulled the Cragmaw Castle map out, told them that Iarno and the Bugbears had made them prisoners and basically just ran the castle backwards. They started in the Owlbear room, went on to fight King Grol, saved Gundren, and escaped relatively unscathed. I like to think that this was the point where my Ranger learned how important it is to stick together. 

I honestly didn't expect them to survive the prison break-escort mission, but they have done the unexpected. I'm very excited to continue in two weeks with the side quest content now available in Phandalin- they sound eager to go to and explore Thundertree and kill the orcs at Wyvern Tor. I'm most excited for Thundertree as it will set the stage for our campaign after Wave Echo Cave has been completed. 

I just wanted to share this with someone as I don't really have anyone else to talk to about the DM side of the game!",0,1584922595,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fnacjt/new_dm_and_just_played_my_favourite_session_so_far/,DnD,1

At only level 7, he could deal 50+ damage every turn with all of the magical artifacts he had found. We were in combat with a military general, who was giving us trouble lately. We were on the edge of a cliff in a cavern, Jaxt decided to tackle the general off the cliff and use him for cushion from the fall, plus with Slow Fall, i wasn't worried he would get too hurt. I successfully tackle the guy, and we both fall, i fail my grapple check, but right before we hit the bottom i grab him and land safely with only like 15 damage on me and the general is dead. Crap! I have no way of getting up, why didn't i think of that. We were in a mine, and i found a large drill attached to metal rods, i yell at the parties Arcane Archer to press the ""UP"" button on the drills control panel above the cliff. I climb up unto the drill, trying to ride it elevator style. The Archer gets i Nat 1 on his INT check to find the up button, so he presses the ""DOWN button."" My character loses his balance and is holding on for dear life, the active drill mowing into the cavern floor, i hoist myself up, but the heat from the drill kicks in, burning me, i fail my DEX save and it time for death saves. 8, 4, 10 and a Nat 1.

They spoke with the priest about the bones but it was late, so after knowing this they decided to deal with it in the morning. They are all level 3, and one of them decided to be a horizon walker.

Now, they haven't heard in depth of WHAT Barovia is, jusdt that they can't leave and it part of a different plane of existence than what they are used to. I feel bad for making half of the horizon walkers skills not usable for lore purposes, but It is necessary (I think). Thet don't know that should are trapped in barovia and that it is in a demi plane, although I gave many hints (we are all new).

Is there a way to go halfway with the horizon walker without making his path dull but also stay true to the lore? 

Rictavio is strahds enemy and they already suspect him to be related to the card. Is this encounter too early? The reveal too early?

fna15l,LunarianCecil,Thoughts on my Paladin build?,"Heres just a little info regarding my character before i get into the class choices.

**Name:**Alduin Frostscale

**[Stats]**

**Strength:** 17

**Dexterity:** 14

**Constitution:** 14

**Intelligence:** 11

**Wisdome:** 10

**Charisma:** 20

This wasy very first DnD character that i made towards the end of last year, before i really knew much about dnd. 

My first 5 levels i went into Paladin (Oath of Devotion), as i was originally just planning on going pure paladin. But as i learned more about DnD and how things worked i decided to multiclass.

So then my next 3 levels went into Bard (College of Valor) because i wanted to make him more supportive.

Our last session i actually ended up dying, i failed my first death save, and then my next death save i rolled a **1** and ***Crit Failed!** the death was somewhat unintentionally as we were fighting a monster that was meant to be unwinnable, and then we got resurrected. That session ended with us gaining a level.

And i had the idea to take warlock, pact of the celestial. And talked it over with my DM, cause i had the idea that Alduins brush with death brought him before his God Bahamut, but rather then Bahamut himself it was a different dragon of the Radiant nature that acted almost as a Judge on behalf of Bahamut. Alduin promised and pleaded to this Dragon of Judgement that ""If he let him have a second chance at life then he would provide Bahamut with even greater acts of devotion, and would convert even more people over to Bahamut.""

This Judgement Dragon, seeing the passion and desire in Alduins eyes, as well as looking into his Heart and saw that he really meant it and had honest truth and desire to make Bahamut even prouder, was allowed to grant Alduin a second chance at life, but by making a pact with this Judge Dragon/Bahamut.

And the way our campaign and party sees warlocks is the stereotypical ""sold your soul"" sort of thing, so rather then saying Alduin sold his soul to Bahamut and his Judgement Dragon we reflavored it as Alduin Devoted his entire soul to honor of Bahamut.


So the final build im planning on going with is...

Paladin 5/Bard 3/Warlock 12

Theres nothing else from paladin that i really care about or need, same with bard im pretty fine with just the inspiration and inspiration boos from college of valor. But going 12 into Warlock (Celestial) makes the most sense for me and the direction im taking him down.",2,1584921407,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fna15l/thoughts_on_my_paladin_build/,DnD,1

fn9wf9,Scottydawg321,My players faced their first campaign deaths; and they went out in the most spectacular fashion.,"I a DMing a campaign for five of my friends and today was the most exciting session I have ever ran.

Characters:

Me: the DM

Ember: A Fire Genasi Fighter

Tricho: An  Aarakocra Rouge

Garrison: A Warforged Paladin

Waldo: A Tiefling Cleric 

Mitzi: An Aarakocra  Druid

Reynard: A Arch-Fey Fey Lord from the Creature Codex

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

The campaign has been going on for a few months now and the PCs were becoming very close friends.

After going to the capital city they witnessed the execution of a group of terrorists and were forced to escape after the government would be arresting tieflings and other rare races. One of the party members, Tricho decided to watch the execution up close and was captured. 

The party decided to find and save their avian friend.

After traveling they found themselves in the Feywilds due to a trickster fey that transported them into it. 

They met a myconid named Dax. He lead them to the the Shadow Fey, who agreed to help save their friend in exchange for securing a Orb that the party had seen in their visions in the past and allowing the Shadow Fey to gain possession of it. They also told the party the location of Tricho.

The group embarked and managed to save Tricho after a tough fight with the guards of the prison camp. 

Garrison then decided to save other prisoners who were with Tricho with the Help of Waldo while the others made their escape.  Garrison and Waldo managed to free the five prisoners but were attacked by a mysterious void creature who killed all of the prisoners except for one.  They escaped using a Griffon Statute 

After getting to safety Garrison promptly said he was going back because it was a part of his Oath to do so. The party pleaded with him not to go and I warned the player that Garrison would most likely die if he did.

Garrison stood strong and told the party he was going to die trying to save the rest of the camp. Waldo tried to cast Command on Garrison but failed.  Tricho told Garrison the orb could kill people on the spot but he had made his choice.

Tricho, who was covered in scars from the camp told Garrison he would come with him because he knew the layout of the camp.

Ember, Waldo and Mitzi said their goodbyes and gave them what blessings they could as they took off towards the Shadow Fey to get more help. 

Garrison and Tricho rolled very well on their stealth checks and managed to get super close to the orb before the alarm went off.

Together the two  charged the orb. 

Tricho tried to fly but was grabbed and brought back down. 

The battle begins as Garrison and Tricho push through countless guards. The orb pulses and begins to drain the life of the two heroes.

Tricho goes down a few times but is brought back to life by Garrison. The two make it to the very large orb and Garrison rolls high enough that he actually picks it up as tricho begins to hit it with his dagger.

Tricho manages to shatter the orb after a few moments and the blast knocks him out. Garrison revives Tricho and smiles knowing that his friends is alive but is obliterated by a volley of spells and arrows.

Tricho realizing that the prisoners are free flies into the sky and begins to shout directions of how to get out saving hundreds of lives. Most escape and others riot as another volley hits Tricho causing him to fall to the ground. 

The enemy surround the two fallen heroes and  kill them.

Garrison goes to Mount Celestia for his heroic actions and will spend eternity fighting evil.

Tricho goes to the Beastlands where he can drink and tell stories for entirety. 

Garrison still finds time to visit Tricho and share a drink.

After learning of their deaths Waldo swears allegiance  to the Arch-Fey in return for power and an army to wipe out the owners of the camp.

I need to be there for the sessions - they won't run them without everyone there - most of the time. And I feel they get mad at me when I flake out or leave early. They think I'm the one of the group that ""doesn't put enough effort in"" or ""fucks over everyone else"" with my bs. I get yelled at for not knowing the rules as well as everyone else, and for taking my turns slower than everyone else, and for not knowing the storyline as much as everyone else who is more devoted to it than me.

But I don't want to offend anyone by saying ""I'm only okay with one session a week"" because our DM is fantastic and devotes a *shit ton* of time and energy and materials into making an epic campaign and world for us to play in.

I read about all you guys having shitty groups and wish one of you guys could take my place. You guys would love this group and enjoy it more than I would. I guess I just don't enjoy dnd as much as everyone else does for some reason. I have severe social anxiety so going out is hard enough, and sitting around the table with other people beats the shit out of me most days. 

We've been doing this for like 3 years now but this discrepency is really starting to fuel a lot of negative energy around us. They're mad at me for not trying and I'm mad at myself for not trying and mad at them for forcing me to try harder when I don't want to.

I can't force them to only meet up once a week. I also don't want to be the only guy who doesn't show up to sessions. Plus this game *fucks you* if you don't show. DnD gives you penalties in the form of you *not getting XP* if you don't make sessions so I would be like half the level everyone else is. It was like that for last years campaign and it *sucked* and I got fuckin *grilled* for it. (""If you wanna do more damage, you should attend more sessions, it's your fault...""). Having a lower-levelled character fucks over the group because you can't keep up in combat. I already get flak for not making optimal character levelling choices because I'm responsible for other players getting downed due to my ineptitude. 

I consider just leaving the campaign but these are my only friends and I would miss out on hanging with them. Another one of my friends never joined, and we just never see him anymore because he's never at the sessions, and that's where we all hang out.

What do you guys suggest? Just talking to them about it is going to be a shitshow. I'd rather not be *that guy*.",7,1584918204,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn96yc/advice_dnd_group_meets_up_too_often/,DnD,1

I decided to base my project on the character creation process for 5e, so I‚Äôm calling on the D&amp;D community for assistance. The only requirements to participate in the study is that you be 18 years or older and have some experience playing 5e.

All that‚Äôs needed is to click the link at the bottom of the post which will take you to the QualtricsXM website, where you can begin the survey which will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete.

It‚Äôs preferred that participants answer all the questions, but if you feel uncomfortable answering any of the questions, you can choose to skip them if you want, or go back and change your answer if you wish. Additionally you can close out of the survey at any time. If you have any concerns about the survey my institutional email is located near the bottom of the of participation agreement, which will be the first part of the survey.

Pact of the Dead Hand

One of your hand's flesh rots away leaving behind only a skeleton. This hand can be detached and reattached from your body without issue. It can also act independently while unattached and will follow the last command it received to the best of its ability until it receives another. This hand is referred to as the Dead Hand and uses the same statistics as a crawling claw except it has an intelligence of eight. You are always aware of its location and condition as long as it's on the same plane of existence. As a bonus action, you can telepathically command the hand to take an action or give it basic commands like, ""follow that person."" As an action, you can perceive thought the hand's senses and/or assume direct control of it, but your body must remain inanimate for as long as you are in direct control. The bones of the hand are magical and cannot be harmed by non-magical means. If the hand is destroyed you can retrieve the bones, and reassemble it over the course of one minute. If the bones of the hand are completely destroyed, in order to regain it you can perform an hour-long ritual to recreate it.

The hand can also phase in and out of the ethereal plane at will, and take with it anything small enough to fit in its palm. What are some interesting wats to use it?",4,1584914402,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn852t/5e_im_a_warlock_with_a_detachable_skeleton_hand/,DnD,1

I myself have trouble visualizing hundreds, sometimes thousands of coins in a pile, chest, sack, etc. My players have even less of a grasp of this concept then I do (for obvious reasons).

At my (virtual) table we do adhere to coin weight and recently I learned that 4/5 of my PCs carry *all* of their wealth on them (no bag of holding to trivialize this yet). One PC was wondering why she was almost at Max load when she remembered that she had almost 60lb of coin on her! 


So yea, as a dimensional space for then is far away and I do want them to keep track of where certain items are (for plot reasons in my adventure, having then leave coin places also influences them to leave other stuff places), I would like to better understand what would carrying 60lb worth of coin would look like, and what kind of containers would be needed for these things.


I'm sure someone, somewhere has had the same question and likely found something, would appreciate some sharing!

I established an introductory story with goblins of course for my new level 1 players. They ended up picking up on what their characters can do very fast, slaughtering everything I have thrown at them, and now they're about to enter the main goblin base inside a mountain. I kept it very vague and have suggested that it isn't just goblins, but rather something stronger in there that basically enslaved them. I had put a hill giant with goblin archers on top of him outside when I realized that my pre-planned supposedly deadly encounter was going to be absolutely nothing to them. Then they slaughtered him too. Tank with his protector ability, druids free temp HP, and rogue's dumb damage (opened with a crit sneak attack too. Right off the bat, took a third of giants health). 

Little extra background info: there's an evil divination wizard in his tower in the middle of all the other bad guys, but they're not together. Players sorta came here to clear out the mess around his tower for him. Didn't bother to ask why a supposedly very powerful wizard needs their help. They think he's stronger than he is. The only thing he ever did in front of them was cast an illusion that they know was an illusion. 

Now I need to come up with a boss for them to fight, figure out how long they should be in this mountain thing for (I was thinking 2-3 sessions worth cause my players FINALLY started giving me their backstories and I wanna get to those without making the thing they've been building up to completely insignificant), and figure out how to throw interesting encounters at them while still having the creatures make sense.

So I just started thinking about a video I watched, waaaay back in the dim early times of youtube.

The jist of the animated cartoon is that there is a group of players, one is definitely a monster of some kind, reminds me of the big Spawn monster (his name may be Gary). They are ridiculous and he constantly wants to cast some sort of light spell, and the DM gets frustrated enough to let him do it. One of the players (maybe Gary) also goes to the kitchen at some point possibly to get soda or snacks. He asks the others if they want anything. People are mad throughout the skit.

I desperately would like to track it down, but have no idea which keywords to find. I first found this video while playing vanilla WoW, watching leeroy jenkins, the numa numa song, badger badger etc.this dates it I think to circa 2005.

This time around, I'm doing my favorite weapon from Bloodborne, this bad boy: [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9a/a0/08/9aa008bb081844ce7436698705f24fc6.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9a/a0/08/9aa008bb081844ce7436698705f24fc6.jpg)

**Thousand Views / Blood Shadow**

You gain a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this Magic Weapon, which consists of a shortsword or katana and its scabbard. Attempting to attune to the weapon without the scabbard reveals to the attuner that doing so is impossible. When attuning to this weapon, a pair of runes depicting the weapon‚Äôs name, ‚ÄòThousand Views‚Äô, are etched into the wielder‚Äôs mind. When its special property is activated for the first time, the weapon's curse takes effect and these runes separate, revealing the weapon‚Äôs true name: ‚ÄòBlood Shadow‚Äô. (Note: information about the curse is not revealed to the wielder during attunement.)

As a bonus action on your turn, you may coat the blade in blood-like viscera by sheathing it, then drawing it from its scabbard, which is irrevocably linked to your life force during the attunement process-- while the weapon is in this state, your melee attacks made with the weapon deal a number of d6 in Acid damage equal to your proficiency bonus, in addition to the weapon‚Äôs base damage. At the end of each of your turns while this effect is active, you take the same number (proficiency bonus) of d4 in Necrotic damage. You can use a bonus action to deactivate this property of the weapon. This property cannot be triggered without the scabbard, and if you lose it, the sword wills you to find its mate as your top priority at all times until it is located.

**Curse.** This cursed weapon craves the blood of humanoids; its wielder is compelled to kill and draw blood from their enemies with the sword, and make enemies if they have none-- when interacting with a potentially-hostile (subject to DM discretion) neutral humanoid, make a Wis saving throw against a DC of 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, you must attempt to intimidate or otherwise antagonize that humanoid into fighting you; on a critical failure, you cannot resist the sword‚Äôs bloodlust and must attack them with the weapon.¬†The more blood drawn by the sword, the greater the wielder's feelings of gratification, but the weapon's bloodthirst can never be fully satiated.",4,1584910485,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn70xr/chikage_from_bloodborne_custom_magic_weapon_for_5e/,DnD,1

I play a barbarian in DnD and my buddy plays as a Paladin.  We fought in an arena battle for glory and treasure.

During the right, I raged and he used the spell: Command.  I understand that if I don't make the saving throw I must do what he said (the 1 word like surrender or run away).

My question is that if I'm raging I can't concentrate why can I focus on what my opponent is saying and then listen to him and try to make a save?

Maybe I'm missing something but I think if I'm in such a rage that I can't concentrate to use spells (aka magic) then how can I concentrate enough on my enemy and what he's saying to make a saving throw on that?  I may be completely in the wrong and I'm fine with that.  I just want to know if I am or not.

fn6ohu,demus234,Creating characters help,"I'm new to dnd and am still looking for people to play with I only know the basics. 

The backstory/history of the character

. I thought of a cool character and his history. He is a rouge that was born in a dark and gloomy kingdom that worships the world serpent (something like jormogundar from norse myth) their sacred animals are snakes serpents and basilisks. My character was taken in by worshipers of the serpent because his parents were killed possibly by the worshipers because they saw his potential. He was taught by the worshipers to be a deadly assassin he usually went and took innocent people so they could be sacrificed (they belived every sacrifice made the serpent bigger and eventually it would be big enough to destroy the world but it would create a new world for its worshiper) one day he had a moral dilemma, he questioned his elders and the ways of their religion. So one day he decided to leave the kingdom with his pet snake that he cared about since it was given to him bye the worshipers when he was very young. Now to make up for the bad he has done he vowed to never kill the innocent and only punish the evil people of the world.

The thing I want to know is if I can create a rouge that always has his snake with him he uses the snake to kill his targets. I'm new to dnd and I thought of this character but don't know if I can create him because of the snake.

fn6mcf,Moses_The_Wise,Visions of the Past Uses,"The 17th level Knowledge Cleric feature Visions of the Past seems pretty...niche, to say the least. It might also be a little underpowered, and I can only think of a small handful of uses for it. For reference: 

&gt; Visions of the Past

&gt; Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation and prayer, then receive dreamlike, shadowy glimpses of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and must maintain concentration during that time, as if you were casting a spell.

&gt; Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

&gt; Object Reading.¬†

&gt; Holding an object as you meditate, you can see visions of the object's previous owner. After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner. If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute for each owner to learn the same information about that creature.

&gt; Area Reading.¬†

&gt; As you meditate, you see visions of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube), going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important in your current situation.


Have you ever seen cool, useful ways this feature had been used? Can you think of some? Me an my SO thought of: 

- Finding recently set/activated traps 

- Answers to puzzles in recently travelled areas 

- Seeing if someone you're chasing has been there recently

- Solving murders

- Finding out about a new item",1,1584909053,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn6mcf/visions_of_the_past_uses/,DnD,1
fn6m16,CabooseEFGF,1st campaign and because of my DM I am hooked!,"During our session tonight, I took a risk and it paid off! I really have to hand it to our DM for making it such a fun session!

TLDR: I hugged an enemy and it died.

Full version: 
So a bit of backstory, I am a 3' 1"" Chaotic Neutral Halfling Rogue. We made our way to a monastery which ended up being abandoned except for a few hags. We were able to kill the hags that had come to occupy the monastery. As we searched the abandoned building we found out that the monastery was for a Goddes of Love and Friendship. There was a place of worship upstairs with a statue that looked very welcoming along with pews for parishioners.

We didnt see anything in the monastery itself and eventually we made our way into the basement. As we were looking around we found a second goddess statue, but there was a note on the altar in front of the statue. The note saying that monastery was built for the goddess while it started good, they had a false goddess impersonating the actual goddes. The fraud ended up getting all the followers to punish people who refused to follow her at first, but over time it escalated to torture and in some cases ended up in kiling in the name of the love/friendship goddess. They realized this too late. Eventually the real goddess came in and punished all the followers because of what they did. 

As we were listening to one of the PC's reading the note out loud, we heard footsteps coming. As a reaction I cast disguise self and made myself into the goddess and held out my hands (like praise the sun lol). Right in front of the second statue we found. The monster appeared as a black humanoid figure. When it came in the room it first saw our Paladin PC. So it began to make Its way to her but I said ""I command thee to stop"" (thinking it would listen since I looked like a mini goddess)... It heard me but instead of stopping it ended up turning to me and started slowly to make it's way to me. I kept my hands up but So our Tabaxi PC grabbed me and ran off with me.
 
Eventually I was able to get free from his grasp. The monster was still pursuing us as we were trying to find our way out of the basement as we ran in the wrong direction and ended up deeper into the basement. Slowly the monster came... remembering the note that was left, Instead of fighting, I put my swords down in front of the monster and walked up to it and gave it a hug (Hoping it was the punishment that the real goddess sent. My heart was racing because It was either gonna work or I was gonna die).  Turns out the hug worked and the creature died. As the blackness faded it turns out it was full of loot and a skeleton.

After we left and during the night the part ended up dreaming, and turns out the monster was one of the people who got tortured. His family was killed by these fanatics, and his life was in ruin as he basically just drank away his problems. Eventually the fanatical came for him and tortured him. He slowly became the monster and killed everyone and then stayed and protected the monastery. It was actually a super sad and depressing dream about him.  But at the end of the dream it was me hugging him and him feeling at peace with himself , and because of this, he passed on.

Below is what i have so far:

Mal Drah Gathakanathi the Small was a little short as a child in the tribe, hence the nickname. As a Goliath, he is always working to prove his worth and craves fair competition. During his early teens he was sent on a traditional hunt to prove that he was ready to enter the village as an adult. He was gone for a few weeks tracking a young Roc, and using his spear and waiting for the roc to return to its nest, he brought the beast down. However, when he returned to his village, he discovered his tribe had been slaughtered by orcs that also lived in the mountains..

Mal Drah was forced to live in the mountains alone for several years. When the orc tribe started expanding and claiming more territory, Mal Drah was forced out of the mountains and into civilization, where he couldn't hunt for every meal, everything was too small for him, and he was seen as a brute instead of a individual.",2,1584907150,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn624k/mal_drah_gathakanathi_the_small/,DnD,1

For the better part of three years, I have been working on a system to implement into D&amp;D for a campaign I called the Campaign of Chaos! which is misspelled without the exclamation point.

The system works in general by allowing every class to cause whatever to happen at whatever time. I read through the big list of 10,000 random effects online and was disappointed that so many boiled down to ‚Äúeveryone dies and you literally can do nothing about it,‚Äù or ‚Äúyou die and nothing you do can change it.‚Äù So, I wrote a list of 1000 effects that are all immediately survivable and there fore can be stapled to any campaign.

I also included a system of using this table, so anyone can use it at anytime.

With permission for the mods of r/DnD, I am willing to distribute this list to anyone who would like to use it. If you want a copy of this list, message me and we can agree on a way to send it to you. The only thing I ask in return is feedback on how it worked out for you and that you credit me for creating it if anyone asks.",0,1584903657,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn50n5/completed_probability_failure_table_and_how_to/,DnD,1

Therefore I am unfamiliar with what resources are out there to get a strong digital campaign going and was hoping you wonderful folk might be able to help me.

Be it apps, software, or just handy digital guides, please let me know what is out there so I can make this the best experience possible for everyone involved. 

Best wishes and stay well! Thank you so much!",4,1584899962,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn3w8z/resources_for_digital_only_campaign/,DnD,1

fn3iql,Wasen_Aeon,My First Campaign,"Last week me and my friends finished a campaign of Curse of Strahd that we had done almost weekly for about one and a half years now. Being a DM for the first time outside of a simple one-shots, it was quite the undertaking and although I still have a lot to work on, I'm glad that my friends actually had a lot of fun and encouraged each other as we're all are pretty much newbies overall.

Since the players and I are all living in different places, we decided to use Roll20 as the base of operations for our campaign and I'm glad that the site is doing a lot of preset when buying the campaign through their service as it saved me from a lot of headaches from getting stuff ready. I did do some personal changes that I felt would fit better with my narrative as the maps themselves have a lot of rooms with barely anything in them and thus I did move around some stuff and created some stuff as well (for example, a chimera that the Abbott experienced on to create the mongrelfolks.)

This adventure had a lot of funny moments, everything from the fight of who'll get to use the Sunsword, the discussion of the most practical use of using a Battleaxe against simple wooden doors, the bard getting drunk at the taverns and many more moments of sillyness.

The picture itself is made by one of the players of the characters that took part of the party. From left to right we have:  
Beaumont: Our sneaky bard and treasure looter. Wine drinker connoiseuer and charming smooth-talker.  
Krasus: Our healing paladin and guiding light for the rest of the party.  
Acer: Our lucky gnome ranger who's bow is not to be understimated.  
Emma: Our Half-Elf ranger who's a friend to all animals with her pseudodragon companion Mimmi.  
Nevari: Our tiefling rogue whom with a warm heart can deal devastating hit from behind.

At the end of it all, I feel that we all of the party have grown with a better understanding of D&amp;D and had a lot of doing hanging out a few hours every week. I have several plans to build on a new campaign and who knows, maybe this will come ot a fruition as well :)",0,1584898677,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fn3iql/my_first_campaign/,DnD,1

fn3en1,FeyRhythmAiden,When Is a Story *TOO* Complicated?,"Hi all,

So for some explanation, I‚Äôm tryin to make dungeons based around the Zodiac, and for my Earth temple, I‚Äôve got to incorporate the Earth signs: Virgo (The Maiden), Capricorn (The Sea Goat), and Taurus (The Bull). Here‚Äôs what I came up with:

The setting is a stone castle in the middle of a forest that‚Äôs been there for so long it‚Äôs falling apart (I took from Nier Automata for inspiration). 
Within this castle, there are traps around every corner and clay golems (severely nerfed) to stop anyone from coming in. 
The Bull is a massive maddened creature that protects the outside of the castle and can only die once its master, the Maiden, is dead. 
The Maiden, originally the queen of this castle, is being kept in a dungeon. 
The Sea Goat, who was her court wizard, has taken over and put her there. He disguised himself as her so that the Clay Golems would follow his orders after he trapped her. 
The reason the Sea Goat imprisoned her was because she was going mad of loneliness and continuously luring adventurers only to trap them and keep them in this castle with her forever until they inevitably died of age, and the Sea Goat couldn‚Äôt bare to let it go on any longer.
Now, at present, she is trying to lure adventurers in so they will free her, she can kill the Sea Goat and reclaim her castle, and she can trap her rescuers there forever, too.

My question is: is this background for a dungeon too complicated? It‚Äôs going to dictate the order of events in the dungeon and I‚Äôm starting to worry it‚Äôll be hard to follow this story.

In my group 2 people only have iPads /iPhone so we gonna use face book messenger and a dice rolling chat room. 

Before you post up questions about what system is better. It might be worth considering what all the group members can do?  At very basic a small voice chat and an honest dm could work with most groups.

This isn‚Äôt a gripe at our community but more a thought on what is necessary at a time where internet bandwidth might be in short supply?

Party is level 3 on an early quest. We get to the boss fight. A Druid that can control thousands of rats  and transform into a large bear. Everyone else took out swarms while I, the ya my fighter, single-handedly wore down and executed the boss. As no swarms has been defeated, I planned to burn down the building and kill them all with one blow.

Here‚Äôs where it gets crazy.

I don‚Äôt want to burn the boss loot, so I action surge to search the body.
Nat 20.

‚Äî but to things there. My turn is over.
DM : ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for trying to fuck over your party‚Äù

For the record, my fighter has very decent morals and respect for others. Driving force is equality for all especially among the weak. He would never screw over his party.

After this the DM and party members basically shunned me and now it‚Äôs hard to play.


My questions:
1) How does a boss-level druid that controls thousands of rats not have ANYTHING on a nat 20 loot roll?

2) Why did the DM think my good hearted fighter was going to scree over the party?

3) Even if I wanted to screw over the party, I still rolled a nat 20 whilst trying to loot a bosses corpse that I brought down by myself‚Äî with no help from the party. Should this action invoke punishment and counteract a natural crit loot roll?

I'm linking directing here to the [Fantasy Deck](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/213131/The-GameMasters-Apprentice-Fantasy-Deck), which is aimed at D&amp;d, but there are also other versions available. I also have a complete (and free) [solo game engine called ALONe](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/168609/ALONe-A-Solo-Game-Engine-BETA) if you want to run a game for yourself at home! 

The cards by themselves are decks of 60 two-sided cards (so 120 unique card faces), which means if you draw three cards to build an NPC from a Name, their Belongings, and a Location they are from, you get 1.72 million possible combinations--or more if you draw cards for things like their Virtues and Vices!

He had been selected to kill all of his fellow compatriots, and was going to kill himself, in order to keep the burial location of their glorious leader concealed.

The party prevented the man from wandering off alone into the night, and in drunken stupor, he indicated to them that the burial was ""near here"", which is too much information for his honor to allow them to live. The party now has him tied up, ready for interrogation attempts next session.

My original idea for the sword is that after it has killed 1,000 people, the user can cast the Wish spell. This is how the khan was so successful.

* How much of the rules should I follow?

fmzusu,LateEarthOfficial,How to merge D&amp;D parties without destroying separate campaign timelines,"Covid-19 is ruining many D&amp;D campaigns at the moment, but what's worse is people are getting stuck without a way to socialize at all which is maddening. A friend posted tonight about getting an online campaign together, but his campaign and my own meet on the same night in different places. I suggested that our parties meet up, but his party is in the Underdark and mine is off the coast of Saltmarsh. I thought: Wouldn't it be great if there were a way to join both parties together during all of this without disrupting the separate campaigns. Not to be detoured, this is what I came up with. Due to social isolation being required of many, many people at the moment, Roll20, Dndbeyond and an audio/video conferencing app like Zoom/Discord is recommended for this set up, and no, they did not pay me to plug for them. Without further ado:

**How to merge D&amp;D parties without destroying separate campaign timelines**

Each party, during a long rest, collectively dreams their parties together for a one-off session or longer. No further action/ritual/magic is required beyond this condition.

Both party's DMs collaborate before the session on setting, story elements and level cap. For even play, it is recommended that all player levels be capped to the lowest common level between players, though for the sake of dynamic play, it is not required. With concern to level capping, DMs can agree on what magic items, weapons and other details that higher leveled players do not take with them into the dream meeting, with spells and abilities being governed by level cap. Any items, weapons and other objects lost/not recovered in the dream state will still remain permanently in their respective campaign worlds (no, you cannot lose your oath bow in-dream, so don't fret.) Health for a session like this can be quick-calculated by dividing a player's current total health by their current level, then multiplying the result by the level cap. Ex. An 8th level character with 64 health would have 32 health at a level 4 cap in the dream setting. With that established, during a long rest, players enter a dream world between their respective campaigns settings to commune, fight, learn new lore, uncover secrets of their own worlds and find kindred souls across planes.

There can be 1-2 DMs guiding the game or 1 DM per party and 1 Meta-DM. A Meta-DM (MDM) would act as the dream world's DM (in usual DM fashion) while the other DM's act as planar guides to their respective parties. In essence, upon entering a dream meeting, each party's DM is revealed to them as a character of their DM's choosing. These special DM characters can know some details of the dream-setting and it's purpose, but not everything about the world or why the parties have been brought together, acting as a source of plot material from the MDM while adventuring alongside their own campaign's players.

Another way to play with a 2+ DM scenario is to make one DM a protagonist that employs and/or joins both parties and the other DM a villain or BBEG. In this arrangement, DMs would meet before the session to plan setting and plot as well as their own interactions in game. Given the relationship between these DMs is semi or even completely collaborative, there are many ways to arrange DM/player scenarios that can add dimensions to the game that otherwise might arise from normal play.

When the dream meeting between parties end, both parties wake up after their long rest where they left off in their respective campaigns. Dream meeting achievements can have results that the DMs can choose for their players or not at all. Payouts can include, but are not limited to inspiration points, shared knowledge/information/insight on the campaigns that players return to, small permanent health gains, small magic trinkets/items/mementos, relief from permanent status effects/curses/hexes upon waking, physical regeneration of lost limbs/eyes that are fully healed in-dream by another player, magic/arcane buffs, temporary dream/spirit companions that last into each party's campaign for a period of time determined by the DM and even XP gains. The DMs have discretion on what their players gain as a result of their dream meeting with another party. After the dream campaign ends, both parties retain the memory of the collectively shared dream as though it were a magic image placed in their minds.

(Note: This might or might not be a new idea, but I just personally thought it up while talking to a friend and wrote it down in a .txt, so it's original to me as far as I know. Please suggest your homebrew edits/tweaks here. If you want to use this as a way to get your disjointed groups of D&amp;D parties together and keep the adventures going, by Oden's beard, do it and godspeed you wacky redditor)",14,1584883193,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmzusu/how_to_merge_dd_parties_without_destroying/,DnD,1

My girlfriend settles down on the sofa next to me, grabs her Paladin sheet and, as usual, I ask one of the players to do a recap of the last session.

Now it's been a while since we had a full group because of all the madness currently going on, so the player who has volunteered stalls over where the party is in the world.

I say hang on, I'll upload the map to the group chat and pull up my Google Drive. And goddamit if I didn't forget that Google Drive shows a preview of your five last opened items.

There's my campaign notes, the cattlepunk mini-rpg I'm working on, a sketch I'd just finished and, broadcast across the massive TV my girlfriend is staring at, a high-res close-up of the engagement ring I plan to give her.

fmz679,Rettalic,Made my dwarf a shark,"So I made a oneshot for my friends last month.
A level 3 party with 4 members where they had to seek for ingredients for a cake.
We had: a ranger, a bard, a dwarf paladin, and an orc fighter.
Our orc fighter is irl an easy going dude, but always want to be the leader.
And our dwarf is easy going to the max and a bit silent. (He was also a bit underpowered, especially looking at the orc, he min maxed)
So our orc is agains weaklings and wants to fight everyone, and our dwarf is your friendly small giant.
I prepared some waterbreathing potions for them with a note that they need to use them above water.

Forward to a fight against a octopus, our dwarf is afraid of potions and first didnt want to take a potion. But when they were attacked by an octopus, and our dwarf was pulled under water, he took the potion. And I wanted him to shine for a bit, cause he was way too shy. So I transformed him into a shark.
Everybody laughed. After our dwarf/shark killed the octopus, the orc used rage and swam with a high speed at the shark.
But I had enough of him, so I made them make a strength roll where the shark had a bid advantage.
The orc rolles a 19 and the shark a 14. But I gave him +5, so they rolled equal.
I made them swim so hard at each other that they both were knocked out and had to be pulled to the land.
The after effect of our dwarf's transformation was that he still had a shark tail and had to be moved with the ingredients in a card.

Did I do the right thing?

fmymqw,Giltharin,Horn of War - magic item,"Hi,
Help call from a rookie DM . I created a  a magic item as a reward for the Lvl 3 fighter of the party at the end of a 4 session adventure.

Uncommon wondrous item

Once per long rest a character can sound the horn, using an action. The horn can be heard in a radius of 600 feet and creatures in 60 feet radius are affected:
- allies gain inspiration for one minute
- hostile creatures must pass DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the creature that used the horn for 1 minute

Is it a balanced item?
Cheers

Adding NPCs as meat shields/to fill roles.

Non-combat or low combat sessions. I just feel more interested in combat or at the very least making combat an ever present possibility.

I'm posting her backstory below so you guys can get a better feel for her. As of right now I know she's going to be secretive of her race because they are not liked and she passes herself off as have dragonic ancestry. But past this I don't have much for her. 

Sage originally known as Nara was selected from her brood to be one of the purebloods who would leave from her home, a city hidden deep in the jungle of a small tropical island, to spy on the outside world and gather information. After being selected she was raised for this purpose, Nara was taught how to deceive and manipulate non Yuan-ti she would be forced to interact within the outside world. However, as she grew older, she began to realize that she was not like the others around her she felt the emotions she was being trained to fake. Nara knew if anyone in her clan was to find out she was an imperfect Yuan-ti she would be brutally killed so to keep herself safe she began to repress all her emotions.
¬†
Once it was time Nara was taken to a small coastal town where she was to make her way to one of the larger cities. In the larger city, she would blend in as the owner of a new small herbalism shop who had come to the city for a new start after both of her parents had died. She did as she had been ordered to, she gathered information from travelers, adventures, and people in the city that came to her shop looking for herbal remedies and healing potions. As she followed her orders, she began to have doubts about what she had been taught and her god. The beings she had been taught were a little better than the monkeys that swung in the trees of her home had made great structures and far greater technological and magical advancements than her people; that had not changed for centuries and lived in ruined temples. Her own God had not been heard from nor had made a new Yuan-ti since long before she had been born no matter the number of sacrifices that were given while the gods of these other creatures answered them and gave them abilities for little in return. As her doubts and fears grew, she realized that now she was outside of her clan she could just disappear; no longer having to repress her emotions or serve a crumbling civilization who saw her as little more than a pawn. Nara closed her shop and told the few people she had become close to that she had received a letter from a close friend that wanted her to be present during the birth of their child and promptly left the city.
¬†
After leaving Nara began to go by the name Sage Drogon. Sage traveled north trying to get far away from the reach of her clan she would mainly stay to woodlands and small towns where she would sell herbal remedies. It was during this time Sage began to have dreams of what she would come to learn was the wild mother who would promise her purpose and the power to protect herself if she would fallow her. After several dreams of waking up feeling more balanced then she had ever before she agreed to the wild mother's offer and became of a druid.",2,1584866112,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmwpqk/need_help_with_the_personality_for_a_yuanti_druid/,DnD,1

fmwl5m,Ovidiu_J,Need tips for modifying campaign direction,"I started a campaign including multiple new players. So in session 0, they didn't know exactly what they preferred. I build a homebrew world with an RP-focused, investigation / political intrigue campaign, as that's what I'm most comfortable writing / DMing (since they had no preference, I thought I might as well stick to my comfort zone). 

But as we're playing I'm realizing these guys and gal seem to enjoy high-adrenaline, quick exploration, tense encounters, and combat more than they care about subtle clues and methodical investigation. I love building vivid locations and encounters, so if I knew what I was going for, I'm comfortable switching up the campaign to something else. 

So I want to adapt to what it looks like they will enjoy most and shift the campaign into a higher fantasy gear. 

So far we had a long investigation into a drug-dealing operation in town, where people who consumed the drug died soon after. This ended with them finding the hideout and wiping out the criminals, except for one grunt they kept as a prisoner. They found some letters suggesting someone more influential was sponsoring this operation, but don't yet know who that is. They haven't interrogated the prisoner yet, so there's room to change the direction naturally from here on out, rather than obviously changing gears. 

But I think I'm a bit too constrained by my previous direction/plan on where to take this, so all my ideas on changing gears still go more or less in the same direction, with slightly different flavors. But I think I need something more radical. I would really appreciate an objective opinion/idea.

fmudmc,Surreal_Mango,Thoughts on a puzzle?,"It‚Äôs been a while since I used it but when reminiscing with a player, they convinced me to share the puzzle I created to see what others would think.

Setup: a rich alchemist has died and left the culmination of they‚Äôre beloved research to those he deems mentally worthy, and to sift through the rabble, he has set a puzzle, and left a note.

The problem: the objective is to get to the study through the alchemists lock mechanism clad door. This door consists of heavy steel reinforcement, connected to a weighted brasier that when pushed downwards, expels a searing hot blue flame. Under the brasier leads a pipe that feeds through the bottom and connects into the locking mechanism.

The room: before passing through the door, the room the brasier sits in is littered with an assortment of items, a specific list of which can be found below. Hidden where the DM decides, is a hand written note from the deceased alchemist. (Must be hand written irl)

The note:
 ‚ÄúTo get your wealth and pride in line

Look no further then some sleek and shine

Use the versatile shine of some CoAl

To reach the ends of your goal‚Äù


The rooms contents: 
3 rubies
2 sapphires 
2 emeralds
Copper helmet
Aluminium gauntlet
Titanium breastplate
Steel greaves
Bronze boots
3 silver pieces
1 box of cobalt shards
3 gold pieces
2 platinum pieces
Lead tipped arrow
1 box of coal
1 sack of diamonds
1 rusty pick axe


The answer: after some interaction the players will realise the flame is hot enough to melt the metallic objects in the room. 
Upon inspection of the note the players should realise the intentional inconsistency of the word ‚ÄúCoAl‚Äù
Putting it together that this is an alchemist who wrote this, someone should eventually realise this is in fact a chemical symbol (they‚Äôll realise much sooner if not hand written).
When placing Cobalt (Co) and Aluminium (Al) into the brasier. The compound will melt into the pipe and unlock the door.


Extra note: (the red herring) some players will jump to the conclusion that Co is copper; to make it more exciting and add risk, the DM could set a penalty for wrong answers.

**Blessing of the Forge**

At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it‚Äôs armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it‚Äôs a weapon.
Once you use this feature, you can‚Äôt use it again until you finish a long rest.",9,1584853156,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmude4/can_you_imbue_multiple_items_by_using_the/,DnD,1

Shaking his head, he mutters, ""I really don't want to roleplay"" Not, not play D&amp;D but just not the roleplaying part.

What proceeded of course was merciless mocking.

(I've since let him  off the hook and told him I'll take over after a couple more sessions once I have re-learnt the rules a bit better with the switch from 2nd edition to 5th)",5,1584850620,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmttfs/my_19_year_old_son_is_dming_for_us_and_had_the/,DnD,1

fmtcxk,Day---Day,Funniest Natural 20/Natural 1 Moment in my Games Ever,"**So, I was running a game called The 5th Element, and as you would imagine, the players fight a lot of elementals.  And I have them fighting 2 elemental myrmidons at the moment, one being an earth, other being fire.  They killed the fire easily and then all gang up on the earth 1.  One of my players who's playing the Wood Elf Elluin Gilcan.  He goes to hit it with his longsword, natural 1.  I have a rule where you roll on a table and you'll get a certain punishment depending what you roll on the d6.  He got a 3 which is throw your weapon.  I have him roll an athletics check to see how far, natural 20.  They all thought ""Maybe he didn't throw it"" until I said ""You ain't gettin' that longsword back"" and I explained how it keeps going until you can't even see it anymore, and their all just dying laughing, including the player playing Elluin, all in all, best fight in a long ass time I've gotten to DM.**",4,1584848763,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmtcxk/funniest_natural_20natural_1_moment_in_my_games/,DnD,1

His Patron is Tyr, God of Justice, though whether slaughtering bandits and Orc Marauders with no remorse is truly Justice is up for debate, and he was sired by a Teifling of Asmodean Blood and a Vestal Virgin of Sune. He had a terrible childhood, is plagued by visions of the Nine Hells, and has just returned to Baldur's Gate after years of training and fighting in the Border Wars in the petty Kingdoms near the Shaar. He doesn't want anyone to know his true race, so he wears a helmet and hood at all times, and is none a happy person generally.

fmt2jk,eyvoom,Played DnD with the Quarantined Folk on Roll20 Tonight,"So all 3 of my party members were under quarantine this week (none are sick, just precautions from spouses or otherwise), so getting together wasn't an option.  We looked at several options and decided about 24 hours beforehand that Roll20 would be the way to go.

Aside from it being a bit of a learning curve, it worked really well!!  The voice and video worked great once everyone was connected.  Being able to create and go back to multiple gaming screes worked great.  We had a map for overall travel on one and others for exploration and combat.  I was even able to add some background music.

We did use a combo of Roll20 and D&amp;D Beyond to make everything work.  Everyone has their characters there, and to transfer them over looked like a pain.  I used aspects of both to run the encounters to make things work for the group and myself.

Overall I was very pleased with how things went.  I've downloaded a map tool from Steam to make things a little more visually appealing next time.  For nights when we can't all make it (one guy lives 90 min away) this will be perfect.  I would definitely recommend giving this a try if you're unable to get together in person, or just don't want to risk it right now.",3,1584847543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fmt2jk/played_dnd_with_the_quarantined_folk_on_roll20/,DnD,1

It was once a temple, test site for a celestial being to test her champions but events have led her to lose her sanity, now kidnapping and tossing innocent people into this hellscape. 
1st floor is a typical maze, stone laden walls and floors, no real trickery other than typical traps and beasts.
2nd floor is covered in a thin, 2 inch sheet of water, occasionally breaking away to much deeper depths.
3rd floor is completely dark with magical darkness
4th floor is the hall of mirror, where they will encounter the mad celestial as a final boss (each floor has a boss that I also need help deciding :D). The last floor has lair actions, the walls make of a crystal like material that can spend lair actions to turn reflective, change shape, or take on false appearances. 
I need random encounters for every floor and would greatly love to see how creative you people can get with some ideas of trials and tribulations to throw at these people.
