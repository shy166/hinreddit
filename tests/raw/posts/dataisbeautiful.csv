Some of that information has come from reliable sources, such as the [Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and some have come from less reliable sources.

Here at /r/DataIsBeautiful, we would like to crowdsource and crowd fact-check some of the best and most reliable COVID-19 data sources and dashboards that are currently out there. We'll compile the results of this crowdsourcing effort into a wiki page that everyone can reference.

Let's use this thread to do just that. If you know of a good data source or dashboard for COVID-19 related information, post it in this thread. **Make sure to double-check that your data source or dashboard hasn't already been posted in this thread**, and if it has, upvote that comment instead.

**If you're an expert on COVID-19 and the epidemiological sciences**, [message our mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/dataisbeautiful&amp;subject=Application%20for%20COVID-19%20Expert%20Flair) with proof so you can get a special flair.

fl0rym,rhiever,Let's talk about COVID-19 visualizations and our recent rule changes,"As we [announced yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fki10w/announcement_about_rule_changes_on_covid19_visuals/), the /r/DataIsBeautiful mod team updated the posting rules to put a moratorium on simple line and bar charts showing COVID-19 cases, deaths, and/or recoveries. We'd like to provide some context on that decision and open the decision up for discussion with the community.

COVID-19 has been on many people's minds lately, and that has been reflected in the [overwhelming numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fkoik5/fraction_of_posts_on_dataisbeautiful_that_are/) of COVID-19 related posts that we've seen on the subreddit lately. These posts have been incredibly valuable in spreading awareness about the seriousness of COVID-19, and the /r/DataIsBeautiful mod team is committed to supporting a community that focuses on providing a data-driven understanding of the world.

However, we face a challenge as a community: **60% (and growing) of all of /r/DataIsBeautiful's posts are now about COVID-19**, and most other content has fallen to the wayside for the time being. The biggest challenge has been that a majority of that 60% are slight remakes or updates of the same simple line or bar charts showing COVID-19 cases in various countries, and oftentimes the same authors are posting small updates to their charts on a daily basis. Many of these simple line and bar charts could be replaced with a [COVID-19 case dashboard](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6), which we've stickied to the top of the subreddit.

Despite the above challenge, we acknowledge that we are in trying times and **the /r/DataIsBeautiful subreddit can and should play a key role in spreading awareness about COVID-19.**

**Now we would like to turn to the community for feedback and ideas on how to best manage COVID-19 posts going forward.** What should the mod team do to allow effective COVID-19 visualizations to remain while preventing this subreddit from becoming /r/COVID19Visualizations?",96,1584578830,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fl0rym/lets_talk_about_covid19_visualizations_and_our/,dataisbeautiful,9

I have a PhD in computational neuroscience and robotics, an MSc in knowledge-based systems and an MA in theoretical physics. 

I'm currently Chair of the Advisory Board to the United Nations Global Platform for big data &amp; official statistics, Member of Council for the UK Royal Statistical Society, and previously chair of the Environment Agency Data Advisory Group, vice-chair of the Royal Statistical Society Official Statistics section, and a member of the Open Data User Group ministerial advisory group to Cabinet Office.

Since the Campus was founded in 2017 we have been working on a huge range of projects including:

\- using tax returns, ship tracking data and road traffic sensor data to allow [early identification of large economic changes](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/faster-indicators-of-uk-economic-activity/);

\- exploring [what internet traffic](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/projects/what-can-internet-use-tell-us-about-our-society-and-the-economy/) peaks and troughs can tell us about our lives; 

\- using [satellite imagery to detect surface water](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/projects/DSC-128-SDG-6.6.1.-Surface-water/) and assess changes over time, for rapid detection of emerging issues;

\- launching a hub focused on [data science and AI for International Development](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/ai-for-international-development/), located at the Department for International Development (DfID), near Glasgow.

\- supporting ONS, government and public sector organisations to increase their data science capability. We’re aiming to have 500 trained data science practitioners for UK government by 2021.

I'll be here to talk about statistics, data and making the world a better place from **3-5pm GMT** today.
