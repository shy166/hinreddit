Hi everyone! I'm a home gardener, living in VERY sunny Phoenix Arizona and I've been gardening for years now. I am by no means amazing at it, but I grow vegetables, and recently flowers, in my backyard. 

I saw on Reddit that a lot of people are searching about growing vegetables at home, and I thought that I should do an IAmA about it. If you have any questions in general, questions about seeds, questions about terminology, are curious what kind of work is involved or what kinds of plants you can grow... literally anything, ask away! This'll probably get lost in the weeds, but so long as I can help one person then it'll be worth it.

About the garden: my yard is a cozy 15ft by 20ft and half of it is used specifically for vegetable gardening. I garden in raised beds and use an automatic soaker hose drip system. I grow whatever I can and currently have kale, bell peppers, ancho peppers, thai peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, spinach, chamomile, green onions, oregano, cilantro, mint, cat nip, zucchini, cucumber, peas, beans, rosemary, swiss chard, basil and literally anything that will fit and grow. Some from seed, some from transplant.

Quite a bit has changed since then so I thought people would be interested in how I've been!

FAQ

I'm 17 right now. I got my first implant when I was ten months old, and my second one when I was 15 years old. I can hear almost as well as a normal human being, but am essentially considered ""Hard of Hearing"" (dunno why the Deaf community hates that term so much).

I have a small [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsU0y8bvBBxwz2Vll6OmOcw) with a mix of gaming and spreading of Deaf awareness. Plenty of content from years past to check out (too busy with college now to keep creating).

My dad is hearing, but my mom is deaf. Since my condition is congenital, that must mean there was a recessive gene in my dad's family somehow.

DON'T. BE. SORRY. I am happy as can be with being Deaf, and I pride myself on being able to relate with others of the same condition and spreading awareness about it. That's why I made this AMA.",147,1585667555,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fsemdm/iama_profoundly_deaf_teenager_who_had_his_second/,IAmA,2

COVID-19 has created many problems for so many people who are unable to work because of the psychological and/or physical effects of this pandemic. It has also affected disabled persons’ ability to get treatments because of the closure of clinics and limited availability of doctors. Many people have questions about how to deal with their long-term disability insurance companies in Canada and I can answer them. I deal with the denial of disability claims every day, and advise people on their rights when it comes to long term disability and personal injuries.

I was raised in an orthodox, Jewish community and published my first novel in 2013. It was an instant hit, and sold well in Orthodox communities all over the world. I’m proud to say it helped raise awareness of mental health issues and normalized therapy and medication, which is highly stigmatized in that community.  


My second novel was published a few years later and by that time, I was on my way out of the community for a long list of reasons.  


I self-published my most recent novel on Amazon in 2018, when I was fully irreligious and frankly, feeling frustrated with the community I had left. I wrote about sexual abuse and sexuality and self-harm and all sorts of taboo topics, all written about a bunch of Orthodox, Jewish girls that are labeled as “troubled”.  


Ironically, I still get “fan mail” from young girls who have read my first 2 books and are obsessed with those characters. They assume I’m still the inspirational, religious woman that I seemed to be in my first two books.  


All of my books are available on Amazon, and I’m making my newest book free for the next few days (Kindle) to give folks something to read during this quarantine.  


So go ahead and ask me anything about writing, leaving the community, my favorite drink, if I think Carol Baskin killed her husband, etc.",642,1585660703,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fscr7z/i_was_a_bestselling_author_in_my_orthodox_jewish/,IAmA,1

fs36zu,PuppyMama22,"I was an intern at big cat rescue, the sanctuary run by Carole Baskin, recently brought into the spotlight by the Netflix docu-series, Tiger King. Ask me anything!","[proof](http://imgur.com/a/B2feSMz)

Note that my sweatshirt says volunteer on the front, but it does say intern on the back. In the series, Carole talks about the royal blue shirts being interns. 

I was an intern at BCR for three months in the summer of 2017. I went there right after completing my bachelor's degree in zoology. At the time, my goal was to become an exotic animal caretaker which is a hard field to break into so bcr was the perfect opportunity for me to gain experience for my resume. However, I chose to leave the field because of the compassion fatigue I experienced. 

I know everyone's burning question is: what's there difference between big cat rescue and the gw zoo? So I'm just going to answer that one here.  

1. Accreditation: bcr is accredited by the global federation of animal sanctuaries. This means they do not buy, sell, trade, touch or breed any of their animals. Gw zoo is not accredited. 

2. Enclosures: big cat rescue keeps the majority of their cats in enclosures by themselves because of the solitary nature of cats. The only exception to this is cats that were raised together and show signs that they wish to be together. The enclosures are also very spacious, each cat having at least 1200 square feet. They even have ""vacation rotation"" a 2.5 acre enclosure in which the larger cats are rotated through as a form of enrichment. There is also a smaller version for smaller cats. The enclosures also provide lots of greenery and hiding spots for cats that do not wish to be seen. At the gw zoo, cats are kept in small cages in high numbers. They are often baren and forced to be seen by visitors. 

3. Feeding: big cat rescue feeds every cat every day with the exception of fasting for medical purposes. Each cat has their own special diet prepared by volunteers and interns every day. The meat used is the same meat that you or I would eat. They also feed a large variety from chicken to pork to beef, you name it. No cat ever has to fight over food. In an enclosure where two cats are kept together, they are separated into different ""bubbles"" of their enclosure to ensure that there is no food aggression. Gw zoo feeds expired meat from Walmart, diseased cows and even road kill. This meat is thrown into large groups of cats and they are forced to fight over it and there is often not enough for all the cats. 

4. Conservation: big cat rescue donates thousands annually to funds that go towards the conservation of these cats in the wild. They also have a rehab program where they rescue injured or orphaned Florida bobcats, rehabilitate them and release them back into the wild. As far as I know, the gw zoo does neither of these things. 

And that's not all! There are so many other things that big cat rescue does to provide the best care possible for these cats. I have lived in this world and can testify that Carole Baskin is in it for the right reasons.",3111,1585616076,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fs36zu/i_was_an_intern_at_big_cat_rescue_the_sanctuary/,IAmA,1

I began practicing magic when I was 16, but even before I was 16 I wanted magic to be real. I would read fantasy books and wonder what it would be like actually practice magic. Then when I was 16, I discovered Magic as real. A friend of mine sat me and down and told me about his magical experiences and at the end I asked him for books to read. Thus began my life long love relationship with magic.

What’s really driven me to practice magic is my insatiable curiosity. I had lots of questions as a kid and those questions have only multiplied since, but what Magic provided me was a means to get answers and ask more questions.

&gt;Hi! I'm Kevin Pham, the Reddit Social  Supervisor of the Young Americans Coalition for Unity. (a 501c4 focused  on engaging young people in politics across the political spectrum) As a  youth organization mostly ran by a diverse range of students under the  age of 18, we're excited to launch our first major project today!  
&gt;  
&gt;In  light of record high COVID-19 cases in the United States, we feel that  we can all contribute in this fight. Our first big project, Masks for  Medics, has officially launched today to combat the severe shortage of  masks plaguing the American Healthcare system. Masks for Medics is an  initiative founded by youth leaders of the YACU to help get medical  masks from those who don’t need them into the hands of doctors. M4M  fulfills an important need during this time of having a centralized  organization promoting this essential necessity and providing a simple  process for people to contribute. Unfortunately, we cannot accept money  donations as of this time. Any excess face masks will be appreciated!  
&gt;  
&gt;Feel free to learn more about this program at our **official website** [**here**](https://www.yacu.org/masks)**.**  If you have any questions on our future goals, the donation process, or anything else, we'll continue to answer questions until **8 PM EST.** In addition to me, our Political Director Andrew Juan, Digital Director Aidan Chinn, Communication Director Aiden Rood, and *Jacob* will be active today. Please be nice to us!

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can be associated with marked changes in activity and energy levels and extreme mood variation, from depression through to hypomania and mania. The condition can result in physical health problems and difficulties functioning in work, school or relationships. But, critically, with optimal treatment, care and empowerment, people with bipolar disorder can and do flourish and have good quality of life.
 
CREST.BD uses a pioneering approach in which researchers, healthcare providers, and people with bipolar disorder, work together to advance research and knowledge exchange. Everything we do - from deciding what to research, writing applications for funding, to doing the research and publishing the results, we do hand-in-hand with people with bipolar disorder. We specialize in producing digital health tools to share evidence-informed treatments and self-management strategies, such as our online quality of life assessment tool ([QoL Tool](http://bdqol.com)) and our signature [Bipolar Wellness Centre](http://bdwellness.com).

About ‘Fodder On My Wings’:
Recorded in 1982, not long after she moved to Paris, ‘Fodder On My Wings’ was one of Nina Simone’s favorite albums yet has remained one of her most obscure. Recorded at a time when Simone was feeling rejuvenated by her surroundings and by the African musicians she met in her newly adopted France, ‘Fodder On My Wing’s is an essential Simone album.

&gt; I teach American history at a small private school outside of Boston. I am the author of *Searching for Black Confederates: The Civil War's Most Persistent Myth,* *Remembering the Battle of the Crater: War as Murder* and editor of *Interpreting the Civil War at Museums and Historic Sites*. You can find my writings at the Atlantic, The Daily Beast, Smithsonian, New York Times, and Washington Post. You can also find me online at my blog [Civil War Memory](https://cwmemory.com) and on twitter \[[@kevinlevin](https://twitter.com/KevinLevin)\].
&gt; 
&gt; The subject of Black Confederates is one of the most misunderstood topics in American history.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's the book blurb:
&gt; 
&gt; More than 150 years after the end of the Civil War, scores of websites,  articles, and organizations repeat claims that anywhere between 500 and  100,000 free and enslaved African Americans fought willingly as soldiers  in the Confederate army. But as Kevin M. Levin argues in this carefully  researched book, such claims would have shocked anyone who served in  the army during the war itself. Levin explains that imprecise  contemporary accounts, poorly understood primary-source material, and  other misrepresentations helped fuel the rise of the black Confederate  myth. Moreover, Levin shows that belief in the existence of black  Confederate soldiers largely originated in the 1970s, a period that  witnessed both a significant shift in how Americans remembered the Civil  War and a rising backlash against African Americans’ gains in civil  rights and other realms.
&gt; 
&gt; Levin also investigates the roles that  African Americans actually performed in the Confederate army, including  personal body servants and forced laborers. He demonstrates that  regardless of the dangers these men faced in camp, on the march, and on  the battlefield, their legal status remained unchanged. Even long after  the guns fell silent, Confederate veterans and other writers remembered  these men as former slaves and not as soldiers, an important reminder  that how the war is remembered often runs counter to history.

frk56d,JustHackingAround,IAmA former DarkWeb Hacker who was active in 2012-2018 AMA!,"**A short story of my life in the DW:**

I joined DW in the Falls of 2012. It was fascinating and well, mostly amazing. I'll categorize these hackers into general 5 ranks to explain things in detail. A Rank 1 is a freshman at a college, getting bullied by the Ranks greater than themselves. I began at Rank 2 because of my pre-knowledge about a little bit of things. I tried being a WHH which didn't quite work for me at the beginning. It seemed like I was asking for trouble. Once, I tried saving a 12 year old girl from a live stream by leaking a little bit of IP Address of the well,  pedo to a news media but the message was being blocked. And then, a guy approached me. It turns out the was a Rank 4 just to give you a little bit of context. I was lucky because if this dude worked for the pedo, I'd not be alive. He messaged me my address and told me these words, ""Get ahead of yourself, superman."" I don't know why he decided to help me but he told me to buy 2 computers, one for IP spoofing and one for well, access the DW. I made sure that I didn't do anything that could get me suspected. I even plugged out the cameras and microphone from the laptop. Yes, I went high budget just to get my ass of the stalkers.

Did I continue my good deeds? No. I created ports for drug trafficking in late 2014 which made me a better hacker than before. Giving you context, a Rank 3. And then, in 2015, I got arrested, I can't exactly tell you where but in a 'big' city. I was shook by the news and well, I accepted agreement to leak the IP of suspicious activities. Obviously if I leaked the IP of a Rank 2 or above, my life expectancy would significantly drop badly, so, I leaked the IP of simple credit card leakers and got away with it. When I got the news that I was free, I was ready to get away from DarkWeb.

If you were to ask me something, I won't answer the things related to assassination and the crypto currency I own.

**Proof that I am this dude here:**

These people have freedom on the information they possess.|These are the most active hackers. They remain less frequently active to spoof the IP trackers.

# Why Being a Father is So Important To Me:

When I was really young, maybe 1 or so. My mom and dad split.

My dad ended up moving 700 miles away and I stopped seeing him as much.

For quite a few years I'd fly out to see him in the summer, but eventually I stopped seeing him at all.

He's dealt with mental health issues and he's a great guy. But shit happens I guess.

It's unfortunate and I don't blame him, but I actively strive to be a better parent than him, for sure. 

What's really hurtful is that he had another kid around 8 or so years ago and he takes care of him full time. He had to go through great lengths and  fought really hard to get custody. 

And while it's the right thing to do, it's kind of a slap in the face.

I'd be lying if I said that doesn't affect me.

Especially since he's still not in touch with me or his grand kids.

It makes you feel *discarded.*

So being an active father is extremely important to me.

Insult to injury, I didn't have a great experience with father figures from that point forward.

A close friend of my moms and someone who I trusted and really looked up to decided it would be fun to beat me until his hands were bruised.

I was 5 at the time... but it has stuck with me for life. Trust isn't something that's easily earned with me.

A few dick head stepdads and I've got plenty of examples of what **NOT** to be.

Luckily, I have a wonderful, supportive, loving mother. And so, I didn't grow up *too* *fucked up.*

# Personal Life &amp; Growing Up

Growing up, I guess I was a bit of a handful.

I started smoking, doing drugs, and drinking very young. 14 or so?

No real run in with cops, but I've been in the back of a few cop cars and spent more time in the principal’s office than in the classroom.

At one point I was sent to a ""milder"" version of Scared Straight.

For those who don't know it's where you get sent to a prison and walk among the inmates, get locked in a cell, etc...

I got locked in a cell a bit longer than everyone else because apparently, I rubbed the people running it the ***wrong way.***

They assured me that I, personally, not everyone else, would be back for a permanent stay by 18.

A sentiment that many of my teachers shared.

But luckily for me, and due to some life changes, that's now how my story ends

# Professional Life

At age 18 I started a job at a fortune 500 company. I didn't think much of it at the time, but it turned into a very successful and rewarding career.

By 20 I was making more money than the teachers, law enforcement, and other ""authorities"" in my life who assured me I would never amount to anything.

At age 20. That *felt like success.*

At 33, I can tell you that it was not.

In similar fashion to how I grew up, I went against the grain.

I didn't really fit the corporate mold.

Everyone told me I needed to change X Y &amp; Z or do this or do that differently.

But one thing I always have been, and always will be...

....is unapologetically my authentic self. Whether it holds me back or propels me forward.

I have my values and I am unwavering in operating by them.

Even with that I climbed the corporate ladder into management, I overhauled the new hire training process, I taught people how to better their careers and incomes within our working ecosystem.

I was a mini celebrity where I worked and had the opportunity to influence and improve the lives of many others. It was VERY rewarding.

Something I'd like to be able to do again one day, but not at another J-O-B.

13 years in I think I shocked a lot of people by quitting.

# Working up the nerve to quit

It was scary. Especially because I have no education, or formal training.

There's no way I could go back to the workforce and make that kind of money again.

It took me 9 years of imagining it, thinking about it, saying I was going to do it...

... Before I finally worked up the nerve to actually do it.

And I'm glad I did.

I always felt like a round peg in a square hole working in corporate America.

Truthfully, I feel like that in most areas of life.

I've always had this deep, burning desire for something better.

That I'm meant for something bigger.

I want to position myself to reach as many people as possible and help them live their best lives, or at least teach them how to be happy with life no matter what it looks like.

And I'd love to build a community for kids who are ""underprivileged"" and don't have access to the things that middle-class people do.

I didn't have to earn millions of dollars to learn that ""wealth"" and ""possessions"" and many of the thing we idolize mean absolutely nothing.

And that you can be just as happy in a one-bedroom apartment as you can in a mansion.

And it takes a lot of effort to feel that way.

But that's another story for another day.

# Personal life &amp; Adulting

As I said earlier, I started drinking and smoking when I was 14.

I've been a heavy, heavy drinker (not anymore) and smoker (not anymore) for most of my life.

Drinking, Partying, Smoking. 

I had plenty of money and no responsibility.

I was definitely going down a path that would have landed me in jail and proved everyone right.

***But Things Changed...***

I got married and had kids very young.

I was around 21 at the time.

But it probably **saved my life**

Like I explained before, I take a ton of pride in being a parent.

I quit smoking, but I did not quit drinking.

But I did not go out and drink &amp; party.

And I did not drink when the kids were awake.

I didn't realize it until I quit, but I was drinking heavily to escape my own reality.

Some years pass and I'm definitely not happy, but I love my kids.

And I had a responsibility to provide for them which is why I kept a stable job for so long and worked so hard.

My ex-wife stayed at home with them which I'm thankful for.

I believe that we're far removed from our biological/natural roles as parents.

I couldn't imagine paying someone to raise my kids for 8 hours a day.

Now understand, I'm not shaming anyone who does.

And I'm not against it.

And I understand that it's not an option for many people out there.

But I just didn't want that for my kids.

Since moving up in Corporate America requires **sacrifice**

I do feel like I missed out on a lot with my kids when they were younger.

There were months that I worked until 10pm or midnight, etc...

So, you miss the mornings.

You miss the evenings.

You have your days off and some time in between, but you still miss **ALOT.**

And then...

# My Life Crumbled Before My Eyes...

So, there's a lot I still haven't told you. Imagine that.

There are a lot of details that I feel are pertinent, but out of respect I will not mention.

Because there's the way I see it.

And there's the way my ex-wife sees it.

And somewhere in between is probably a truth.

But when we divorced **it almost ruined me.**

And it was devastating because during that process I lost what was most important to me.

And that was seeing my kids.

I racked up over $30,000 in lawyer fees throughout the divorce trying to get joint physical custody (50/50) of my kids.

And I ***STILL*** ended up with every other weekend and 50/50 in the summers.

When I got the call from my lawyer I just broke down and cried.

**I WAS CRUSHED.**

I was still working during this time and my mental health was going to shit.

My life was spiraling out of control.

I was in my late 20's acting like I did when I was a teenager.

At work I literally ended up back in the entry level position I started at when I was 18.

13 years of hard work and sacrifice down the drain.

I got into legal trouble.

I was hurting everyone around me.

**I WAS FUCKING EVERYTHING UP.**

# Rising from the Ashes

So after essentially lighting my world on fire

The dust started to settle and my current wife (girlfriend at the time) told me if I didn't quit drinking then she wouldn't be with me.

And the next day I gave up drinking forever.

Fast forward a bit and I spent a lot of time in self-development and taking control of the way I think.

I never thought it was possible to control what you're thinking and what you're feeling regardless of the circumstances.

But practicing that has made such a huge difference in my life.

So, over the next few years I began rebuilding my life.

I was crushed every day by the fact that I couldn't see my kids as much as I wanted, and it still weighs heavy on me to this day.

But I knew I either had to get up and move on or sit there and deteriorate.

At work I started moving back up and reclaiming all that I had worked for.

My wife and I decided to start our own little family.

# When She Was Born, I Knew I Couldn't Go Back

Despite all the effort I put into rebuilding my career

When my daughter was born, I knew that I absolutely had quit.

And I'm sure that shocked a lot of people, especially because turning my career around and climbing back up the corporate ladder was almost unheard of.

But...

I wanted to be the one who raised her.

Who woke up when she cried, and changed every diaper, wiped away every tear, etc..

And it's the **BEST** decision I have ever made.

# Well, The Best &amp; Worst

I became so involved and so obsessed with doing everything to make sure that my daughter was being raised the best way possible that I stopped taking care of myself.

I'd forget to eat, forget to shower, forget to brush my teeth.

She WAS MY WORLD

And nothing else made me happy.

And that was a problem.

I was trying to start a business because like I said, I'm still responsible for my own bills, the mortgage, etc..

That's about $5k/mo. all said and done.

But I kept failing.

Analysis paralysis, laziness, obsession.

I became very depressed.

When my daughter slept, I just sat on the couch and gamed.

I couldn't move, couldn't get motivated, stopped working out, stopped working on my business.

Played video games for hours on end.

My wife and I had no connection.

She was frustrated

I was frustrated.

Everything was falling apart.

The only time I felt alive, felt like myself, felt like doing anything

Was with my daughter.

I couldn't stop smiling, laughing, doing things to make her happy.

I gave her **EVERYTHING THAT I HAD.**

# Rising from The Ashes Part II

So, I finally got myself out of the slump.

I made it back to the gym.

I completely QUIT playing videogames. (I have an addictive personality. It's all or nothing)

Got dressed and took care of my appearance every day.

Ditched my first business and started fresh.

I invested well over $5k into learning a new skillset so I'd have skin in the game.

I'm still enamored of my daughter.

But now there's a healthy balance.

And I can say for sure

# Quitting My Job Has Changed My Life

My outlook

My positivity

My mental well being

My satisfaction in life.

I would not be the person I am today, had I not gone through everything.

And the largest part responsible for my transformation was quitting my job.

It taught me to be content in a small house.

To be content with little to no money.

It **forced** me to reflect on myself -- my actions.

I learned to be **100% accountable**

**For everything in my life.**

Whether I'm the one doing it or someone else is

I can control how I feel, How I react, and what I do next.

But I definitely underestimated how hard it would be to make my own income and raise a baby. 

There was a lot of struggling 

Growth 

Figuring things out 

When you have a job you walk in and you know what to do. 

When you work for yourself for the first time you wake up and have no clue where to begin. 

Your software, hardware, which applications you need to use, how to track customers. 

When you work for someone else everything is laid out for you. And all you have to do is show up and do your job. 

I had a plan when I quit and that all went out the window after the first week or two. 

They say you don't know what you don't know 

And it was a crude awakening. 

# $100k to Zero Real Fast

I didn't plan for all of these struggles.

And now my savings are gone.

I just recently started making decent money, but I haven't gotten ahead quite yet

To be honest I really just started getting a grasp on prospecting a couple of months ago. 

I just emptied the last of my account paying child support and my mortgage 

So I have until the end of April to make enough money to pay my bills for May and continue staying home with my daughter. 

Above all else I have to be able to maintain a roof over her head. 

But the last thing I want to do is return to corporate America.

I have a plan and I have a skill

I'm a hard core introvert and so prospecting can be difficult for me. 

I was considering documenting from April 1st - April 30th through video and blogging exactly what I'm doing to:

* Stay healthy
* Prospect
* Balance being a stay at home dad and working
* Making the amount of money I need to pay my mortgage and stay home with my daughter (roughly $5k/mo.)
* My daily routine and whatever life throws my way during that time. 

Maybe some people will find it interesting

And it may be just what I need to hold myself accountable

It's certainly far outside my comfort zone, but it's time to grow. 

And I hope some you will enjoy my story and be interested in seeing where it goes.

I used to be scared to quit my job.

Scared of pissing off a customer.

Nervous to speak to someone.

Afraid of being fired

And right now

**Literally EVERYTHING is on the line for me.**

I cannot go back to corporate America

And I cannot allow myself to not be here with my daughter.

Yet, I'm not nervous one bit.

I plan on crushing my goals. 

Okay I gave you guys a lot. AMA. 

 

**P.S.** I forgot to mention that we have another baby due in May. So the stakes are that much higher for me right now.

Okay... I look forward to chatting with everyone.

fr7hjz,JustHackingAround,IAmA former hacker which was active in DarkWeb throughout 2012-2018 AMA!,"**A short story of my life in the DW:**

I joined DW in the Falls of 2012. It was fascinating and well, mostly amazing. I'll categorize these hackers into general 5 ranks to explain things in detail. A Rank 1 is a freshman at a college, getting bullied by the Ranks greater than themselves. I began at Rank 2 because of my pre-knowledge about a little bit of things. I tried being a WHH which didn't quite work for me at the beginning. It seemed like I was asking for trouble. Once, I tried saving a 12 year old girl from a live stream by leaking a little bit of IP Address of the well,  pedo to a news media but the message was being blocked. And then, a guy approached me. It turns out the was a Rank 4 just to give you a little bit of context. I was lucky because if this dude worked for the pedo, I'd not be alive. He messaged me my address and told me these words, ""Get ahead of yourself, superman."" I don't know why he decided to help me but he told me to buy 2 computers, one for IP spoofing and one for well, access the DW. I made sure that I didn't do anything that could get me suspected. I even plugged out the cameras and microphone from the laptop. Yes, I went high budget just to get my ass of the stalkers.

Did I continue my good deeds? No. I created ports for drug trafficking in late 2014 which made me a better hacker than before. Giving you context, a Rank 3. And then, in 2015, I got arrested, I can't exactly tell you where but in a 'big' city. I was shook by the news and well, I accepted agreement to leak the IP of suspicious activities. Obviously if I leaked the IP of a Rank 2 or above, my life expectancy would significantly drop badly, so, I leaked the IP of simple credit card leakers and got away with it. When I got the news that I was free, I was ready to get away from DarkWeb.

If you were to ask me something, I won't answer the things related to assassination and the crypto currency I own.

**Proof that I am this dude here:**

 [This information was leaked by 'me' in 2015.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2322062/Seven-cyber-hackers-caught-stealing-45-million-10-hours-second-biggest-bank-robbery-history-New-York.html)

I worked with the name Kasper76\_ in DW, if you're familiar with that name, yeah, that's me.

I cannot leak you anymore about this situation.

Just to be safe, I'm using a 5 phase VPN and a fresh account. I'll try to be active all I can.

**Providing some context:**

|Ranks (only contextual, not official)|The maximum activity they can hold on to.|How much will they damage intellectuals?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|I|They can leak your paypal account. They can perform professional IP phishing. They can ghost quite high in DW.|They can force intellectuals to suicide if they really create an impact but a FIR or report would solve your problem.|
|II|They can turn on your camera, microphones, etc. easily. They can scam online sellers mostly in AliBaba and Amazon. *Note: I think Amazon has already fixed that but with technology, nothing remains the same.*|They usually force intellectuals on dark webs to buy their products which are brought by scamming online sellers. Intellectuals can get in serious trouble if this is followed. But they won't kill you.|
|III|They can cause explosions by increasing your device's thermal capacity. They can easily kill any non-hacker or non-assassin or non-mafia or non-popular or non-political citizen.|These guys don't affect intellectual that much even if they can technically 'kill' them. They usually target hackers and generally are white hat hackers.|
|IV|These guys are killing machines, they break about 98 laws a month usually in weekends. These remain active throughout Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. These people have freedom on the information they possess.|These are the most active hackers. They remain less frequently active to spoof the IP trackers. Usually, the government is after them 24/7. *Note:* *Back in 2014, these hackers were way ahead of technologies, so, it was really hard to get them.*|
|V|Active around once a month. They can perform serious illegal activities. If a hacker and a hitman were to be combined together, you imagine a little bit of insanity. These guys are usually pedophiles but not all pedophiles are these guys. You get the concept. *Note: As of March 29, 2020, it seems that there are 3 of these people active on regular intervals.*|These guys are hired by mafias and the people they release into their websites (either to sell or to kill) are usually hackers, relatives of very well-known people.|",9,1585495309,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fr7hjz/iama_former_hacker_which_was_active_in_darkweb/,IAmA,1

fr615s,Antedevan,"What it the purpose of ""evil""?","A question without answer: **The Stanford Riddle**. *""Please do not answer me, I'm not a joke""*

**What’s greater than God, more evil than the Devil, the poor have, the rich need, and if you eat it you’ll die?**

God  represents virtue, the Devil represents evil, the eating represents the  intangible. The part about the rich and poor is relative and is meant  to destabilize. So the possible solutions could be:

**1/ Used for virtue as well as for a evil.**

**2/ Necessarily intangible things like concepts.**

Here some proposals :

«  Ideas », « Gentrification », « Obligation », « Time », « Youth », «  Organization », « Unity », « Faith », « Intelligence », « Liberty », «  Truth », « Honesty », « Youthfulness», « Philosophy », « Emotions », «  Domination », « Observation », « Power », « History », « Internet », «  Literature », « Evanescence », « Sentiment »,  « Noun », « Opportunity  », « Wakening », « Fatality », « Energy », « Art », « Redemption », «  Youngsters », « Objectification », « Unconscious », « Reaction », «  Science », « Telepathy », « Utopia », « Present », « Ideology », «  Determination », « Ideals », « Termination », « Yearning ».

That was a message for some people that some of us met in our early life, the rest is randomly put here :

«  a sense of humor », « freedom », « emotional intelligence », «  curiosity », « honesty », « knowledge », « desire », « pleasure », «  confidence », « science », « questions », « joy », « love », « religion  », « charm », « magic », « a connection to the collective unconscious »,  « a question without answer ».

Some of them might be wrong depending of your interpretation and there might  be way more solutions we just can't figure out yet. If light is the  tangible symbol of truth, then its its quite easy to find the symbol of  lies, which would be intangible by definition...

Second ""clinical death"": I was in agonizing pain after surgery so I received loads of pain killers. The pain, coupled with an immense amount of pain killers, caused my pulse to drop to around 10bpm and my respiratory system shut down.

Being an expat myself and understanding the dynamics of living abroad, I love supporting others who are in a similar position to live life to the fullest. 

The COVID-19 virus puts us in a unique position, with many people being stuck in countries which are not their own, plans cancelled, and feelings isolation, uncertainty, and confusion being high.

I am also the youngest foreigner from any western country to participate in this conflict, as far as I'm aware, by a decent margin.

I saw combat in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and worked alongside a variety of Ukrainian servicemen and women. My occupation was infantry, and I served predominately in a mechanized unit.

I had the opportunity to visit multiple cities across the country, and interact with all sorts of different people, from all sides of the political spectrum. I also taught English in Kyiv for a brief period after my military contract ended.

Ask me anything about Ukraine, it's culture, conflict, cuisine, climate, people, topography, or it's workings! I am in 'quarantine' (read: *day-drinking*) because of COVID-19 and will be around until late this evening.

(*I understand this conflict in particular is a sensitive topic for some, so I encourage everybody to maintain a certain amount of levity; I will answer all questions to the best of my abilities.)*

fq1z0l,MobileGamesAnalyst,IamA former data analyst from a mobile games company. I'm working with a journalist from the New York Times to be a whistle-blower on what I believe are unethical business practices that are rampant in the industry. AMA!,"I have previously verified this AMA with mods using confidential proof.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of odds and ends here:

1. I'm not willing to disclose anything about the company I worked for, only things that apply across the industry.
2. The business practices that I outline below are \*\*NOT\*\* unique to one company.
3. Our games were casino-style games. No real money could be earned. But because of that, kids could also play them. Users would spend money on digital goods used to play casino games.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*The main practices I find to be unethical:\*\*

1. These games do not have a centralized community, which means prices can be manipulated on a user-to-user basis.
2. The ""Store"" where you purchased digital goods from has thousands of versions... all with manipulated prices to try and get you to spend more
3. There's a very low chance that you and someone else see the same stores
4. The main strategy is to play with the value of the digital good. Take standard prices like $1, $2, $5, $10, and $20. What the plan to start is to ""juice"" the $1 level by offering say 300% of the ""regular value"". This gets people to spend.
5. From there, once you've started spending, they will reduce that level back down to the regular 100%, but then they'll increase the $2 level to 300%. Now you can buy 10 digital goods for $1 (where you used to get 30 for $1 with the 300% boost), or you can buy 60 for $2. So they want to try and push you to higher and higher price levels.
6. Once you're at higher prices levels, they use tactics to make you purchase more frequently, such as suppressing values (to the regular 100%) and then once you purchase the first time in a day, they juice the values really high (say to 400%) to try and get you to buy a SECOND time that day.
7. Any pattern that you exhibit is likely to be exploited wherever possible to try and make you spend more revenue. Again, this is \*\*standard practice\*\* in the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Topics I am knowledgeable about:

1. How new additions to the game are tested
2. How these changes are evaluated
3. Anything you want to ask about, I'll do my best :)",37,1585332119,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fq1z0l/iama_former_data_analyst_from_a_mobile_games/,IAmA,0
fq1p7b,LiveWithEarth,I’m a sustainable energy activist that was just promoted to Protection Engineer at one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. AMA.,"Hello, my name is Ricardo Rangel. I am a sustainable energy activist and a Protection Engineer at one of the nation’s largest electric utilities. My long-term goal is to help solve the major challenges with transitioning to 100% renewable energy. As I sought a career path, it seemed obvious the best position to achieve my goal was within the electric utility since the transition to 100% renewable energy will require transforming the electric grid. 

My first position in the industry was Design Engineer where I was responsible for developing construction packages for new substation equipment. With a recent promotion to Protection Engineer my new job responsibilities are to design protection systems to clear faults for safety and reliability. System Protection is considered the most technically challenging and prestigious position within the company. The experience I will gain is absolutely critical to achieve my long-term goal since renewable energy and storage require protection systems. 

While in graduate school at UCLA, I did fundamental research to design 100% renewable power systems. I have shared my work with leading engineers in the company and have received recognition. My new colleagues say that renewable energy is a challenge in protection systems, and I hope to solve these problems and advocate for renewable energy. AMA.

fpz45d,financialtimes,"The global economy is bracing for recession. I'm Joe Rennison, capital markets reporter at the FT. Ask me anything.","February ended with the biggest stock market sell-off since the financial crisis, as stretched valuations collided with a realisation that a pandemic could tip the global economy into recession. Investors are grappling with the ramifications for US stock, bond and the currency markets. Is it time to start buying battered equity and corporate bond markets?

Global stocks [gave up four months of gains](https://www.ft.com/content/4b23a140-59d3-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc) in the last week of February as investors got anxious because of the coronavirus, wiping one-tenth off equity values on mounting concern that the outbreak will stunt economic growth and corporate profits.

Markets have always been prone to booms and busts. But the intensity of February’s last week also reflects a recent phenomenon, where market turbulence evaporates for long stretches, but then is rattled by more violent shocks. 

I’m a capital markets reporter at the FT focused on US credit. I can also chat about what's going on more broadly in markets as banks, investors, companies and the population as a whole face the worst economic crisis in more than a decade.

""Digestive symptoms are common in COVID19, occurring as the chief complaint in nearly half of patients presenting to hospital according to a new descriptive, cross-sectional multicenter study from China by investigators from the Wuhan Medical Treatment Expert Group for COVID-19 published today in *The American Journal of Gastroenterology*.

Most patients with COVID-19 present with typical respiratory symptoms and signs. However, early experience with the outbreak in Wuhan, China revealed that many patients experienced digestive symptoms as their chief complaint. “Clinicians must bear in mind that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of COVID-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in these cases rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge,” write the authors.""

\-Fighting to keep cannabis stores open

\-Working to ensure freelancers and gig workers can get safety net benefits

\-Ensuring people facing financial troubles can access food

\-And more

I just introduced legislation – SB 939 – to place a moratorium on commercial evictions during this crisis so our small businesses have a fighting chance at reopening. I’m co-authoring AB 828, to put a moratorium on renter evictions.

When San Francisco shut down all non-essential businesses, I fought to get cannabis stores re-opened because cannabis is medicine for so many. The San Francisco Department of Public Health listened, and now dispensaries are open.

I'm also a gay man, and am barred from giving blood (despite the massive blood shortage we have due to COVID-19) because of outdated, discriminatory regulations the FDA has in place. I'm calling on the FDA to reverse its ban on gay and bisexual men donating blood if they haven’t been celibate for the past year.

fpfyis,Feinmusic,I have Hemophilia. March is Bleeding Disorder Awareness Month. AMA,"I work as a musician and I've been doing fundraising for state Hemophilia chapters this month but unfortunately due to COVID-19 all gatherings have been scrapped for the foreseeable future. I figured an AMA would be a good opportunity to bring some additional awareness to my disorder and blood disorders on a grander level if not more nuance to chronic conditions on the whole.

The quickest way to explain my condition, Hemophilia A, is that my body does not produce an adequate amount of a specific factor within my plasma to allow for effective clotting. Historically hemophiliacs were treated with plasma-derived products, which meant the bleeding disorder community saw about 90% contamination during the HIV pandemic of the 80s. Today Hemophilia is a multibillion dollar medical industry with my personal medical bills averaging above six figures annually before insurance.

Here is my proof. I also write a comic strip about Hemophilia called Penny For Your Clots!

fpemto,uchealthorg,"I’m Angela Marquez, and I beat cervical cancer. As a result of my cancer treatment, I developed lymphedema, an incurable condition that involves chronic swelling—in my case, in my leg. Ask me anything.","I survived surgery, six weeks of chemo and 35 rounds of radiation to beat cancer. Now, 10 years later, I have a disease there’s no cure for. My lymphedema is a direct result of the surgeries and radiation, because doctors had to remove lymph nodes to test for cancer cells, causing my body’s lymphatic drainage system to stop working properly years later. But I made a decision with this disease that I’m not going to let it define who I am. It’s part of my story, it has turned me into an advocate for lymphedema awareness and I don’t let it get in my way. I maintain an active lifestyle and work out every day, which helps with the chronic swelling I have from lymphedema. 

More than 10 million people in the U.S. and 250 million people worldwide have lymphedema, but few people know about it. That’s why I’ve decided to share my story—the ups and downs, good days and bad days—to help bring awareness to this hard-to-diagnose chronic illness.

fpe5tw,ZAWGURN,"I'm Hector Oseguera, an anti-money laundering attorney running for Congress in New Jersey’s 8th District against the Hudson County political boss. AMA. [xpost r/Political_Revolution]","#[AMA on r/Political_Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/fpdzmz/im_hector_oseguera_an_antimoney_laundering/)
___
I am running for Congress because I’m worried about the future of working class families. Housing, healthcare, and education have become prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the residents in my district, and those are some of the easier issues I aim to tackle. People recognize that corruption is a serious problem that is ruining our democracy, and I want to use the skills I learned as an anti-money laundering analyst to eschew corrupting forces from our government. My platform includes a series of anti-corruption measures aimed at doing just that. As for my opponent, he’s a seminal member of the “Old Boy’s Club” in Hudson County who takes corporate PAC money, is pro-ICE (did I mention this is a predominantly Hispanic community?), and has virtually no presence in the district. I’m Hector Oseguera and I’m running to represent the interests of working-class people.
**I’m Hector Oseguera, and I’m running an anti-corruption campaign for Congress in New Jersey’s 8th district, representing parts of Hudson, Bergen, Union, and Essex county.*\* I’ve been an anti-money laundering attorney for six years, since graduating from New England Law | Boston in 2014. I also studied Political Science, Economics, and Philosophy at Boston University, and volunteered for several federal campaigns including Elizabeth Warren in 2012, Bernie Sanders in 2016, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018.

In my career, I’ve investigated major scandals involving financial malfeasance by economic and political elites, including the [Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/), [Operation Car Wash](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39194395), and the [Russian Laundromat](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/17/deutsche-bank-faces-action-over-20bn-russian-money-laundering-scheme). This experience includes working directly with the Special Agents of the FBI to file Suspicious [Activity Reports](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/what-is-a-suspicious-activity-report) with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, better known as [FinCEN](https://www.fincen.gov/).

I gained valuable insight into the tools used by white collar criminals, organized crime syndicates, and terrorist networks across the globe to hide and launder illegitimate funds. I learned how to follow the money, tracing shell companies in places like the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, and other tax havens to uncover the individuals behind those companies. My investigations go to law enforcement agencies, who use my work to track down and prosecute the individuals behind these financial schemes.

I am a lifelong resident of the district, born in Hoboken (shoutout St. Mary Hospital), and raised in West New York (where my opponent was mayor), and have moved between West New York and Union City (where I live now). The people of the district are tired of the political corruption that is endemic in New Jersey. They are tired of the skyrocketing cost of housing, healthcare, and education. I recall an 8th District where working class families could earn enough to pay the bills and save up for a rainy day from one blue collar job. Now, many two-income households (like mine) find it difficult to get by and enjoy a decent standard of living. My fellow Millenials are deferring marriage, having children, and homeownership due to the crushing burden of student loan debt. We are living through a second Gilded Age where the very few have everything, and the rest of us are told to struggle over crumbs. I decided to run for Congress because we should not accept any of this as normal.

My opponent, Albio Sires, is a fourteen year incumbent who is totally absent from the district. He wasn’t initially elected to the seat, but was a mid-term appointment to fill the seat when Bob Menendez was appointed to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jon Corzine who had been elected Governor of New Jersey. He’s a lifetime member of the New Jersey political “machine,” which is the term used to describe the political establishment. In fourteen years he has never held a town hall, and has said that he never will. He treats his office more like an entitlement than a public service, and exerts total control over the Hudson County political machine. Even for a Congressman, he is notoriously inaccessible. Those who reach out to his office universally report being repeatedly blown off or stood up. Those lucky enough to meet with my opponent or his staff don’t find their meetings to be productive, and few, if any, have gone away satisfied. He has never faced a serious primary challenger, and I aim to change that.

What can I do to end corruption?

My platform includes a comprehensive [Anti-Corruption proposal](https://www.oseguera2020.com/corruption). The centerpiece is a set of reforms I’ve called the Anti-Panama Papers Act, targeting the opaque infrastructure of shell companies that crooks use to launder ill-gotten funds. By leveraging the lessons I’ve learned in my career, I go to the heart of the problem, denying crooks their preferred tool to move illegal money across the globe. I also propose reforms that eliminate the influence of PAC money in our elections by moving to a system of publicly funded elections and drastically reducing the maximum donation limit; as well as pro-democracy reforms aimed at ending gerrymandering, instituting open primaries, and making Election Day a federal holiday.

Finally, I take aim at the system of patronage that has made New Jersey synonymous with political corruption. My proposal bans a practice known as “double-dipping” where individuals hold multiple political jobs at the same time. A good example is my opponent’s District Director, Richard Turner, who also serves as mayor of Weehawen, North Hudson Fire and Rescue’s Chairman, and a “consultant” for the town of West New York, where my opponent was once mayor. My proposal prevents any federal official or employee from simultaneously holding any elected or appointed position in state or local government.

Basically, I do a half day at my high school and then drive about 30 minutes to do the other half of my days at college. At college, I spend about thirty minutes in a classroom and then about 2/3 in a half hours teaching 3,4, and 5 year olds.Most of my students have some sort of intellectual or physical disability, but a lot of my family members have some sort of intellectual delay as well. 

I have formed relationships with many of these kiddos and do a lot of lesson planning for them. If the teacher cannot get them to cooperate, she leaves it up to me. I am usually the one who resolved conflict and helps students that are upset. Because of this, I work really well and have very close friendships with *most* students (will go into detail about that if asked).

I can tell you all great stories about: relationships in preschool, reasoning for kiddos starting fights, how to become friends with them, how to hold conversation, different inside jokes, this one little shit who keeps trying to literally murder me for not giving him an extra string cheese this one time, how teaching has impacted my life, etc etc.

Near the holiday season, it was announced that our store would be closing. The good news is, the new manager gave us all raises. The bad news is, we were closing a lot sooner than anticipated. I thought I'd be here until March, we closed in February. 

My duties involved working in the warehouse, unloading trucks, hanging up clothes on racks, whatever my supervisor wanted me to do. I started out minimum wage, ended up making $11 an hour. And boy, do I wish I had saved more of it.

forpzr,tracywalder,I am a former undercover CIA and FBI agent that went straight from my college sorority to hunting down some of the world’s most wanted terrorists. AMA!,"Hi Reddit! I’m Tracy Walder. I went straight from my college sorority to working undercover for the CIA. My job included hunting al-Qaeda members with drones while President Bush looked over my shoulder and the CIA director brought me donuts. I also tracked chemical terrorists and searched the world for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). While working undercover abroad in countries I can’t name, I debriefed terrorists, ones who swore to never talk to a woman, until they gave me leads. Unfortunately, my chemical terror chart I created was altered by someone in the White House to convey incorrect information that led to the Iraqi invasion.

When I joined the FBI, I worked in counterintelligence. Within my first year, I took down one of the worst spies ever caught on American soil. Sadly, I experienced rampant sexism in the FBI, as many women experience there to this day. I left the FBI to teach history to young women and encourage them to find a place in male-dominated fields, like the CIA, State Department, or Senate, as a way for me to continue to help change the world.

I recently released a book about my life’s story with the help of Jessica Anya Blau. It is called [The Unexpected Spy: From the CIA to the FBI, My Secret Life Taking Down Some of the World's Most Notorious Terrorists](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-unexpected-spy-tracy-walder/1131253996?ean=9781250230980). It was reviewed by the CIA multiple times before they allowed me to publish it (with some information redacted). If you’d like, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tracy_walder) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theunexpectedspy/).

fobrdc,B_Lustmord,I am B. Lustmord. Ask me anything.,"I am B. Lustmord. Ask me anything.

Using sound, I’ve been shining a light on the darkness under the name Lustmord for 40 years.

I was a member of the influential early industrial group SPK, in the 1980's owned and operated the record label Side Effects and also serving as a consultant for Mute Records for their Grey Area sub-label.. 

I’ve worked on over 40 motion pictures, and for television and video games.

Past work utilized source recordings that includes caves, crypts, car crashes, cosmological activity, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the site of the first ever nuclear detonation.   
I perform live as Lustmord around the world at select locations such as disused power stations, mines, churches, film theatre and a cemetery. 

Collaborations include a diverse group of artists including Tool, Melvins, Wes Borland, Nurse With Wound, Paul Haslinger, Clock DVA, Maynard James Keenan, Chris &amp; Cosey and Karin Park amongst many others.   


I am Welsh and lived in central London for ten years before moving to Los Angeles in 1993.

I’ll try and answer anything asked but I may miss a few questions.  
I don’t believe in such a thing as a stupid question, but there are some things that I’m just tired of answering and for those you’re better served by just doing a quick search online.  
Note that I’m dyslexic, so factor that with my spelling when reading my responses. If you have problem with that I really don’t care.

AMA about the Lost Cause, Civil War Memory, Confederate monuments, and any thing else about the Civil War and Reconstruction in General.""","#[Link to AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fo6f43/im_dr_adam_h_domby_author_of_the_false_cause/)

Hello, everyone, I am Adam Domby, an historian of the Civil War and Reconstruction at the College of Charleston. I'm an expert on Civil War memory (including Confederate monuments) here to answer your questions about the Civil War and more specifically my new book:The False Cause: Fraud, Fabrication, and White Supremacy in Confederate Memory (UVA Press) available through your favorite book seller. Here is the overview:

&gt;The Lost Cause ideology that emerged after the Civil War and flourished in the early twentieth century in essence sought to recast a struggle to perpetuate slavery as a heroic defense of the South. As Adam Domby reveals here, this was not only an insidious goal; it was founded on falsehoods. The False Cause focuses on North Carolina to examine the role of lies and exaggeration in the creation of the Lost Cause narrative. In the process the book shows how these lies have long obscured the past and been used to buttress white supremacy in ways that resonate to this day.

&gt;Domby explores how fabricated narratives about the war’s cause, Reconstruction, and slavery—as expounded at monument dedications and political rallies—were crucial to Jim Crow. He questions the persistent myth of the Confederate army as one of history’s greatest, revealing a convenient disregard of deserters, dissent, and Unionism, and exposes how pension fraud facilitated a myth of unwavering support of the Confederacy among nearly all white Southerners. Domby shows how the dubious concept of ""black Confederates"" was spun from a small number of elderly and indigent African American North Carolinians who got pensions by presenting themselves as ""loyal slaves."" The book concludes with a penetrating examination of how the Lost Cause narrative and the lies on which it is based continue to haunt the country today and still work to maintain racial inequality.

I'll be back around noon to start answering questions so ask away! I look forward to answering questions about Confederate monuments, desertion, dissent, the myth of ""black Confederates,"" pension fraud, racism and Jim Crow era politics, Confederate nationalism, and why we forget so much about the past.",2,1585061984,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fo6hrd/askhistorians_xpost_i_am_dr_adam_h_domby_author/,IAmA,1

**Topic:** There is an appalling lack of coordinated crowd-based (or self-reported) data collection initiates related to COVID-19. Currently, if coronavirus tests are negative, there is no mandatory reporting to the CDC...meaning many valuable datapoints are going uncollected. I am currently reaching out to government groups and politicians to help put forth a database with Public Health in mind. We created https://aitia.app and want to encourage widespread submission of datapoints for all people, healthy or not. With so many infectious diseases presenting symptoms in similar ways, we need to collect more baseline data so we can better understand the public health implications of the coronavirus.

fnpch3,robgreenfieldreddit,I only ate food that I grew or foraged for one year: Rob Greenfield AMA,"Hello Reddit!
Rob Greenfield here. I recently finished a yearlong project of growing and foraging 100% of my food.
Last month an interview I did with BuzzFeed about my project was on the front page of r/videos and I saw that there were a lot of questions. I've decided to do an AMA to answer them!
So please ask me anything!

[Here's a YouTube playlist of videos from the project:]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4kq4QfYRA&amp;list=PLHrhas5pE0W47hLTW9N5bu5R42n9UeHzx)

A bit more about the project:
For one year I grew and foraged 100% of my food.
Every. Single. Bite.
No grocery stores, no restaurants, not even a drink at a bar.
Nature was my garden, my pantry and my pharmacy.
I lived in the city of Orlando, Florida in a 100 square foot tiny house. With no land of my own I turned front yards into gardens and shared the bounty of food with the homeowners. Over the year I grew over 100 different foods in my gardens, foraged over 200 foods from nature and I grew and foraged my own medicine and vitamins too. The purpose wasn't just to grow my own food, but to do something attention grabbing to create a conversation about the reality of our food system and inspire and instigate people to take back control of our food from Big Ag and create food sovereignty in our communities.

Prior to this, I had had some experience building conventional off-grid houses for a number of friends and, having seen how costly, high-maintenance and error-prone these systems were (most of those friends went back on-grid after only a few years), I decided I wanted to try and find better approaches to off-grid technology. 

Today our community (it's called Living Energy Farm, you can find our website here: livingenergyfarm.org) has twelve members, including children. We are currently completely energy self-sufficient on the residential level, using a setup that has been running with very low maintenance costs (both in terms of time and money) for many years. 

There are two key ways in which our system differs from conventional off-grid technology. The first is that we primarily store energy in forms other than electricity, allowing us to function with much smaller solar panel rigs than are possible with conventional systems. Our solar space heating system is a good example of this. Rather than have a solar panel connected to a large battery bank and run a space heater off of that battery bank, or keep a wood stove running constantly, we heat our house during the winter with passive solar and a combination of solar thermal hot air collectors and DC blowers that are connected directly to our solar electric panels. On a sunny day the solar hot air collectors heat air, which the blowers then push under the floor so the heat can radiate up through the house. To make the most of this heat we have a heavily insulated house (our walls are around a foot thick, insulated with straw bales) that cools very slowly, allowing us to stay warm even after multiple days without enough sun to run our blowers. The entire heating system operates without any electricity needing to run through a battery or inverter, which allows us to get away with much lower battery capacity than other off-grid systems. We run many tools directly off our solar electric panels, such as a winnowing fan, grain grinder, drill press, metal-cutting lathe, belt grinder, air compressor, to name a few. We refer to the way in which our equipment runs primarily off of a solar electric panel as Daylight Drive. 

The second way in which our system differs is that where we do use batteries to store electricity, we do so for things that run at lower voltages, and we use nickel iron (NiFe) batteries. Nickel iron batteries have some disadvantages in certain circumstances, but for our purposes they work incredibly well. Compared to the battery types used in more conventional off-grid systems they are incredibly robust (they can be discharged with minimal loss in their functionality; I even have one made 70 years ago that can still hold a charge pretty well) and also have much lower maintenance costs (once every month I have to add some distilled water to our batteries and once every five to ten years I will have to replace the electrolyte in them, but other than that they run without any real maintenance on our part). For lighting we use DC bulbs that can run direct off our batteries with no inverters, and for charging phones and laptops we have cigarette lighter outlets (the kind you find in a car) so we can charge our devices without the need for inverters as well. Because we have no inverters and only use batteries to power a small range of devices, we can get away with a much smaller and (most importantly!) cheaper battery bank than would be possible with a conventional off-grid setup. 

Part of why our system has worked so well for us is because of both a willingness to adjust our lifestyles to the amount of energy that we can use, and because of cooperative use. Using our system we have access to many of the comforts of a modern American home (eg. I can take a hot shower or surf the internet whenever I want, and our lights have never gone out in all the years we have been here) but we still need to pay attention to our energy use. For example, when we go through a long spell of cloudy weather we cannot leave the sink running all day or run all of our shop tools. We actually find this to be advantage however, as it means the system incentivizes us to live and use electricity in a more deliberate and conservationist way. Conventional energy systems on the other hand incentivize people to not be mindful of the amount of electricity they use. 

Cooperative use means that we have technology scaled for a small village or community rather than an individual home. While our systems would likely be prohibitively expensive in terms of per capita cost for many individual families throughout the world (though they are far, far cheaper both in terms of initial investment costs and ongoing maintenance costs!), the per capita cost becomes much more affordable when distributed among a small community or village. Cooperative use also results in a more effective energy system, in the sense that it is  less resource-intensive to heat one large building that houses three families than it is to heat three small individual homes. Because we are an intentional community, cooperative use for us means that our systems support several different families and individuals, but it could just as easily mean supporting the same number of cohabitating friends, one multigenerational family household, or several single generational families. The per capita effectiveness is a result of the number of people sharing the system and not how many of the people are or are not related.

We also grow most of our own food. Out of our 127 acres we farm around five acres, growing both staple crops for feeding the community as well as seeds, which we sell for income. The farm is USDA certified organic and we are currently experimenting with several different farming techniques that we hope will be more sustainable than modern, commercial organic agriculture. Some of these include chemical-free no-till farming, and grafting commercial fruit tree varieties onto rootstock that is growing natively.

There are some areas in which we are still trying to improve our energy systems. The first is our cooking system, which currently involves cooking on wood-fired rocket stoves. We are experimenting with biogas and Daylight Drive electric hotplates. Another area is our agricultural technology. We currently still burn fossil fuels to run our tractors, though we are experimenting with running one on pine pitch (turpentine).  

We also very recently have returned from a trip to Arizona where we installed several dozen of our off-grid DC-powered nickel-iron lighting kits for families in the Navajo and Hopi nations and trained several people in the installation and maintenance of our systems. Many Navajo and Hopi families have had more conventional off-grid technology (eg. using AC power and lead-acid batteries) installed in the past which have since stopped working. We are confident that our lighting systems will prove to be as reliable and long-lasting for these families as they have been for us.

fnm9gn,lancelotschaubert,I am a novelist writing on the hilarious history of carpenters in Southern Illinois who took on Big Oil using pranks and jokes. Editor of The Showbear Family Circus. Artist chaplain in NYC raising relief funds for gigging artists out of work in coronavirus — Lancelot Schaubert — AMA!,"[Proof.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SydGXxsLG4rptee1wyyHa6qt0jMtgofu/view?usp=sharing)

HEYO! 

Friendly neighborhood Lancelot here, Ask Me Anything! I’m a debut novelist writing about [Little Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois) — what other folk call “Southern Illinois,” its backstory with the [Herrin Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrin_massacre), its relation to the [coal wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Wars), and how all of that got exacerbated when Big Oil got involved. It's an economic reality that keeps the region oppressed even to this day. I accidentally discovered upon interviewing my grandpas that they “should have gotten an attorney” multiple times in run-ins with various companies, but they continued to respond with humor and pranks. 

BELL HAMMERS is the name of the novel. As of today, you can enter a [Goodreads giveaway for red wax monogrammed hardbacks](https://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/show/305209-bell-hammers) or get a sample of the eBook [here.](https://mailchi.mp/lanceschaubert.org/bell-hammers)

I also run a literary journal called The Showbear Family Circus that focuses on the liberal arts and virtue — [here on Submittable for those of you creating things during quarantine.](https://showbears.submittable.com/submit)

# Most importantly we’re raising funds for [relief grants for gigging artists in NYC.](https://artistsforcommunity.givingfuel.com/starlings)

My main job is as an artist chaplain here in NYC: I make it easier for people to make what they’re called to make. As of this writing, NY has 16,900 of the 35,000 coronavirus cases. The city is full of 300,000 people making an average of $80,000 per year in the arts. Before the virus, we had another 9,000 artists unemployed **and countless others either working in shadow careers or who had stopped seeking unemployment benefits.** With the theaters closed, we have tons of folks out of gigs and commissions. We’d love to put them to work with coronvirus-oriented commissions. Sign up for regular contributions [here.](https://artistsforcommunity.givingfuel.com/starlings)

I’ll answer questions until they stop coming in — in my view, a true Ask Me Anything allows any question at any time and tries to answer them all. However, I invoke the Pat Rothfuss rule and have three stipulations:

1. I reserve the right to defer to someone of greater expertise than me when I can.
2. I reserve the right to lie, bullshit, or make up a tall tale
3. I reserve the right to answer with jokes or sarcasm
4. That said, I’ll try to be honest and forthcoming wherever law and morals permit

	6.	When I spend an entire night erecting a military encampment in my friend [Mark 9’s](http://www.marknphoto.com/) front yard and then he’s not home and the house sitter has to clean it all up and the house sitter is my sister and she’s really mad and takes my Christmas presents back to the store even though it’s June cause she buys all her presents early and the Christmas present was more tents and spits for wild boar so that I could erect a military encampment in my friend Mark9's front yard (this has happened at least 4 times)
	7.	Christmas Trees that only stay up for the Western Christmas and not the Eastern Christmas — WE KNOW WHAT YOU’RE HIDING, TREES
	8.	Ending lists on a 10
	9.	Lists in general, why did I do this
	10.	Matt Otey showing up in my AMAs.
	11.	Lists of ten that end in eleven

fnc87j,Sluthaterinfinite,"I have realized if you're male and looks are sub par, you're not built, and/ or short ( 5'6 and under) then your personality doesn't mean shit so may as well act however you want. I choose low effort treating women, and people in general like shit.","
I never realized this when I was younger ( middle school/ high school) I guess because I did have females come up and talk to me at least albeit rarely/ grab my ass once. I also had the popular people at my school offer me to sit at their table once, I'm guessing because I was so antisocial and they probably felt bad for me as I pretty much always sat alone by choice ( yes it was by choice, I would scout out areas other people were not/ were not likely to be and go there on breaks, etc..). I did notice however some of my friends women woupd come up to and be excited to see, and then notice me and say "" hey"" as monotone as possible. In college my female attention I was getting dropped pretty much to zero other than dirty looks and butchy attitudes. At this point I decided personally that whores would get minimal effort from me in any regard.

It wasnt until I tried online dating that I realized I am ugly and short and these are the only reasons women hate me. For example, I went to best buy with my friend to buy some video games ( he is 5'9 and has recently been hitting the gym but has always been good looking and dorky) these two foids come up to us ( something that would never happen if I were alone) and start trying to chat "" us"" up. I could see through their weak facade of both wanting to fuck my friend "" Chad"" hence coming over to us and so ignored them and fucked around on my phone until they fucked off. Of course this didn't bother them because they were both after Chad cock anyway.

The point of this long winded post is that if you are a low tier male in terms of looks ( I know I'm ugly because of my experience with online dating/ hook up sites), height, and build then there is no reason to treat women like anything other than the shit they are. It won't hurt your chances of getting laid as they most likely wouldn't fuck you anyway based on your looks, height, etc...

fnack7,Inneradio,I am Goldfish: the creator of inneRadio and the Bumblebee Rebellion - AMA,"https://voca.ro/i6jFYvytycd

It may seem the world is on a cliff-edge right now: some reasons more personal than others. 

Well, I'm here to tell you that it's not. 

In April, 2019, I discovered something called ReSpace: a growing network of people being given permission to use empty buildings to challenge rising waste and inequality. 

More about them can be found [here](http://Uk.respaceprojects.org)

Why? 

The idea is that by sharing space with people who wouldn't normally have access to it can lead to innovative projects that don't have to measure their success in profit.

The ZER0 LDN project:

For the past 9 months Gillett Square has been home to everything from sustainable fashion designers, eco-businesses, activist groups, and those exploring alternative therapy. 

In exchange for their workspace these people were involved in a series of community events, as well as the opportunity to discuss the local and global issues of today with like minded collaborators. 

The Bumblebee Rebellion:

Upon discovering Extinction Rebellion in early February, 2019, it became apparent that the many I spoke with knew very little about the possibilities of Discord, let alone understand what I went through growing up feeling deeply isolated, traumatised, and on 
/b/ of all places (that's why I've got no post history. Sorry not sorry!) 

The one I started making for inneRadio in October 2018 has gone through a lot of change and never would I have thought that it'd become home to a movement support group. 

Among other things, XR UK is currently working on a 'People's Assembly' that can hold the government accountable for their actions. 

I feel its important to do just the same, but with bustling Discord communities that can speak for the diversity of planet Earth, as well as reassure the many going through a kind of pain that still haunts me today. 

Ours is an example of a SFW community that has no intention of censoring people, but more so encouraging them to really think before they write. 

You also have the choice to PM Bumblebees ('mods') for advice on personal matters, whereas PMing anyone else without their consent is strictly forbidden.

inneRadio:

This is a public awareness project that seeks to unlock any one person's potential for change through art, music, and other people speaking about their journey. 

One day we will have the team and community required to create podcasts, Monday to Friday, as well as let people know about our efforts through stickers, posters, and more.. 

There is a simple checklist that we must follow for this to happen, starting with the following:

Voices of the World is basically a library of reassuring conversations had by people (like you!) speaking about the past, present, and future.. 

A successful Kickstarter. Never liked talking about money, definitely a conversation for later. 

For anyone who wants this to make more sense I strongly suggest exploring our Discord which can be found [here](https://discord.gg/aKHRAMP)

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent the last two years working on the development of a multiplayer space game with my brother. I only do this part time and haven't really lost anything financially, but I sunk a lot of my time and passion into this game. Honestly, I expected a lot more people to be more excited about it when I started, but as time wore on, I began to realize that I was competing with a lot of high budget studios that can afford to make better art than we can. I mostly still work on this project to keep myself occupied and to learn new things.

I think the main reason it failed (despite me offering it for free) is that when we first released it, there was really not enough people to keep a game going and really no way to play it on your own. I tried to fix that later by making bots, but all the launch hype was already gone (Wow, this is starting to sound a lot more depressing than I intended).

This game was developed using Unity game engine and C#. So if you have any questions about either of those, I'd be happy to answer them. Despite everything, I've had a lot of fun making this project and I don't regret starting it. I think I've learned quite a bit, and if there's anything I can pass on, I'd welcome the questions!

___

When the United Nations High Commission for Refugees placed my single mother, four siblings, and myself in Beaverton, Oregon without money or experience navigating life in the U.S., I took a lead role at age 14 in helping my family plant our roots. I volunteered at the library to learn English, practicing everyday while reshelving children’s books and finding English-language TV shows and movies to take home. I needed language skills to help my family compile endless documents and applications while my mother struggled with PTSD. We lived in a small apartment depending on social services, so I translated documents to apply for benefits to keep us afloat. My older siblings went to work and I started contributing as soon as I could. During our first several years in the U.S., living without a car, we spent hours walking or on public transit. Throughout my life, I have labored in countless service and retail jobs. My first job in the U.S. was a courtesy clerk at a grocery store. Since then, I have been a receptionist, a cashier, a waitress, a pharmacy technician, an office assistant, a temp, a fast food worker, and a visual merchandiser. These experiences taught me that cooperation, hard work, and ingenuity are necessary to survive in the working class.

In 2006, we moved to Northern Virginia to be closer to family. The hard times were not over. In high school, educators did not invest in putting me on a path toward college. I was a high-achieving student working multiple jobs and had to navigate the convoluted admissions process independently. At the same time, my family had finally purchased our first house right before the 2008 financial crisis. We were the victims of predatory loans and our mortgage payments skyrocketed. Nearly everyone in my family worked at least two jobs to try to pay the bills, but it was still not enough. While the U.S. government approved a Wall Street bailout, we lost everything and had to start over.

When I had multiple jobs to put myself through college, I believed that I was moving toward the “American Dream” that our country sells to us and the world. I realized pursuing this dream came at a cost. After working full-time through community college and holding part-time jobs while finishing my degree at public university, I finally became the first person in my family to graduate. However, $50,000 in student loan debt, no privileged connections, and a Muslim name made the job hunt a struggle. I couldn’t afford to pursue my dreams, and I didn’t have the access to “chase the money.” Like so many other people of my generation, I felt completely hopeless and helpless. To support others who were also struggling, I invested myself in community service.

Two terms of AmeriCorps service at a non-profit focused on educational equity sounded like a way to support students with similar experiences. The purpose of the organization was to help low-income students who wanted to go to college. During my time as a counselor, I developed strong bonds with high schoolers who faced many of the same struggles as I did. However, I came to see that the difficulties we faced couldn’t be solved only by community service. There are structural issues in the U.S. that make it extraordinarily difficult for first-generation, low-income students, and People of Color to navigate higher education. I turned toward community activism to make larger changes that could affect millions with stories like mine.

I have worked to elect Democrats, believing that our political system can bring tangible change. I’ve pounded the pavement as a canvasser. In speaking with constituents, I learned that our neighbors were experiencing the same challenges my family faced. People struggled with thousands in student debt, poor health coverage, discrimination, and escaping the cycle of poverty. I heard time and again that these people had never been canvassed before.

These experiences made me realize we need more representation for people who work for a living. Part of the reason our communities face obstacles is because we don’t have a seat at the table. When our representatives use their positions to become millionaires by investing hundreds of thousands of their personal money into industries that donate to their campaigns, our entire political system becomes a revolving door for the rich and powerful. The future of the Democratic Party is a bold, progressive platform that engages diverse communities and serves everyone. That's why I'm putting forth an agenda of immigrant justice, educational equity, and racial and social justice.

As someone with deep experience as a working class community activist, I know that I’m ready to lead us to a more equitable future. My personal and professional experiences are my strength because I know what it’s like to survive systems of war, poverty, and discrimination. The creativity, resilience, intelligence, and empathy that I’ve gained from my struggles and advocacy will make me a skilled representative. I will always center the marginalized and fight for justice.

fn05wq,Dr_Varun,I am a Family Doctor in the UK with a Youtube channel trying to help people with their mental health. I hope I can be of help especially now. AMA,"My name is Dr Varun Mudigonda and I work as a Family Doctor in Wolverhampton in England (one of the largest hit areas with Covid-19 after London)

I've been scared and intimidated like everyone else but I just have to do everything I can for my patients and my team and I hope I'm doing the right things.

I have a Youtube channel which gives advice and support for mental health issues and I am more than happy to try and live stream most nights (UK time) for any questions or support especially for those who cant afford to, or cant get to a doctor. 

I can't guarantee I will know all the answers but I am certainly happy to do my best if people are keen for it. At times like this, perhaps it could help a few people so please let me know!

Huge thanks for taking the time to join my AMA!

I’m currently out of work indefinitely as all the theatres I work at have shut down thanks to coronavirus (yaaay). I’m also self-isolating and bored so here I am!

fmbnhb,thefakekiwi,"I am currently quarantined in a Government facility in Vietnam with 2 other people, my wife and our roommate and new friend we just met yesterday, AMA","We are 1 male, Scottish, my wife, 1 female, American and 1 female, Ukrainian. We have all lived and worked in Vietnam for 4+ years. 

We arrived on the same flight to Vietnam last night an hour before 00:00 of the 21st March 2020. This is important in terms of the ever changing rules we are facing that no one seems quite sure about. 

My wife and I left Vietnam 12 days ago for what was supposed to be a truly spectacular whirlwind 3 weddings in 3 weeks on 3 continents trip - starting in New Zealand, to the U.S. and back to Vietnam. Unfortunately, no less than 2 days after our departure, covid-19 was confirmed as a pandemic and rapid spread in the US and Europe meant that the virus started crossing borders very quickly... including to New Zealand. 

We soon knew that our whirlwind trip was not going to be what we thought it was and started making quick and constantly changing plans and flight arrangements to come home, to Vietnam. Every day we woke up to new rules and had to change something or do something else to try and get back in.

The full story is too long to share here, but after we thought we would be sharing time with our loved ones in different parts of the world, seeing new marriages being formed, and celebrating with our family and friends, we had to leave before the first wedding even took place and the other two have sadly been postponed. Whatever is necessary to make the world safe right now. 

Now, on the day of wedding #1, we find ourselves in government quarantine in Vietnam. Apart from being bused to an old dormitory building that students belongings were moved out of yesterday and that it’s outfitted with army supplies, I’m not entirely sure what I’m in for. But we’ll be here for the next 14 days.

Next Saturday, would’ve been wedding #2 in the US and the Saturday after that would’ve been wedding #3. That’s the day we’ll get out of government quarantine.

So we don't have much to do either! So AMA to any of us!!

fm9gwo,AnbIlQ912,I'm a multimillionaire by inheritance.,"Hey guys.
So I made this account in order not to reveal anything about my identity so I thought I will do this AMA.
A little about me my family is worth 3billion dollars. I have 1 brother and one sister, and I happen to be the youngest. My father worked a lot during his youth but he too inherited a lot of the money. So it's basically a family that has been working for around 6 to 7 generations and we reached 3 billion dollars recently. Anyways my father is 60 and he decided o retire. He sold plenty of shares he used to own. my brother and I received around 600M dollars in assets and cash . My sister received the most (700M).
He helped me invest the cash, and I actually invested it all in luxury real estate and I make plenty of money right now just by sitting on the couch. However believe it or not I do have a job which I love and it's in teaching. I teach middle school kids in a school where I earn 25K per year. No one knows I have this much amount of money but they all know I have a comfortable life.
I do travel a lot, ONe of the perks of my job is that I hae summer vacations of which I use it to travel the world. Until now I traveled up to 150 countries. 

I don't consider myself spoiled. You can ask me anything and I'll be happy to answer but I won't give personal details.",1,1584765478,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fm9gwo/im_a_multimillionaire_by_inheritance/,IAmA,1

age 1-2 could speak fairly well, age 3-4 autism wiped out my understanding of language and made me fairly insane, i was badly bullied by the local hawaiian kids for being a howly so we moved to oregon. somewhere around this time i became agnostic and learned about evolution. being agnostic came first i think.

Age 5 im addicted to computers, my father cheated on my mom with a 13 year old we let stay with us (i'm not sure if adopted is the right word for our situation), he was mentally abusive to her (he went to prison for 7 years but was let out in 6), i mentally woke up around this point to some degree as that's when my memory started getting more active because i became depressed (my sister and mom didn't tell me my dad wasnt what you would call a good person) , i noticed myself getting bullied in elementary school, got into medieval history, scifi, and fantasy and could read at a highschool level, developed anger issues, i was abusive to my sister(lended around high school), i was smart enough to realise that becoming a school shooter was a bad idea but it became a hobby to fantasize about it by third grade, learned how to cycle at some point. understood the basic value of exercise (10 push ups maybe 30 curls and lots of running).

changed schools, got into survival books around this time partly because i wanted to run away became home was super boring when i didn't have books or internet access. got glasses. got a ex cop step dad around this time.

(this section gets more space because its one of the few notable memories which later made me a better human (still an ambivert rather than an introvert nowadays)) moved and started middle school near a paper mill in portland, got a younger ""gf"", ghosted her soon after out of fear of dating a girl 4 years my junior, dated a blonde who was taller than me, she barely talked to me and i didnt know how to talk to her, we got together because i was really indecisive and kept saying maybe maybe not to stall for time because i couldn't tell her i couldn't return her feeling yet, i told folks we accidentally got together without explaining that i wanted to give the relationship a chance because no one asked, i experienced a short period of popularity and barely wanted to be violent, i told a guy next to me and he went to tell her, she gave me a look, i tried to talk to her later but she ignored me and eventually i gave up and just kept sending guilty looks her way when we passed in the hall or i avoided looking at her.

still the same middle school: read enough books that i considered working out to carry more books(i could always read VERY quickly). started running outside for exercise a bit but the smoke from the factory became an excuse.

moved, did an extra year of middle school due to the school having an extra year for everyone. dated a girl for a while, i broke up with her because i knew i wouldn't be able to fall in love with her without forcing myself.

highschool:

freshman year started reading a lot more digital books and such (used to hate it), started intensively surfing the internet, got into stoicism meditation zen and such.

sophomore year learned about extreme minimalism, barefoot running ,fasting, ""early retirement extreme"", allan savory, the wim hof method, carnivore diet and such. Had something akin to the western form of zen enlightenment while i was walking back from the water fountain.  basically my autism symptoms reduced a ton, my anger issues reduced a ton, more empathy, more outgoing, felt what beauty was for what may have been the first time outside of it being a concept, ect. started cycling a few miles to and from school most days, cycled during winter with socks and flip flops, flip flops and shorts were basically my uniform with a couple of jackets that are maybe 5-15 pounds in total.

my junior year was basically me becoming a hippy and confirming that the above was legit (i'm not into urine drinking, conspiracy theories voodoo or anything that cant be explained by science (unless you count hoping that infinite realities are a thing))

senior year i became ""social"" and asked out most of the girls in my class off a dare and the girls i had crushes on. became semi popular/known with the help of once per year fights from middle school + my last one in high school where i nearly beat the sense out of a kid nicknamed cheeto via meditating the whole day to do it. he asked me if i wanted to fight near the middle of the year and i thought about it and just casually said ""sure"". built a reputation as a self proclaimed hippy and argued with my plant sci teacher bout a few things mostly biomass (i had an A+ with her and an A or B with my vet sci teacher (went to vet sci because the other ag class would teach me about conventional agriculture which i can learn about on my own.

graduated with a mix of a's b's c's and maybe a d or two somewhere.

worked at the local farms for 2 summers during high school and for a short time after graduation until I worked for the northwest youth corps for a month(10/10 in work ethic is too high their standards are too low i was being lazy! ). now im unemployed until i work for my step grandpa next month taking care of the fields getting some livestock for my parents, clearing the lower branches of the timber to improve visibility and such, maybe plant some trees and change the seed mix for the fields... so many blackberries and poison oak i ignore even though i react haha.

so yeah ask me anything! =)

Please forgive my subpar formatting, I'm posting this from mobile.

I'm posting this here as well as r/aldi, there are some good questions there at the moment. I don't know how to x-post, and am not going to dive into how right now. 

Hello, as the title says I've been working for Aldi for 4 years now (it'll be 5 in a few more months!) 

Given the state of things right now, I wanted to take a moment to thank all of you loyal Aldi shoppers, as well as answer any questions you might have. 

Seriously, you guys have been the best. This week has been crazy busy, but almost every single person I've encountered has been so kind and understanding. Me, and all of us that work for Aldi appreciate it. Your simple ""Thank you for being here"" or ""you guys are doing great"" do more for our morale than you think. 

But, all that said, this has been a taxing time for all of us. I know it, you know it, and the higher-ups at Aldi know it as well. They recently enacted a $2/hour pay bump for all employees, and have (from what I've seen) been increasingly flexible regarding when people cant make it in because of child care, or health concerns. 

In regards to health/cleanliness, we stepped up our cleaning like a week ago as this was all getting real in my area. We have more time alloted to clean per day, with certain tasks that are done: 

-constantly =Washing/sanitizing hands between transactions =disinfecting the order divider sticks

-hourly =disinfecting card readers

-5 times daily =disinfecting all door handles =disinfecting cart handles 

-daily =disinfecting store equipment (the bread dollies, jack handles, walkie talkies, all that stuff)

All of these are the minimums we currently have. I know at my location, we try to wipe every cart handle when swapping carts, as well as the card readers when it isn't a contactless payment. 

Tips: 

-If able, be at the store when it opens. The truck ~should~ be fully worked, and as long as you ask nicely, we are happy to check on whatever hasn't been done yet. 

-When loading your cart onto the checkout belt, start with your large and heavy items. (Gallons of milk, juice, 10lb bags of potatoes) followed by boxes of frozen goods. They stack nicely, and wre typically not going to be damaged by things like cans which I would recommend putting up next. (When everything calms back down, and you can buy entire flats of cans, or youre getting flats now put full flats up first). Qfter cans I would put things like cheese, glass jars, and butter. The stuff you don't want to break but can handle some hard knocks. After that, your fragile stuff. Produce, bread, chips, and eggs. Try to group everything as much as possible, and I personally don't mind having split cases of cans, especially if you take the time to let me know. 

-Bring a quarter. Please. If you don't, please ask a cashier for one. If they deny you one, PLEASE escalate. I know it can be hard to navigate with a cart when it's busy, but if you have more than 1 bag worth of stuff it's going to slow us down at the front end. (This is as much a tip as it is a plea for help) and please, dont ask to just ""borrow the cart for a second"" If you need a cart, just get one. We do need all of the carts we have uo front, and when we see an order that we know will clog the line we offer ours. 

FAQ: Q: What days do you get shipments? A: Most stores get trucks in every day, and we try to have everything out before store open. To find out for sure, ask a team member at your favorite location.

Q: When are you getting TP, sanitizer, wipes etc. back in? A: That depends. At my store, we've been getting toilet paper in most days. Usually a pallet of one of the higher volume sellers, and about 15 units of the big 30 roll packages. It all depends on how much your stores warehouse has/had on hand. For sanatizer, wipes, and all that? It'll probably be awhile. The folks who make those are busy beyond belief just trying to keep up with the medical industry's needs. 

Q: Why don't you have the milk I like? A: I was told the dairy industry made the decision to focus on the highest volume milks like 2%, so skim and 1% may be harder to find. We are still receiving them, but not in the quantities we are ordering. 

Q: Why should I believe anything you have to say? What do you know? A: I am just a shift manager, but I have a pretty solid understanding of how Aldi runs. I hate telling you guys no or that we don't have something as much as you hate to hear it. 

Q: Wow, has the world gone crazy or something? You guys have been wiped out! A: I guess so, I'm sorry we didn't have what you needed today.

‐---------------------

I wanted to share all of this because I know many of you are as unsure of what comes next as we are, but we are trying to do what we can to make this a little easier. I'm sure I'm coming off as a shill, but I love working for Aldi. So, sorry for rambling, but AMA. I can't answer specific questions regarding sales numbers and the like, but am happy to answer anything else.

I’m Joshua Collins.  I’m 26, &amp; I’ve been a truck driver for 5 years.  I was running in Washington's 10th Congressional District against Denny Heck.  He announced he was dropping out &amp; retiring in December. We raised $25k in the 48 hours after he dropped out, &amp; since then, we’ve broken $200k. Washington is a free for all, best of 2 primary so if I come top 2 in the Primary, it would be the top 2 from any parties running in the general.  As of right now, I’m the front-runner, with the most individual donations (no PAC money), the most volunteers, &amp; the most media coverage.  Our primary is an 18-day mail-in ballot period that starts July 17th &amp; ends August 4th.  So Aug 4th is the last day to vote for me in Washington’s 10th.

I’d also be the first openly autistic member of Congress, if elected.  You can read an article about that here: [https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/accessibility/475331-candidate-seeks-to-become-the-first-openly-autistic](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/accessibility/475331-candidate-seeks-to-become-the-first-openly-autistic)

I’ve used Social media to build the whole campaign.  With almost all my donations, volunteers, staffers, interviews, &amp; other advantages coming from my use of Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, &amp; Facebook.  We’ve shifted all our focus into online &amp; phonebanking since the COVID-19 crisis, as all in-person events have to be cancelled.

My Democratric Party opponents are:

1. Marilyn Strickland, the CEO of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce
2. Kristine Reeves, who stepped down from a State Legislative seat in Federal way to run, &amp; is an executive for the Washington Military Alliance
3. Phil Gardner, an ex Denny Heck staffer who is also a big Buttigieg supporter
4. Beth Doglio, who announced late &amp; is a sitting state Rep, &amp; in her last filing had taken fossil fuel money

I recently founded the Rent Strike 2020 movement, with over 2 million people signing on to our demands for a rent &amp; utility freeze during the COVID-19 crisis.  You can follow that on Facebook &amp; Twitter @  rentstrike2020, &amp; the website is  [https://www.rentstrike2020.org/](https://www.rentstrike2020.org/)   We’re working with Rose Caucus &amp; Socialist Alternative on that.  Rose Caucus is a slate of Socialist candidates for Fed &amp; State office, who all align with the same 230+ radical policies, publicly identify as Socialists, all have endorsed Bernie, &amp; all pledge never to pay DCCC dues.  I'm a founding member of Rose Caucus &amp; y'all can check them out at [http://www.rosecaucus.com](http://www.rosecaucus.com)

You can see all of my listed policies at [https://www.joshua2020.com/platform](https://www.joshua2020.com/platform).

We're also doing a virtual town hall on Sunday, this is the link to the Facebook event with all the info, [https://www.facebook.com/events/540146793279113/](https://www.facebook.com/events/540146793279113/)  , feel free to attend!

flya7u,Furious_Rexx,Chewy Pharmacy," \~Introduction\~  

Recently, I stumbled across a social post written by a former co-worker. I think it is important to share this information with as many consumers as possible. In this post, it is my goal to take employee testimonies from various people that I used to work with (From early 2019 to early 2020) and do my best to elaborate and expand them based on experiences. The information I am going to provide has led to vicious attacks by the company to hide UNSAFE practices during this trying time. In an attempt to get help and protect an exemplary workforce of remarkable people, I would like this information to reach AS MANY ears as possible.  

To provide a little background, I used to work for the pet company (Chewy.com) as a pharmacy technician. Many of my former co-workers, as well as myself, LOVED the work culture provided at this company. We have bleeding hearts for our pet parents, their fur-babies, and the relationships that were built as a team to provide the best customer experience to that is possible. In an attempt to be transparent, it is not my intention to provide the illusion that I am a remarkable person, or that I follow all the rules, or even that I could be considered a poster-boy. That being said I know for a fact that I (and my former coworkers) CARE.  

For all of you that may not be aware, Chewy as a company went public on the NYSE sometime between May and June of 2019. Since this public offering came to fruition there have been many attempts to continue to develop ""best work practices"" (at least within the pharmacy department in which we work(ed)). This statement, in my opinion, is more than reasonable for any company. What is not reasonable is for Chewy to disguise their disregard for the care of their workforce with ""positive growth and changes"".   

\~Pre-Section 1 \~ Historical example of how Chewy Pharmacy has handled outbreaks in the past \~ 

As almost a forewarning to current events. Chewy Pharmacy last some had an outbreak of sorts. This outbreak was not necessarily an illness, but it could be argued that it shares aspects of being a contagion of sorts. I am of course speaking about one of my personal biggest fears. BEDBUGS. Over roughly 6 months (spring/summer 2019), Chewy Pharmacy became infested with Bedbugs from an unnamed new employee. Although I do not know that person personally, it is well known that after an investigation, this person was let go for the transmission of the vile little creatures. Outside of this (possible?) wrongful termination, the handling of extermination needs by leadership was proven to be extremely slow-moving (*A piss poor effort on their part).* Their lack of urgency paired with the inability to follow recommended professional guidelines unknowingly gave hints to the capabilities of the company to handle the current guidelines provided for our current growing health epidemic. (*I will further explain this later in this collaboration.)* 

\~Section 1 \~ Explanation of changes after Chewy IPO \~ 

Before getting into recent events (I.e. - COVID-19), I would like to briefly mention the changes that had been made following the company going public. (Please remember that I am mainly referring to instances within the Pharmacy). At the start of Chewy going public, we all noticed what I like to call and ""Amazon-style"" corporate takeover. For any of you all that are not sure what this means I will explain. In the past, I worked for a company that was bought out by Amazon. During a shift change on the date of the company officially switching hands, all of the former managers were escorted out of the building and Corporate replacements from Amazon HQ were walked in. It was an almost alien experience because they had walked into the building in a literal single file line to their new desks. With this, I digress. Amazon is not the subject of this collaboration. Although the scope of management changes at the Chewy Pharmacy was not as obvious as my experience with the Amazon take-over of the other company; deep-rooted leadership who had helped build the pharmacy program were weeded through and replaced with inexperienced people managers. With no training, information, or background sufficient enough to run a technical department of pharmacy, these leadership changes had and continue to cause concern for the veteran workforce in the department. Furthermore, due to the lack of background in the specifics of proper pharmacy functions, the new leadership has chosen to disregard QUALITY for QUANTITY. In some businesses, this is not absolutely a bad move. It can make company books look good, especially to investors. The problem is that in a business that is dealing with prescription medications, disregarding quality can greatly impact customer's family members (I.e. Family pets, Emotional Support Animals, Service Animals, and the true loves of our lives). While working there it was not unheard of to hear of or be involved in gut-wrenching situations that affected customers and their beloved pets. The reason for these oversights is due in part to 3 main factors.    
 

1. Mass hiring practices without regard to proven qualifications and/or individual capabilities.  
2. (*When I started with Chewy Pharmacy the only background I had was none! The only saving grace to that, once I was hired, was my care of maintaining a personal responsibility to compile and learn as much as I can to perform any job which I get paid to do for the benefit of customers and their pets. As we all should of course.)* 
3. Poor training. 
4. (*Again, when I started at chewy, the training was a joke. After my 1 week of training, I took it upon myself to compile all the information I would ever need into a reference binder which I had updated with every bit of communications provided by leadership. Tying this to the next bit in this section, these communications ended when Chewy went public and changed their leadership. Making it difficult to properly perform job functions and stay informed on changes.)* 
5. Leadership fear-mongering employees via harsh performance expectations.  
6. (*The push from management to appease company goals has created a fearful environment conducive to harboring careless mistakes.)*  

Shortly after going public the company stifled communications between hourly employees and salaried leadership. They abandoned their transparency by adjusting their leadership hierarchy to implement a buffer. One way they did this is by demoting all of their supervisors to shift leads and eliminating the supervisor position. In hindsight, this buffer has proven itself as a detriment to growth and leading to various instances of misinformation within the department. With leadership siting this change as an ""attempt to provide better training and support on the floor' we all know the real reason for this was to attempt to conceal themselves from the bombardment of concern to their implementation of poor practices.  

\~Section 2 \~ Lack of action to Coronavirus \~ 

Although my monetary and responsibility ties to the company have passed, I still have connections to lifelong friends and acquaintances within the pharmacy. Even though I was let go from the company a week or two before the explosion of Coronavirus across social media, I still harbor concerns for two of the main aspects involved in being a (former) part of this workplace. The people &amp; the pets. Plain and simple.  

 It has recently come to my attention that Chewy leadership is at it again. Disregarding the health of their employees and causing a major trickle-down that will affect the experiences of employees, customers, and pets alike. I happened to be able to grab a post from a former co-worker to provide a first-hand account of the realities of the situation behind their closed doors. 

Pictures of various instances and complaints are as follows:  

* **This post was removed and can no longer be found at its original** **posting.***“As* *a former* *Chewtopian, enough is enough. I’m spreading this so they can be heard! This company is exactly how explained in this post. They are not communicating with their employees, and that is what* *has fear* *struck all of them into whether or not an income is better than staying on top of their health during this COVID 19. Please* *please* *PLEASE* *share this before they have a chance to get it removed. Edit: This is strictly about Chewy Pharmacy’s call center. Not the warehouse. But please still share your story. This is not okay.”*

Unfortunately, this is just a small account of the transgressions of the leadership in Chewy Pharmacy. Keeping these examples in mind, it is easy to see the lack of care for human and pet life alike. The actions of these managers are irreprehensible.  

For the sake of all things. The future. The preservation of American integrity. The preservation of community. The preservation of love for all.  

I IMPLORE SOMEONE WHO IS MORE CAPABLE AND EQUIPPED THAN MYSELF TO TAKE ACTION. NOT ONLY FOR THE SMALL COMMUNITY THAT IS CHEWY PHARMACY, BUT ALSO FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OTHER PHARMACIES, CALL CENTERS, AND ANY OTHER WORKPLACE. WE TOGETHER **CANNOT** **STAND FOR THESE TRANSGRESSIONS AND BEHAVIORS!** 

**Thank you all for your time and attention. Don’t forget to love each other (from afar for the time being).**

I am an hourly supervisor working at a very obvious coffee chain that is still open during this pandemic. Our doors remain open here in Canada for anyone wanting to come in for a quick cuppa to go and that’s a problem with how bad the rate of confirmed cases isn’t flattening out at all.

Hope you're all at home or well away from other people. Hope it's not driving you *too* crazy yet. Today we're relaxing our normal rules a little to give everyone a chance to blow off some steam.

Since that should be all of you, have at it. Make sure to include proof (make a sign, have your dog hold it!), and have fun.

flt2f8,monkeymanwasd123,"I am a 19 year old conservative permaculture hippy into the carnivore diet, minimalism, extreme frugality, and a number of other things ask me anything. (life story basically)","I'ma just list off my life story real quick so yall will see what made me.

 age 1-2 could speak fairly well, age 3-4 autism wiped out my understanding of language and made me fairly insane, i was badly bullied by the local hawaiian kids for being a howly so we moved to oregon. somewhere around this time i became agnostic and learned about evolution. being agnostic came first i think.

Age 5 im addicted to computers, my father cheated on my mom with a 13 year old we let stay with us (i'm not sure if adopted is the right word for our situation), he was mentally abusive to her (he went to prison for 7 years but was let out in 6), i mentally woke up around this point to some degree as that's when my memory started getting more active because i became depressed (my sister and mom didn't tell me my dad wasnt what you would call a good person) , i noticed myself getting bullied in elementary school, got into medieval history, scifi, and fantasy and could read at a highschool level, developed anger issues, i was abusive to my sister(lended around high school), i was smart enough to realise that becoming a school shooter was a bad idea but it became a hobby to fantasize about it by third grade, learned how to cycle at some point. understood the basic value of exercise (10 push ups maybe 30 curls and lots of running).

changed schools, got into survival books around this time partly because i wanted to run away became home was super boring when i didn't have books or internet access. got glasses. got a ex cop step dad around this time.

(this section gets more space because its one of the few notable memories which later made me a better human (still an ambivert rather than an introvert nowadays)) moved and started middle school near a paper mill in portland, got a younger ""gf"", ghosted her soon after out of fear of dating a girl 4 years my junior, dated a blonde who was taller than me, she barely talked to me and i didnt know how to talk to her, we got together because i was really indecisive and kept saying maybe maybe not to stall for time because i couldn't tell her i couldn't return her feeling yet, i told folks we accidentally got together without explaining that i wanted to give the relationship a chance because no one asked, i experienced a short period of popularity and barely wanted to be violent, i told a guy next to me and he went to tell her, she gave me a look, i tried to talk to her later but she ignored me and eventually i gave up and just kept sending guilty looks her way when we passed in the hall or i avoided looking at her.

still the same middle school: read enough books that i considered working out to carry more books(i could always read VERY quickly). started running outside for exercise a bit but the smoke from the factory became an excuse. 

moved, did an extra year of middle school due to the school having an extra year for everyone. dated a girl for a while, i broke up with her because i knew i wouldn't be able to fall in love with her without forcing myself.

highschool:

  freshman year started reading a lot more digital books and such (used to hate it), started intensively surfing the internet, got into stoicism meditation zen and such.

sophomore year learned about extreme minimalism, barefoot running ,fasting, ""early retirement extreme"", allan savory, the wim hof method, carnivore diet and such. Had something akin to the western form of zen enlightenment while i was walking back from the water fountain.  basically my autism symptoms reduced a ton, my anger issues reduced a ton, more empathy, more outgoing, felt what beauty was for what may have been the first time outside of it being a concept, ect. started cycling a few miles to and from school most days, cycled during winter with socks and flip flops, flip flops and shorts were basically my uniform with a couple of jackets that are maybe 5-15 pounds in total.

my junior year was basically me becoming a hippy and confirming that the above was legit (i'm not into urine drinking, conspiracy theories voodoo or anything that cant be explained by science (unless you count hoping that infinite realities are a thing))

senior year i became ""social"" and asked out most of the girls in my class off a dare and the girls i had crushes on. became semi popular/known with the help of once per year fights from middle school + my last one in high school where i nearly beat the sense out of a kid nicknamed cheeto via meditating the whole day to do it. he asked me if i wanted to fight near the middle of the year and i thought about it and just casually said ""sure"". built a reputation as a self proclaimed hippy and argued with my plant sci teacher bout a few things mostly biomass (i had an A+ with her and an A or B with my vet sci teacher (went to vet sci because the other ag class would teach me about conventional agriculture which i can learn about on my own)) 

censored for those that might mind &gt;!got laid mother fuckers!!!!!!!!!! XD!&lt;

graduated with a mix of a's b's c's and maybe a d or two somewhere.

worked at the local farms for 2 summers during high school and for a short time after graduation until I worked for the northwest youth corps for a month(10/10 in work ethic is too high their standards are too low i was being lazy! ). now im unemployed until i work for my step grandpa next month taking care of the fields getting some livestock for my parents, clearing the lower branches of the timber to improve visibility and such, maybe plant some trees and change the seed mix for the fields... so many blackberries and poison oak i ignore even though i react haha.

fls98s,rakk124,I am a crew member on a cruise ship stuck at sea. Ask me or the crew something.,"  

Well, here we are; the end of the world as we know it.

For those of you just waking up from a coma, thanks to the Coronavirus, most of the world’s borders are slowly closing down, greatly restricting who and what can pass through them. Out of the literally thousands of cruise ships out there, there have been like three with confirmed cases (give or take) but despite that, thanks to the border closures, we’ll be spending the next thirty days minimum at sea.

As far I as know, our ship was one of the last to allow crew to disembark. We also sent several crew members home today, amidst all of the panic and confusion. Our ship has/had crew from over seventy different nationalities on board. We came from every corner of the world, but despite all the cultural differences, language barriers and food preferences, it really did (and still does) feel like a really big family, especially now.

For a lot of the crew, their sign-offs came unexpectedly and with a lot of confusion. Even this morning, people were frantically refreshing their emails to check and see if they still had finally received tickets, or if the flights that they did have weren’t cancelled. Hundreds of people left unsure of whether or not they could get home, many of them not wanting to leave, knowing full well that they’d be flying to countries that were on lockdown. We hugged and gripped their hands tightly, holding back tears as theirs fell freely, wishing them safe travels, and seeing the more religious crew praying for their health and security.

On deck two of the ship, there is a hallway that runs from the front to the back of the ship. Even during the Christmas holidays, I’ve never seen this hallway so busy. Even with the all-consuming job of disembarking the guests above, the walls of the second floor hallway were lined with crew, all eagerly awaiting their chance to say goodbye to our friends as they made their way towards the gangway and on towards uncertainty.

Now, except for essential crew and a few select departments, the ship is empty. With no guests to serve, or entertain, or clean up after, we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation. We’re still working though. Nobody onboard is on vacation and we’re not living it up, so to speak. The cooks still cook, the engineers still run the ship, and most of us, in addition to our normal responsibilities, are tasked with assisting in keeping the ship sanitized and any illness from spreading.

In the interest of having a way to pass the time, and hopefully to help reassure anybody who knows someone stuck at sea that we’re alright, my goal is to interview one crew member per day. 

I’ll have my first crew interview tomorrow, but I thought it’d be fair to answer a few questions that you may have already.

\-We’re all healthy and spirits are high. With the exception of a few roles, the reduced crew means a reduced workload, but we are still working.

\-We’re sanitizing the entire ship and the equipment from top to bottom every day. Even before COVID-19, the housekeeping staff always cleaned the ship multiple times per day. Despite their reputation as a floating petri dish (at least by my dad), cruise ships are very clean.

\-We’re still getting paid. We don’t know how long we’ll be onboard, whether normal operations will resume, or we’ll get disembarked somewhere once we find an open port, but as long as we’re here, we get paid.

\-We’re practicing self-isolation and social distancing as much as possible. Obviously when we’re working, there are times when this may be difficult, but we are following the same procedures as you.

\-There’s enough toilet paper for everyone.

\-Up to this point, there have been zero confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our ship.

\-Since most ports around the world are closed, we don't have a destination. Right now, we’re floating 12 miles offshore from the nearest coast.

\-Crew meals are at specific times based on department. Someone is monitoring to make sure everyone washes their hands AND uses hand sanitizer before they can enter the crew mess. Kitchen crew provide plates and cutlery (while gloved) and they dish out food to everyone so that only gloved hands touch the serving utensils.

\-We knew this was probably coming, we just thought we'd have at least one more port before it did. Those of us who could, stocked up on non-essential supplies. (The ship took on a stockpile of essentials today.)

If you have any other questions for me, or that you’d like me to ask the crew, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I’ll be posting the first interview tomorrow.

flreu2,Brookielad,I am anonymous and I study performing arts and was manipulated into thinking I had mental health issues. AMA,"Around 2 years ago I met someone at a performing arts school I attended on the weekend. He was the only person who was really only remotely nice to me, so we bonded throughout the class and would talk a lot over Xbox. Every weekend after the class we’d go into the town and just walk about and talk. After a long time of being friends with him he started to tell me that I was upset about things and he’ll help me. At the time I didn’t even think about it and just believed what he said. Eventually this spiralled into him making me think I had mental health issues, this made me do some pretty rash stuff which when I look back on now makes me feel bad. After manipulating me into thinking this he’d made me pretty vulnerable around him and could basically make me do anything he wanted me to do, examples would be, staying in town for longer than I should’ve, watching him bully someone and not say a thing and generally just make me do bad things. Once he had clearly been done with me he ignored me for a month or two, I tried contacting him but was ignored. After a while he got back to me and was clearly missing the things he could make me do, however by the time this was I had already made some healthier friendships and was living a better life with all the problems he made me thing I had out of the way.

flqaqc,mtbrittmohr,"I am Bam, a cake decorator/deli associate at a local Food Lion and just got suspended from work because I refused to take off my face mask while helping customers, in the middle of a pandemic.","I work in the deli department at a retail chain grocery store. In this time, I'm fighting panic attacks making myself go into work, scared of all the people I'll need to face in the process of taking orders and giving them their food. In order to do this, I am less than 3 feet away from customers the entire time I take and fulfill orders. So I've been wearing a face mask to lessen my chances of coming into contact with any bodily fluids.    
This evening, my store manager came up to me, armed with a binder of paperwork, and explains that I need to remove my face mask because the CDC announced that a face mask does not protect against the virus. I replied by telling him that while a face mask may not protect against air particles, it does protect against any bodily fluids that you may come into contact with while in close quarters to a person. I told him that I was concerned for my safety and I would not be removing the mask.    
So he told me that this means I won't be coming back until all of this is over. And I will not be able to come back to work until I remove the mask.    
Retail workers are not only risking their safety for the sake of keeping the locals supplied, they are now being forced to risk their health even more for the sake of keeping up a corporate image.

Ask Me Anything!,"Despite messaging from the Department of the Interior, parks nationwide remain open, in defiance of CDC recommendations, and employees are forced to work in unsafe conditions. Thousands of visitors are still pouring into national parks everyday, very likely propagating the virus.

When the government shutdown occurred, parks shuttered overnight due to politicians arguing about money. Now that we face a global pandemic, those same politicians are dragging their feet and arguing the financial impacts of sending the workforce home with pay.

The orders to remain open are coming directly from Secretary of the Interior, Trump appointee, David Bernhardt. The messaging changes daily, but the agency's actions do not. I have spoken to a few national news outlets today, but the only one to publish so far is my local public radio station. Help me make this a national conversation Reddit!

fljent,spiderloise,IAmAn 18 year old female who has been in both public psychiatric wards and a private psychiatric hospital. There is a huge difference between the two and I can answer just about everything you’ve wanted to know about daily life in institutions.,"Hey! So a little about myself first. I’m an 18 year old female who has been in and out of psychiatric wards from the age of 13-14 onwards. I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder as well as adhd, oppositional defiance disorder, depression, anxiety and psychotic symptoms that accompany the borderline.

Please note I’ve only been in public adolescent wards. I have done, and continue to do, absolutely everything in my power to never be admitted to an adult ward. The adolescent one was bad enough, and the stories I’ve heard about adult ones especially in my state of New South Wales, Australia have been horrific. The Miriam Merten case, an incident where a woman died because of negligence and abuse from staff was enough to put me off adult public wards for the rest of my life. They locked her in a seclusion room with only a mattress for 5 hours where she was completely naked and so heavily chemically restrained she fell over 20 times and hit her head so hard resulting in brain injury and death after being released from seclusion. I’ll post a link to the footage in the comments if requested, to think this happened as recently as 2014 is appalling as well as terrifying. 

I may be unsure about some questions relating to adult public wards due to this, although I do know a lot about them, but I can answer pretty much anything about adolescent wards. I can also answer everything about private psychiatric hospitals. Do keep in mind that different private hospitals have different procedures, so the answers relating to private hospitals will be from my own unique experiences. 

AMA about the contrast between private mental health institutions and public mental health institutions, as well as life inside them and my personal experiences in them!

Ask me anything.","Hi Reddit,I am Dr. Ritu Chopra. I am a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills and for the last few years I have focused the majority of my efforts on removing breast implants from women. I remove from 4-8 implants a week and have seen improvements in my patients lives who previously had symptoms of breast implant illness in different forms.

Last year the FDA banned textured implants and they were removed from the market. This started a discussion that is still going on to this day. During these very different times with COVID-19 and while people are home, I wanted to see if I can answer any questions there about breast implants, removing them and anything related.

Hey folks 

I’m massively into the free party scene in the UK but   all kinds of passionate , energetic music make my world go round.

I was recently forced to prematurely leave my parents home at a fairly young age due to mental health issues brought on by abusing Voidrealm acid which led to me having to hustle for a living in Bristol and perusing my deep desire to do live out an anarchist-esque ideology through living minimally and throwing free parties for free people. I spent a long period of time homeless and couch, squat and bunker surfing where i found a small community of like minded people who have helped make my vision possible. It’s all pretty new so only have a few months experience with it being the absolute centre of my livelihood already have some pretty mad experiences under my belt and have been throwing raves with my system i’ve dubbed Kwadrafonik Audio a couple years prior aswell. 

I rarely get to discuss this with open minded people so would appreciated some questions :) 

TL;DR: I throw nice illegal raves, ask me anything

EDIT: Sorry, i’m brand new to this subreddit and a new redditor in general wasn’t aware i had to provide proof i hope these links to the systems pages and my personal sound cloud are enough ? If you require more please message me privately as is potentially incriminating if given out fully fully publically.

EDIT 2: Tried super hard to message the mods for help with my proof but didn’t get any response at all from any of ya last time so i’ve added a couple more links , if this still isn’t enough please PLEASE message me ! I really want to share this. Thank you.

EDIT 3: Right, been deleted AGAIN which is fair because i didn’t attach a photo of me holding my reddit name so that’s added. However one of the mods said i needed a business card as-well??? Can you see given my life story above[Proof 4](https://m.imgur.com/QJICtTA) how i can’t possibly provide that ?

flglub,Cath_Saxton-Thompson,"I’m Catherine Saxton-Thompson, MPH, MSW, LCSW /Online Therapist, here to answer your questions about how to cope with the stress of Coronavirus and self-quarantine AMA!","With the rapidly spreading Coronavirus increases in stress, anxiety, and depression are an understandable consequence.

Supplies are running short and people are anxious.

We don’t know exactly what to expect and it can feel frightening and overwhelming. There is no one person this hasn’t hit in some very personal way.

Parents are suddenly having to do double duty, working (assuming they are still able to work) and watching their children which includes helping them stay on track with their schoolwork.

Kids are unable to socialize and play they way they are accustomed to. They are missing the structure and socialization they receive in their schools. This is not great for them and only adds to the stress parents feel.

Very few are immune to the financial stressors of this situation.

Many seniors and those with compromised immune systems live in fear of exposure. This fear is shared by those who love them.

This, my friends, is a perfect storm.

So let's talk about it! 

Here's a few ideas I have on how you can bolster your physical and mental health in the face of this, but I also want to hear your questions about what you're struggling with and see if I can't help a little bit. 

There are things you can do to bolster your physical and mental health in the face of this.

Connection- use this time to make the phone calls you don’t usually have time to make. Catch up with old friends and family. Facetime and Skype are nice fun that they give that face to face connection.

Service- Reach out to your neighbors in a safe manner. Checking in with others to make sure they are doing okay feels good.

Cleaning and Organizing- Making your surroundings more beautiful whether it be yard work, touching up paint in the house or washing windows. Anything that can brighten your environment is helpful.

Physical activity- If the weather permits, walk, go running, or ride bikes. If you have indoor exercise equipment, use it. You can get yoga or other exercise videos on Youtube.

Gratitude exercises- Every night its great to list the things that you were grateful for during the day. I start from wake up and chronologically list the things I am grateful for. Could be a great cup of coffee. Seeing the sky. Seeing a bird flying overhead. Reading a funny post on FB. Whatever brought you joy that day. It makes such a difference.

Relaxing activities- This could include a hot bath or a nice relaxing shower, listening to music, meditation, snuggling with your kitty or pup, breathing exercises, or moments of mindfulness in which you pay attention to what you can see, hear, smell, taste or touch.

---
I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.

We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

1. A Green New Deal
2. College for All and Student Debt Elimination
3. Medicare for All
4. No corporate money in politics

I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

My opponent is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is a centrist who has taken almost 2 million  dollars from corporate PACs. She doesn't support the Green New Deal or making college free. Her family has held this seat for 85 years straight. It is the longest dynasty in American Political history. 

I’m excited to do my first ever reddit AMA!!!

* How could you be ingenious to keep yourself alive and healthy in the immediate aftermath?
* What would be most useful to scavenge for? 
* And in the longer term, how could you avoid another Dark Ages and take shortcuts through the web of science and technology to reboot civilisation again as quickly as possible..? 

But I'd also love to hear your thoughts! What single possession or object would you prize most dearly? What would you consider to be the most vital knowledge or understanding to try and preserve in case of a cataclysm? What steps do you think could be taken to reboot civilisation as quickly as possible?

Hey folks 

I’m massively into the free party scene in the UK but   all kinds of passionate , energetic music make my world go round.

I was recently forced to prematurely leave my parents home at a fairly young age due to mental health issues brought on by abusing Voidrealm acid which led to me having to hustle for a living in Bristol and perusing my deep desire to do live out an anarchist-esque ideology through living minimally and throwing free parties for free people. I spent a long period of time homeless and couch, squat and bunker surfing where i found a small community of like minded people who have helped make my vision possible. It’s all pretty new so only have a few months experience with it being the absolute centre of my livelihood already have some pretty mad experiences under my belt and have been throwing raves with my system i’ve dubbed Kwadrafonik Audio a couple years prior aswell. 

I rarely get to discuss this with open minded people so would appreciated some questions :) 

TL;DR: I throw nice illegal raves, ask me anything

EDIT: Sorry, i’m brand new to this subreddit and a new redditor in general wasn’t aware i had to provide proof i hope these links to the systems pages and my personal sound cloud are enough ? If you require more please message me privately as is potentially incriminating if given out fully fully publically.

EDIT 2: Tried super hard to message the mods for help with my proof but didn’t get any response at all from any of ya last time so i’ve added a couple more links , if this still isn’t enough please PLEASE message me ! I really want to share this. Thank you.

fl8s8v,redditswyung,Hopeless refugee situation,"Hello I am a refugee, and now I am in a refugee camp. (I want to warn that I do not speak English very well) I understand that no one likes to listen to other people's problems. All people have enough of their worries. I think that we are born and die alone. This is normal, but nevertheless I will now try to describe my feelings. I'm not mature yet. (I don’t know if this is important.) I had to leave Ukraine (Crimea) with my parents because of political problems. Together with my family, I felt a danger to our life, because of our political views, so we decided to leave. Well, now, when I write this, we have already received several answers (refusals) from an organization that deals with refugee issues in the country in which I am now. Since, in their opinion, Ukraine is recognized as a safe country. And everyone around us says that for us it is impossible (or very difficult) or there is practically no chance to stay. But I understand that if we return, then at best, my father will be imprisoned. And it’s not clear what will happen to my mom. You see, parents are the most important thing for me in this world. I am ready to give my life for them. My mother always taught me that I should be strong, and always supported me. There are billions of people on the planet, but only two people in this world love me this My Mom and my father, and now I understand that I can lose them, and this is an unbearable feeling. And it really scares me, I don’t know what will happen to us tomorrow, I don’t know what to do, all the time I have terrible thoughts in my head, I dream of suicides every night. I would now give everything for the opportunity to stay in this country and just live in peace. Many teenagers of my age now have problems for example (how to take a test at school next week or how to invite Jessica on a date). And I just want my parents and I to have a quiet life. And now I want to urge you that everyone who reads this will realize that you need to appreciate every minute of your life. You need to value every second spent with your loved ones, because life is much shorter and faster than you think. It is a pity that I felt it at such a young age. And I want to repeat, we are born and die alone, and, unfortunately, no one can change that.",1,1584618753,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fl8s8v/hopeless_refugee_situation/,IAmA,1

fl5d7v,railwaylive,I manage a small music venue in the UK. The governement have thrown our entire industry under the bus AMA!,"I manage a small music venue in the UK called The Railway Inn. This is our 40th year of supporting grassroors music, we also regularly host artists from the USA, Canada and beyond . This week we have been forced to start a crowdfunder to keep our doors open.

Our Prime Minister suddenly advised the general public to avoid us, while not shutting us by law. Negating the business interruption insurance payout we, and many other venues across the country might have received. This was deliberate. 

Music/arts and cultural funds are the first things to be cut in a crisis. They are also the first to be missed when everyone is alone. 

Connection to culture and music is imperative in an isolated situation. Which we are all about to find ourselves in. 

Currently we can make it a week or so before we fold. Accepting thoughts and prayers at this point. That is how dire it is.

Yesterday I came home to Australia after my trip to Thailand was cut short because of this stupid virus. I’m currently in day 2 of Quarantine and I already hate my family. I can’t see any of my friends and I’m really depressed and just want to cry. It really shows how lonely you get when you have no human (that isn’t your family) to talk to. 

I’m happy to answer any questions and get some communication of other humans. 

My evidence is a photo of my ticket from Singapore to Brisbane, (Singapore was my transit city from Thailand) and a link to a news article about how any international arrivals into Australia must go into quarantine.

We have a staff of four people in the lab who are all full time employees, as well as an office employee in New Orleans and four salespeople who rely on this as their primary source of income. We product tinctures and topicals, package CBD flower, and handle packaging and shipping from that facility.

My real estate brokerage is called Satsuma Realtors, and we have 15 or so agents. Additionally we do property management, and my partners and I invest in real estate in the area, including renovation projects, long term rentals. I don't participate in airbnb but have clients who do so outside of my involvement.

Lastly, I own a small marketing company. There are 2 full time workers and a third part timer. We work with a PGA Tour event, multiple restaurants, event management companies, retail stores, and with all the other companies I am a partner in. 

I'd be happy to discuss the governments lack of response for people in my situation, what I expect to happen to real estate or my other businesses, or anything about that's going on in New Orleans or Charlotte, both of which appear to be among the hardest hit cities thus far. 

New Orleans in particular is in a really bad spot. People just didn't stop partying, and the delay in shutting down bars and Bourbon street considerably certainly increased the number of people who will be affected.

&gt; Hello everyone, I'm Dr. [Benjamin Park](https://benjaminepark.com/), assistant professor of history at Sam Houston State University. I am also co-editor of [Mormon Studies Review](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/journals/msr.html), and am on the executive boards for [Mormon History Association](https://mormonhistoryassociation.org/) and [Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/). I'm here to talk about [Kingdom of Nauvoo: The Rise and Fall of a Religious Empire on the American Frontier](https://wwnorton.com/books/9781631494864) (W. W. Norton/Liveright). Here's the overview: 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;An extraordinary story of faith and violence in nineteenth-century America, based on previously confidential documents from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;Compared to the Puritans, Mormons have rarely gotten their due, treated as fringe cultists at best or marginalized as polygamists unworthy of serious examination at worst. In Kingdom of Nauvoo, the historian Benjamin E. Park excavates the brief life of a lost Mormon city, and in the process demonstrates that the Mormons are, in fact, essential to understanding American history writ large.  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;Drawing on newly available sources from the LDS Church—sources that had been kept unseen in Church archives for 150 years—Park recreates one of the most dramatic episodes of the 19th century frontier. Founded in Western Illinois in 1839 by the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith and his followers, Nauvoo initially served as a haven from mob attacks the Mormons had endured in neighboring Missouri, where, in one incident, seventeen men, women, and children were massacred, and where the governor declared that all Mormons should be exterminated. In the relative safety of Nauvoo, situated on a hill and protected on three sides by the Mississippi River, the industrious Mormons quickly built a religious empire; at its peak, the city surpassed Chicago in population, with more than 12,000 inhabitants. The Mormons founded their own army, with Smith as its general; established their own courts; and went so far as to write their own constitution, in which they declared that there could be no separation of church and state, and that the world was to be ruled by Mormon priests.  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;This experiment in religious utopia, however, began to unravel when gentiles in the countryside around Nauvoo heard rumors of a new Mormon marital practice. More than any previous work, Kingdom of Nauvoo pieces together the haphazard and surprising emergence of Mormon polygamy, and reveals that most Mormons were not participants themselves, though they too heard the rumors, which said that Joseph Smith and other married Church officials had been “sealed” to multiple women. Evidence of polygamy soon became undeniable, and non-Mormons reacted with horror, as did many Mormons—including Joseph Smith’s first wife, Emma Smith, a strong-willed woman who resisted the strictures of her deeply patriarchal community and attempted to save her Church, and family, even when it meant opposing her husband and prophet.  
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;A raucous, violent, character-driven story, Kingdom of Nauvoo raises many of the central questions of American history, and even serves as a parable for the American present. How far does religious freedom extend? Can religious and other minority groups survive in a democracy where the majority dictates the law of the land? The Mormons of Nauvoo, who initially believed in the promise of American democracy, would become its strongest critics. Throughout his absorbing chronicle, Park shows the many ways in which the Mormons were representative of their era, and in doing so elevates nineteenth century Mormon history into the American mainstream.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be here for the next few hours (until about 4pm EST) to talk all things Nauvoo and Mormonism, so please flood this thread with questions!",2,1584543965,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fkqy3h/xpost_from_askhistorians_dr_benjamin_park_author/,IAmA,1

fkpsft,robgreenfieldreddit,I only ate food that I grew or foraged for one year: Rob Greenfield AMA,"Hello Reddit!
Rob Greenfield here. I recently finished a yearlong project of growing and foraging 100% of my food.
Last month an [interview I did with BuzzFeed about my project was on the front page of r/videos] (https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ex8nkm/i_only_ate_food_that_i_grew_or_foraged_for_one/) and I saw that there were a lot of questions. I've decided to do an AMA to answer them!
So please ask me anything!

A bit more about the project:
For one year I grew and foraged 100% of my food.
Every. Single. Bite.
No grocery stores, no restaurants, not even a drink at a bar.
Nature was my garden, my pantry and my pharmacy.
I lived in the city of Orlando, Florida in a 100 square foot tiny house. With no land of my own I turned front yards into gardens and shared the bounty of food with the homeowners. Over the year I grew over 100 different foods in my gardens, foraged over 200 foods from nature and I grew and foraged my own medicine and vitamins too. The purpose wasn't just to grow my own food, but to do something attention grabbing to create a conversation about the reality of our food system and inspire and instigate people to take back control of our food from Big Ag and create food sovereignty in our communities.

fkpoz5,thepoliticalrev,"I'm Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal running for congress against a 30-year incumbent (at the epicenter of the NY corona outbreak). AMA. [x-post r/Political_Revolution]","###[Link to post on r/Political_Revolution]

—-

I am running for Congress at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in New York. And it is shining a bright light on the deeper moral crisis in our democracy. It should also rally us to come together and address the inequality we have neglected for far too long in our public life. The working families of NY-16 deserve a Democrat who’s going to represent us and our kids, and fight for jobs and education, not bombs and incarceration.

I am Jamaal Bowman, and I’m running for New York’s 16th congressional district seat, representing the Bronx and Westchester.

I’ve been an educator and an advocate for public schools for over 20 years. I founded a public middle school in the Bronx, the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action (CASA), and served as its principal.
During my 20 year career as a public school teacher, guidance counselor and principal, I have served the most amazing children and families of New York City. But I also saw families struggle every day with poverty, illness, and the loss of a loved one due to incarceration.
I saw that even though I could work hard to make our school a world-class learning environment, I couldn’t change our underfunded budgets, our overfilled class sizes, and the punitive laws that penalized and criminalized black and brown students.
After two decades in public education, I’m tired of watching our families struggle to live a good life because they can’t get jobs, health care, housing, and dignity and safety they need. I’m tired of seeing hedge funds try to buy out our public school system through privatization. I’ve had enough of a generation of politicians who underfunded our schools and cut our social safety net while building more jails, bailing out Wall Street, accepting corporate PAC donations, and spending trillions of dollars on never-ending wars.
My decision to run for Congress grows out of my experience as an educator and an advocate for my students. The parents and students I serve want and deserve more.
The incumbent I am primarying, Eliot Engel, has been in office for over 30 years. He’s out of touch with the needs of the district, with the young people, with people of color, and with progressives who want to see change. In that time, he’s voted for an unjust war in Iraq, deregulating Wall Street, school privatization, and mass incarceration. He’s part of the reason it seems like we always have money for bombs and bullets, but never enough for good schools and good jobs.
My community is at the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis

Now that the coronavirus pandemic has descended on our country and is touching every aspect of our lives, my candidacy feels more urgent than ever. Because we all know who is going to get hit the hardest by the coronavirus: the working class.
With New Rochelle here in Westchester County being the epicenter of the NY outbreak, I think the impact of this pandemic hit home for folks in my district a bit sooner than in other parts of the country. I understand the anxiety felt by the people in my district. I am scared to go see my mother, who is elderly, because I am worried that I could be a carrier. My wife is also worried about going to see her parents.
We’ve suspended door knocking and petitioning, and until further notice I’ll be campaigning from here in my living room. We’ve been holding campaign meetings via Zoom, chatting on WhatsApp, and we’re going to be trying new ways to engage people and reach voters, like this AMA!. We’re all digital organizers now!
Too many of our leaders have been reactive rather than proactive. It’s not about press conferences, it’s about action. And those actions need to prioritize people and public health over profits. We have to make decisions based on what will save lives, not what will preserve earnings.
This moment of crisis has put a spotlight on just how little of a safety net exists for millions of Americans, working paycheck to paycheck, who have been left with no margin for error. For those Americans who can’t afford to stay at home from work and miss a paycheck, this is not just a health crisis, but an economic crisis. Donald Trump is talking about bailing out hotels and airlines -- but what about families like mine?
Now more than ever, the working families of my district need a leader who will advocate ferociously for them, and who has lived the same struggles as the people they seek to represent. I am that leader.

fkcjtg,niallcf,I'm historian Niall Ferguson. My new PBS special Networld explores the history,"Hi everyone! I'm Niall Ferguson, historian, best-selling author, and the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. I am also a visiting professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing, and a columnist for the London Sunday Times. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nfergus) @niallf

I am the host of PBS' TV event ""Niall Ferguson's Networld,"" premiering nationwide tonight (March 17, check your local PBS listings) and streaming for the next month on [pbs.org/networld](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/networld/), [the PBS Video app](https://www.pbs.org/pbs-video-app/) and [PBS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PBS). In ""Networld,"" I take a journey back in time to trace the history of social networks and, with the help of some of the world's leading experts, to explain some of the puzzles and paradoxes of network science. Find out the role social networks played in the Protestant Reformation and the American Revolution. Discover what the tech titans of Silicon Valley have in common with the industrial robber barons of the Gilded Age. And find out why it isn't just viruses that can spread contagiously through a population.  

Check out a clip here: https://vimeo.com/395262280

View episodes of Niall Ferguson’s Networld http://pressroom.pbs.org/Programs/n/Niall-Ferguson-Networld 

In this three-hour series I take a deep dive into the history of social networks and examine how the powerful combination of age-old human behavior and disruptive new technologies has driven revolutions in both the past and the present. How did the printing press cause both the Protestant Reformation and a transatlantic witch-hunting mania? How did social networks help Paul Revere to spark the American Revolution? And why did the railroad and telegraph networks produce not a golden but a gilded age of inequality? In the early days of the Internet, we were promised a flat world of netizens, all speaking truth to power. It hasn't quite worked out that way. As the world is plunged into chaos by a pandemic spread, like all contagions, through social networks, there has never been a more urgent need for us to understand their history and how they work to spread everything from a deadly virus to fake news.

Ask us anything!","As coronavirus continues to spread throughout the U.S., we want to answer your questions. Ask us anything!
 
Eric Cioe-Peña MD MPH is the Director of Global Health and a practicing emergency physician at Northwell Health. He is a public health expert and has worked extensively across the world on public health efforts.
 
Jayme Fraser is an investigative journalist for USA TODAY, focusing primarily on the Midwest and health. This year, one of her major projects digs into the accessibility of air travel for people with disabilities, both visible and invisible. When she's not reporting, she's watching soccer, crocheting beanies, or playing cards with a relative who is quarantined because her cancer makes her vulnerable to coronavirus and other diseases. 
 
For her most recent story, she worked with a colleague to analyze data from the American Hospital Association, U.S. Census, CDC and World Health Organization, finding that US hospitals will run out of beds if coronavirus cases spike like seen in other countries:

Adrianna Rodriguez is a health reporter for USA TODAY. She’s been in close contact with infectious disease experts, doctors and universities across the country to understand how the new coronavirus spreads and infects. These are two recent stories Adrianna has written:

[What does the coronavirus do to your body? Everything to know about the infection process](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2020/03/13/what-coronavirus-does-body-covid-19-infection-process-symptoms/5009057002/)

fk72id,ImperialCollege,We are researchers exploring how digital tools can help address young people's mental health needs. AMA!,"Hi Reddit! We are Dr Lindsay Dewa and Dr Emma Lawrance from Imperial College London.

In recent years there has been a proliferation of digital apps, tools and interventions aiming to prevent, identify, monitor and treat mental health issues. From apps to treat insomnia and depression to wearable devices for tracking sleep and anxiety, to online methods of delivering traditional mental health care. Sometimes, digital is trying to take something we know works, like therapy, and convert it to a digital form so we can reach more people. Other times, it is providing a novel approach we couldn't do another way - such as helping people confront their fears in virtual reality spaces.

While itâs incredibly exciting and promising to see digital technology being harnessed in this way, there are many challenges that must be addressed before digital can really reach its potential to support young people's mental health. For example: 
How do we know they work? For whom?
Have users and other stakeholders been involved in the creation process? 
Have all the ethical and privacy issues been considered? 
Are the sensitivities around cultural adaptation and safeguarding of vulnerable groups considered and adhered to?
How do people find the appropriate tool or intervention for them?
How do we link and blend with existing services to have the ""best of both worlds""?

Our research at the Institute of Global Health Innovation explores these questions particularly from the perspective of young people and seldom heard groups. We believe that a stronger evidence base will demonstrate how digital technology can be used safely and effectively to move mental health care to the next level.

fjw7l2,NoonaBear,"We are the developers of the Apple Arcade exclusive, Butter Royale. AMA!","Hello all!

I am the Community Manager for Mighty Bear Games, the developer and publisher behind the Apple Arcade exclusive, r/ButterRoyale. Butter Royale is the food-themed battle royale that we developed in 6 months. It was released on Apple Arcade on 24 January 2020. 

A little bit of background on our studio: 

Mighty Bear Games is a small studio based in Singapore that's around twenty Bears strong. We have Bears from 8 countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, India, France, Spain, Norway, UK, and Turkey. We started as a collective of game industry veterans, with 50+ years experience honing our craft at top studios and on AAA titles. Studios we've worked with include King, Ubisoft, EA, Lucasarts, Disney, Gameloft, and Jagex.

We have been posting articles on our Medium in an effort to share our learnings but we decided to try an AMA to reach out to more people! We would love to help artists/aspiring game developers learn what they need to know more about the games industry from the perspective of a small studio who managed to push out an Apple Arcade exclusive in just six months! We will try our best to answer any question you might have about game development or the industry itself so please, feel free to ask away! :)

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

There is concern that if too many patients fall ill with pneumonia from the new coronavirus at once, the result could stress our health care system to the breaking point -- and beyond.

fjjs3p,adamjonasbrother,Moderna's CEO Says Its Coronavirus Vaccine Will Be Affordable," As the COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread, demand keeps growing for effective treatments and vaccines. **Moderna** ([NASDAQ: ](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/moderna-inc/mrna/)[MRNA](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/moderna-inc/mrna/)), one of the only companies with a vaccine in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes the disease), made news Wednesday when its CEO said that his company's vaccine would be affordably priced.

Stephane Bancel said in an interview with Business Insider that he plans to price the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, in line with other vaccines for respiratory infections. Although he didn't offer an exact figure, one can look to prices for other vaccines, such as a pneumonia treatment, Prevnar 13 which has an average cost of around $240, to get a rough idea of what Bancel might be thinking.",5,1584359782,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fjjs3p/modernas_ceo_says_its_coronavirus_vaccine_will_be/,IAmA,1
fjjrjc,adamjonasbrother,Moderna Inc tipped to win the race for Covid-19 cure,"**Moderna** (NASDAQ: MRNA) has been one of the hottest biotech stocks on the market for the past few weeks. The company, which specializes in experimental mRNA-based vaccines, has garnered mainstream attention for its potential COVID-19 vaccine. The initial batch of the vaccine has already been shipped to U.S. health authorities, with initial phase 1 trials expected to begin soon.   


As one of the few companies with a COVID-19 treatment entering clinical trials, there's a lot of excitement surrounding Moderna right now. Shares of the company have grown 10% year to date while the **S&amp;P 500** has sunk by 12% over the same period. However, exactly how much money is this COVID-19 vaccine worth to Moderna, and is it truly the cash cow that many investors are expecting it to be? 

 What makes this vaccine special?

Unlike other vaccine developers that use DNA-based treatments, Moderna is known as one of the only companies working in the largely experimental domain of mRNA-based vaccines. In theory, mRNA-based treatments work faster and show greater efficacy than their DNA-based counterparts. Whereas DNA is found only in the nucleus of the cell, mRNA can be found more or less everywhere, making it easier to access.

Moderna has a pretty large pipeline of early-stage mRNA vaccines, but its coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, made news for just how quickly it was completed after the virus's genetic sequence was discovered. In less than two months, Moderna managed to develop an initial vaccine from scratch, an impressive turnaround time by modern drug development standards.

The first batch of the company's COVID-19 vaccine has already been shipped to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in late February, with clinical trials experimenting with a two-dose schedule expected to begin in April. If everything begins on schedule, that would be just three months from the initial design of the vaccine to human testing.

## What's the potential market size?

Unlike other COVID-19 treatments in clinical testing, mRNA-1273 can be used as a preventative (also referred to as a prophylactic) treatment. This is a big deal because there are millions of people who are living in areas deemed to be high-risk for COVID-19 infections but aren't infected themselves so they want to pre-emptively protect themselves.

Moderna's CEO, Stephane Bancel, spoke in an interview with *Business Insider* where he said that the company's COVID-19 vaccine will be [priced comparatively](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/04/moderna-ceo-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-a.aspx?utm_source=msnrss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=6288d502-4cc0-487c-845f-6ae655516a76) with other respiratory infection vaccines. To put that into perspective, Prevnar 13, a preventative pneumonia vaccine, costs around $800 for four injections. Bancel went on to add that he doesn't even see Moderna pricing its COVID-19 vaccine at that level, possibly being charging less than that.

If we theoretically say Moderna prices its vaccine at $600, that's still a lot of money considering there are millions of people who would be interested in having a COVID-19 prophylactic. In the Chinese province of Hubei -- the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak -- there are approximately 61.9 million people, with around 11.1 million in the city of Wuhan. Even if we assume that only half of the province's population chooses to take a prophylactic, the total addressable market in Hubei alone would come to a whopping $37.1 billion.

## What are the risks?

There are a couple of things worth noting, however. For one, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is still on the cusp of beginning phase 1 clinical trial with humans. Despite the company's head start, many health groups, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have said it could still be another 18 months before a vaccine is publicly available.

Clinical trials could end up reporting unexpected side effects during this time, something that would severely hurt Moderna's chances of successfully developing and marketing its COVID-19 vaccine. mRNA-based treatments are still quite experimental, with even Moderna's most developed vaccines only in early clinical testing. There's always the chance that something could go wrong as mRNA-1273 moves on to late-stage trials.",3,1584359702,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fjjrjc/moderna_inc_tipped_to_win_the_race_for_covid19/,IAmA,1

On Friday March 13th I received a generic email from the social worker, written by the CEO, stating that visitors are restricted to only one person between the hours of 12pm￼-6pm. Since then,  it has gone from large gatherings being cancelled to now even small ones. Because my medical case is so complex, which some of you may know from my previous AMA, I receive many different outpatient therapies in addition to what I receive here, at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital nearly five day’s a week . I just received word from Massachusetts General that all outpatient appointments are canceled for the next two weeks. Not only do I feel as if Spaulding will follow suit, I feel as if we are going into a full blown quarantine!

fjby0a,8bitgametime,I tried getting myself Coronavirus and failed. AMA,"Since the apocalypse is near, I figured I'd try to catch this disease before it catches me. So what I did was I went out looking for others who might have possibly obtained the virus somehow. That wasn't as easy as you think it would be which is kind of ironic considering everyone is trying to take precautions to avoid getting this disease yet it's so hard to even get because of how rare it is still. Obviously the disease is slowly spreading but at this point in time it's about as easy as finding a stick of butter where you wouldn't want it to be. Anywho, first plan obviously failed. So then I tried contacting Tom Hanks to see if he could somehow give me the disease but you know, famous people.. Didn't respond. Now that I think about it it's probably because of how sick he currently is. Anywho, I also tried drinking a bunch of Corona only to find out that's just a myth. Anyone know if Virus Vodka would work while drinking Corona? Anywho, that's my story. Peace.

I'm not sure who to ask for help, but I'll take any advice I can get. I am a certified teacher in Arizona and due to the Corona Virus scare my school has decided to close for the week. But my school district has decided that we must use our own PTO days if we want to get paid for this time off. Most people I work with don't have the PTO as we don't get a lot of days to begin with.The state of Arizona has declared a state of emergency but has recommended that schools stay open. My school has also not offered to allow teachers to come in to still earn their pay, they also have not provided education to the students during this time off through e-learning. We are told our only option is to stay home and only get paid if we have the PTO.

[Hi reddit Proof](https://imgur.com/U8p5WBj)

Here’s a quick breakdown of the accident so I don’t get a bunch of “how did it happen?” questions.

I make props/costumes for a living and I work for myself at home. While I was using a pressure casting chamber the lid failed and it exploded while I was checking the pressure gauge on it. The lid broke into a bunch of pieces and hit me in the face. I was alone at the time, but I was able to find help outside before going into shock. The doctor believes the only reason I’m still alive is because of the severe migraines I’ve had since early childhood, which resulted in me having an abnormally high pain threshold. Under normal circumstances, he said I should have immediately vomited, gone into shock, passed out and bled to death.

**My injuries in no particular order:** My left eye ruptured, my nose, left orbital socket, left orbital floor, left upper jaw, and left maxilla were broken, my left nostril was almost cut off, I had a huge gash on my forehead that was deep enough to cut into my skull and I was diagnosed with post-concussive disorder.

That’s the short version! I’m still a prop/costume maker and I’ve tried to make the best out of my accident and now make [light-up](https://imgur.com/i5fvYMA) and other weird prosthetic eyes for myself. I also advocate for other people who are handicapped but are afraid to cosplay.

Anyways, feel free to ask me anything and I mean anything. Nothing is off-limits, I’ve literally had trolls on Twitch ask me if they could “f\*ck my eyehole” so at this point I don’t think anything will surprise me anymore.

And before you think about asking to f\*ck my eyehole just realize it's not even an inch deep. :P",3,1584219740,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fiph6y/i_blew_my_face_in_a_work_accident_in_2014_was/,IAmA,1

Well the team at Jetset can honestly say they’ve paid out over $3 Billion dollars to their clients.

How crazy is that?

And now they’re opening up their doors to the masses and revealing all in step-by-step training videos.

They call it the Jetset course and if you haven’t heard about it you better check it out ASAP.

Ofcourse ASPD is diffrent for everyone, so I can only awnser questions about how I experience it. Now I'll just awnser two questions here: no I dont feel feelings like you do. I feel tiny fractions of feelings. And no I will not feel bad for you since I dont know you.

Ofcourse you dont have to ask me about that. you can also ask me about well me so a little information,

&amp;#x200B;

That's FOR EVERYONE

CARE

Why are you doing Anything? anything you do you do because you care:

example you want money to sustain yourself or you wanna have good a good time or feel safe , why? because you care about yourself.

the difference between an animal and an intelligent being is they can consciously and knowingly care about things

while animals care for simpler reasons like their own survival and not much else or/and do it without the awareness to know that is what they are doing. every being doing everything and anything for/ summed Care(I m being literal not a metaphor).

&amp;#x200B;

GOOD/BAD AND RESULT

CARING POSITEVELY

GOOD

care untwisted and simple is the good and it never really collides with other people care and when you think it does just think how that situation is actually an extortion that you do not like being inflicted on and how it as instigated by someone who said i nothing(i do not care) yet still managed to do something miraculously

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

VOID   LORDS

BAD

now since everyone doing anything cause of care how bad things happen? very easily since they are not being caring positively when you say example i only care about money ,you do not care about plastic paper, you care about you so you wanna have safety or fun or this or that but you skip the part that that is not necessarily true and even if it is, its circomstantial, someone like you made it to be so to begin with, not absolute

and how things can be so twisted? well every single one of the people that made or done something bad they always

say internally if not also externally that they do not care about him/her/them etc..

now what is do not care? its nothing so every time someone says do not care you should replace the word with nothing,

so think the meaning of the those various thoughts and sentences and the validity of saying nothing

i wont give you examples for both valid and not valid someone else would be better at that but some times if asked about something

a valid response is nothing but when someone was doing something bad nothing is never a valid one, not only that it also does not make sense like the following example

you did this so you can make money even though so many people got hurt                                   response   i do not care about them they are dumb

so basically

i nothing.      and also what they add after nothing is irrelevant

=so basically 0 sense

RESULT=MADNESS

&amp;#x200B;

Madness hiding word number...something:

Hypocrisy

is actually Madness in disguise despite the given definition hypocrisy is not being used when someone lies about his character or image but rather its being used when someone is lying to themselves and by extension to others. everyone is using it unconsciously to justify and legitimize double think, double think is when you tell yourself one thing when it does not suit you then tell yourself another when it does, which is basically madness ,hypocrisy is the word made for to cover that fact up:

hypocrite is an empty word to hide the belief of 2 conflicting ideas that contradict each other, basically madness, also its more of wanting to keep both beliefs at the same time even though you know they do not add up

THE MODULE OF WILL/WANT/PROOF OF BEING and the free part

Will and Want both are proof of existence but both so originate from Care and are varying reactions to it simply put so the module is Care

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Free Will: the free part is a whitewash

all it matters is that you have care whether in the form of desires or dreams ,passively along those lines or

actively doing something, free will means doing whatever you want which is impossible either

by limitations or even more so by definition since even if you had no limitations anywhere defining things means

also limiting them in a box, even by saying I you limit yourself to define you so that means free will is an

impossibility and its been used to justify that for example that since prisoners have no free will thus are non

existent even though the only way that happens is by surrendering your will willingly whether its temporary or

more long term surrender of will through some kind of sale, and that is still only simply till you decide otherwise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About LOVE, Adoration and Hate

WHAT IS LOVE?

love is caring a lot , deeply , etc..

naturally everyone loves themselves but you can love others also

it can be love of self or someone else not by definition but by usage

love for yourself is self explanatory ,by usage its actually caring a lot for or by someone else even though people try to confuse things because they do not want to really answer or get an answer for that

&amp;#x200B;

adoration

when you say i love this dress basically that is not love that is like a lot,

example: i like this shoes then you go to :i like this shoes a lot then its not i love ,

=its i adore those shoes,

not love but it is out of love of yourself

&amp;#x200B;

hate

hate is dislike a lot, not the opposite of love but the opposite of adoration , so people can pretend they are positive forces to basically sell what they like or shun what they dislike

&amp;#x200B;

care a lot=love

like a lot=adore

dislike a lot=hate

not caring=nothing(emptiness)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

INFERIOR/SUPERRIOR EFFECT

Inferior

What is Jealousy?

you tell yourself someone is better than you and since you cant really accept it u hurting from all that denial, that they call jealous

&amp;#x200B;

What is Envy?

envy is when someone reacts aggressively to the butthurt from the denial mentioned above

aside from the above there are other reactions also as

&amp;#x200B;

admitting it: yes i am jealous but i admit it so i am not in denial

&amp;#x200B;

now switch jealousy with denial on the above sentence and you get:

&amp;#x200B;

yes i am in denial but i admit it so i am not in denial  = LOL

&amp;#x200B;

Superior

basically when you think others with your nonsense measuring of things naturally your brain will put a fire on your ass when your measuring do not suit you(when you care),whatever your: you are better than others also applies to you being inferior. someone might feel sorry for you and spare your feelings but our own brains clearly do not thus denial which they call jealousy or envy ( jealousy+ aggression ) so they can admit it and/or so they can attack you with it

also there is no we in BEST

RESULT

Impossible to be superior but not get the denial that was mentioned above unless you are completely delusional thus thinking of yourself the absolute one: best of all time and for all time blah blah blewx

so instead of winners 98% of the population of Earth is mental,2% thinks its cultural thing and also there is me being weird

\--------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Main point: Every possible situation and instance of someone‘s actions can be summed up and is care, the difference is you have to be caring positively and when i say that i do not mean mannerism or attitude but rather if you go to the root of all reasons, actions and desires there is care but also the bad part where someone said do not care which is :nothing and like im trying to explain on this paper :every single instance some wrong due to someone’s actions happened they used the word nothing(don’t care) in an invalid way in their thinking                                                                                                     MARIOS YOU KNOW WHO",1,1584175571,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fifgcr/infinity_everyones_god_of_both_real_and_imagined/,IAmA,1

fia49f,COMUNITYmade,I am the founder of a shoewear company that produces all of its shoes locally. AMA,"Before my husband and I started this company together, we both spent decades in the footwear industry and have experience at larger companies like Nike, ASICS, Vans and TOMS plus a few scrappy startups. These various paths have brought us to a shared vision and a belief that we can make a difference in the world, no matter if it is on a small or large scale. Our shared philosophy on life allowed us to flip the business model around and focus on the *community* rather than just profits, using our shoes as the vehicle to help connect and inspire others to take action. 

Our shoes are made in Los Angeles by highly skilled craftspeople who have perfected the art of shoemaking. By producing locally, we have the opportunity to help support commerce in our community, allowing our workers to build build a sense of ownership and pride.

We are committed to making the most sustainable and responsible decisions in developing and manufacturing our products and our goal is to utilize the local materials and construction methods available to us. We are also driven by our consciences; many of our materials may come from overseas – not because it’s less expensive, but because the best shoemaking materials are very hard to come by in the US.

We believe it is important to be transparent during this journey and want you to understand some of the challenges we are up against by manufacturing in Los Angeles. We believe in fair business practices and fair wages for everyone involved. Our pricing model is different. We've placed community before cost. Unlike most shoes, the majority of the cost to produce our shoes is in the labor to handcraft them and each pair is special.

We make premium shoes, handcrafted locally that give back locally, to fuel our mission.

***For every pair of shoes we sell, we donate up to 20% to any charity of the customer's choice.***

We also make custom shoes with a turnaround rate of about two weeks! Everything is locally made, and quick turn production means less waste in unnecessary inventory.

I am an internationally recognized privacy expert, advising federal and state legislators, law enforcement, and international lawmakers on privacy issues. I specialize in cyberspace abuses, information and sexual privacy, and the privacy and national security challenges of deepfakes. Deepfakes are hard to detect, highly realistic videos and audio clips that make people appear to say and do things they never did, which go viral. In June 2019, I testified at the House Intelligence Committee hearing on deepfakes and other forms of disinformation. In October 2019, I testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the responsibilities of online platforms.

Ask me anything about:

* What are deepfakes?
* Who have been victimized by deepfakes?
* How will deepfakes impact us on an individual and societal level – including politics, national security, journalism, social media and our sense/standard/perception of truth and trust?
* How will deepfakes impact the 2020 election cycle?
* What do you find to be the most concerning consequence of deepfakes?
* How can we discern deepfakes from authentic content?
* What does the future look like for combatting cyberbullying/harassment online? What policies/practices need to continue to evolve/change?
* How do public responses to online attacks need to change to build a more supportive and trusting environment?
* What is the most harmful form of cyber abuse? How can we protect ourselves against this?
* What can social media and internet platforms do to stop the spread of disinformation? What should they be obligated to do to address this issue?
* Are there primary targets for online sexual harassment?
* How can we combat cyber sexual exploitation?
* How can we combat cyber stalking?
* Why is internet privacy so important?
* What are best-practices for online safety?

fhvz7f,PliktheCat,When the Buddha was scolded.,"2 (2) Abuse (Note: Some say - Akkosa Sutta: Insult – translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in

the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. The brahmin

Akkosaka Bharadvaja, Bharadvaja the Abusive, heard ""It is

said that the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan has gone forth from

the household life into homelessness under the ascetic Gotama.""

**Angry** and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and

abused and reviled him with rude, harsh words.

When he had finished speaking, the Blessed One said to him:

""What do you think, brahmin? Do your friends and colleagues,

kinsmen and relatives, as well as guests come to visit you?""

""Sometimes they come to visit, Master Gotama.""

""Do you then offer them some food or a meal or a snack?""

""Sometimes I do, Master Gotama.""

""But if they do not accept it from you, then to whom does the

food belong?""

""If they do not accept it from me, then the food still belongs to

us.""

""So too, brahmin, we-who do not abuse anyone, who do not

scold anyone, who do not rail against anyone-refuse to accept

from you the abuse and scolding and tirade you let loose at us.

It still belongs to you, brahmin!

""Brahmin, one who abuses his own abuser, who scolds the

one who scolds him, who rails against the one who rails at

him-he is said to partake of the meal, to enter upon an

exchange. But we do not partake of your meal; we do not enter

upon an exchange. It still belongs to you, brahmin!""

""The king and his retinue understand the ascetic Gotama to be

an arahant, yet Master Gotama still gets angry.""

(Note: Some sources said:

… yet, Do Master Gotama still gets angry?)

\[The Blessed One:\]

""How can anger arise in one who is angerless,

In the tamed one of righteous living, 

In one liberated by perfect knowledge,

In the Stable One who abides in peace?

""One who repays an angry man with anger

Thereby makes things worse for himself.

Not repaying an angry man with anger,

One wins a battle hard to win.

""He practises for the welfare of both-

His own and the other's-

When, knowing that his foe is **angry,**

He mindfully maintains his peace.

(Note: Some sources said:

He/she who knows the other is angry and can still his mind and be conscious,

it can be said that he/she does for benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other.)

""When he achieves the cure of both-

His own and the other's-

The people who consider him a fool

Are unskilled in the Dhamma.""

(Note: Some sources said:

When he/she preserve the benefits of both parties that are him/herself and the other,

those who are not intelligent in Dhamma will think that he/she is a fool.)

When this was said, the brahmin Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to

the Blessed One: ""Magnificent, Master Gotama!. . . I go for refuge

to Master Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the Bhikkhu

Sangha. May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama,

may I receive the higher ordination!'

Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan received the going

forth under the Blessed One, he received the higher ordination.

And soon, not long after his higher ordination, dwelling alone

... ... the Venerable Bharadvaja became one of the

arahants.

From: Tipitaka, Suttapitaka (A new Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya, The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, Bhikkhu Bodhi: Brahmanasamyutta, Page 255: 2 (2) Abuse)

///////////////

The above is the second Sutta in Brahmanasamyutta. I (writer) will now talk about 1st – 5th Sutta which are also directly related to the matters of anger (5 out of 10 Suttas so to keep this article short and brief).

The first Sutta said about the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. He saw Dhananjani praised and had confidence in the Blessed One, he then tried to go and refuted with the Blessed One. Angry and displeased, he asked:

""Having slain what makes one sleep soundly?

Having slain what makes one not sorrow?

What is the one thing, O Gotama,

Whose killing you approve?""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""Having slain anger, one sleeps soundly;

Having slain anger, one does not sorrow;

The killing of anger, O brahmin,

With its poisoned root and honeyed tip:

This is the killing the noble ones praise,

For having slain that, one does not sorrow.""

The brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

(Then in 2nd Sutta above, Akkosa then angry (probably because the 1st is his friend? And Akkosa didn’t like it when a friend started believing in something else / someone else :D) and came meet the Buddha, angrily.)

The Third Sutta, Asurindaka, in Brahmanasamyutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja.

Asurindaka Bharadvaja also heard the same as Akkosaka. He then came with anger and displeased to abused (scolded) the Blessed One. When he finished, the Blessed One remained silent, he continued: ""You're beaten, ascetic! You're beaten, ascetic!""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""The fool thinks victory is won 

When, by speech, he bellows harshly;

But for one who understands,

Patient endurance is the true victory.”

(Some sources said:

Those who speak rude words thinks he/she has won.

But Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.)

(From here same as Akkosa)

""One who repays an angry man with anger

Thereby makes things worse for himself.

Not repaying an angry man with anger,

One wins a battle hard to win.

""He practises for the welfare of both-

His own and the other's-

When, knowing that his foe is **angry,**

He mindfully maintains his peace.

""When he achieves the cure of both-

His own and the other's-

The people who consider him a fool

Are unskilled in the Dhamma.""

Asurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

The 4th Sutta said about The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja. He also heard the same as Akkosaka. Angry and displeased, he approached the Blessed One and silently stood to one side.

Then the Blessed One knew his thought and said to him:

""If one wrongs an innocent man,

A pure person without blemish,

The evil falls back on the fool himself,

like fine dust thrown against the wind.""

(Some sources said:

He/she who harms one, who harms no one, who is pure, who has no desire.

The sin will definitely return to him/herself who is Rascal.

Just like those who throw fine dust against the wind.)

The Brahmin Asurindaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

The 5th Sutta said about The Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja. (This one wasn’t angry at the Buddha.)

He said to the Blessed One: ""I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama. I am Ahimsaka the Harmless, Master Gotama.""

\[The Blessed One:\]

""If one were as one's name implies

You would be a harmless one.

But it is one who does no harm at all

By body, speech, or mind,

Who really is a harmless one

As he does not harm others.""

(Some sources said:

""If his/her name is Ahimsaka,

He/she should not harm others.

He/she who truly does no harm via body, speech, or mind,

his/her name truly is Ahimsaka"")

Note: By now, we can understand that Ahimsaka means A harmless one.

The Brahmin Ahimsaka Bharadvaja then praised the Blessed One and ordained. And later, he became one of the arahants.

Recap/Summary:

1st Sutta: Eliminate anger / Don’t get angry, and one will be happy.

2nd Sutta: Don’t exchange angrily with those who angry at you.

3rd Sutta: Patient endurance is the true victory for the wise one.

4th Sutta: Sin / bad Results sill return to those who harm others. (Which the bad results will be explained more in other suttas)

5th Sutta: To truly be a harmless one, one must not harm others via body, speech, or mind.

A bit Extra: And to achieve this, one must also practice his/her mind by meditation.

End: When the Buddha was scolded.

fhc2it,ScarlettKate1928,I am a certified euthanasia technician (CET). Ask me anything.,"I (26F) worked for four years at a private admission animal shelter that offered public euthanasia services for terminally ill, elderly and dangerous animals. We also euthanized pets deemed dangerous by animal control and terminal/dangerous animals that had been surrendered to the shelter. The shelter did not euthanize for space or time, so I have limited experience with mass or convenience euthanasia

Being a CET gives me the legal authority to handle and administer euthanasia solution as long as I am operating under a licensed vet. At our facility, owners were not permitted to be present for the service and it was preformed in a separate room away from the shelter animal population. 

There are two main brands of euthanasia solution, Fatal Plus and Euthasol. Fatal Plus is blue and is more common in shelters. It kills at a rate of 1ml/10lbs. Euthasol is pink and is more common in private practice. It's too thick to pass through a needle quickly so it has to be diluted for proper administration. 

The three acceptable methods of euthanasia include IV: intravenous, injected into the vein, IP: intraperitoneal, injected into the abdominal cavity, and IC: intracardiac, injected directly into the heart muscle (only advisable for unconscious patients). 

Gunshot wound to the head is still federally considered humane euthanasia in the United States, and Utah still uses gas chambers to fill their excess animal population. 

I know this topic is pretty taboo and definitely has an extremely negative stigma, so feel free to use this opportunity to find answers to anything from ethics to physical occurences. The only thing I cannot answer in depth would be the details surrounding the biological process that the injection causes.",82,1583994771,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fhc2it/i_am_a_certified_euthanasia_technician_cet_ask_me/,IAmA,1

I‘m Adam, a [start-up](https://github.com/generalized-intelligence/GAAS) founder in China, and also a [podcaster](http://techreview.social)/[vlogger](https://space.bilibili.com/318090999). 2020 will not be easy for anyone staying in China, but after all, we have come and learned a lot of experiences and lessons about viruses (some were forced to learn).  

Since my brother is in Illinois, I have always been concerned about the situation in the United States. I was surprised to find that although there are many differences between the two countries, there are many common problems in the virus. So I hope our experience could help you.

Welcome to ask me any topics related to living in China (or myself) during the virus. If you are a reporter and would like me to help translate some Chinese articles, I would be happy to do so.

English is not my native language, so please forgive me for possible grammatical errors.

I am a life long Chicagoan, born and raised in the 5th District. I am an attorney working at the intersection of law and technology. I have experience working at federal agencies in DC. I've planned and participated in pro-climate and anti-Trump events.

Most importantly, I am a concerned citizen. We are in an ecological, economic, and political crisis and, like a lot of people I've talked to while campaigning, I'm concerned by what our future looks like if we don't act now.  

Our district is about 75% Democrat, and it is districts like this that should be leading from the left with truly progressive policies that benefit all Americans, not just the 1 percent. I support Medicare For All, a Green New Deal to fight climate change, and 15 dollar minimum wage.

I'm running for office because we need new ideas and new approaches to the major challenges of our times.

fglt0n,MarkRenton93,The story from the action movie.,"Hello, my name is Daniel. 

I have a story like Forrest Gump, but from the perspective of a Russian person. And this story is without a good ending. I was born in a poor city, lived up to 11 years in the ghetto (drugs around, murders, robberies). I went to school in my area and was bullied there. Then my parents got rich, and I transferred to the best school, where I became a bully. I first drank beer when i was 9, vodka at 13, tried marijuana at 16. When I was 17, I witnessed a terrorist attack in my city, there were victims. Then I wanted to join the army. Nevertheless, I studied well in high school and was able to go to university with a scholarship to an economist. I was the best student on the course, but had promiscuous sex. Once I really fell in love, we met, but she cheated on me. After that, I started smoking, drinking, and using drugs. In the end, I had problems with the law, I graduated from the university with the highest grades, but still had to join the army. I wanted it, but otherwise I would go to jail. Yes, one guy and I cut each other with knives in a fight. I went through officer courses (and since childhood I went in for sports), so I ended up in Russian special forces. I served there for five years, participated in counter-terrorist operations in the northern Caucasus , and for 9 months I was a sniper in Syria, was wounded and went home. I quit a year ago, got bipolar disorder and PTSD, almost shot myself, turned to a psychiatrist. Now I'm on prescription drugs.

During my illness, I crashed my car drunk, got an overdose of drugs, broke my finger in a fight so that it required surgical intervention. Now I continue treatment. Ask your questions.

Damn, my life is shit. 

 Here is my medal. The inscription on the medal: the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, a participant in the military operation in Syria. [https://imgur.com/ZG0ufMf](https://imgur.com/ZG0ufMf) [https://imgur.com/Hkafsvr](https://imgur.com/Hkafsvr)

AMA!","Hi Reddit, today is the 100th birthday of Partners In Health co-founder Tom White, so we thought we’d pop by to answer some of your questions about Partners In Health and the state of global health in general, including any questions about coronavirus. 

Tom used his fortune to help start Partners In Health, which grew out of a single clinic in rural Haiti. Over time, and following in his footsteps, hundreds of thousands of supporters have helped us keep patient care at the center of our work, while we fight for health care as a human right—both within individual countries and the halls where global health policy is created. 

Today, PIH runs programs in 11 countries (Haiti, Peru, Rwanda, Mexico, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Malawi, Lesotho, Russia, Kazakhstan, Navajo Nation), where we provide direct care to millions of patients, through public facilities and community engagement. We build health systems with the staff, stuff, space, systems, and social support to effectively fight infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and cholera, as well as provide maternal and child health care, mental health care, treat noncommunicable diseases and more. 

We're currently preparing our sites around the world for COVID-19, the novel coronavirus disease, which we know will disproportionately harm marginalized communities like the ones in which we work. 

Here’s our proof: https://twitter.com/PIH/status/1235294429990223874

fg5s0s,132Skiper,I am a Venezuelan refugee who escaped the humanitarian crisis. Ask me anything,"Hello Reddit,

I'm a Venezuelan student and in January 2017 I left my country looking for a better future, now I live in Panama and I'm going to graduate from Civil Engineering, I haven't seen most of my family since I left and I'm continually working and studying to be able to bring them all with me.

I will answer, with no censorship, any question regarding the current state of Venezuela, my experiences and my opinions about it. I can talk about how all the corruption, involving Cuba, destroyed what was Venezuela before the crisis, however, I will not  engage on a political debate between left and right, since that's a much deeper topic.

fg577e,blindwhispered,I am an 18 years old boy who used to heard fake voices in my head. Ask me anything," I use to hear voices that convinced I was watched all the time and some of my neighbors will try to kill me. Every place I was I felt like I was watched, I thought they just try to scare me because it passes several weeks and nothing happened, I stopped going to internet beliving that they hack me and they know many things about, I felt without privacy at all, I couldn´t even take a shower, because I believed somehow they will see every moment I do, and because of that for some unknown reason I started to believe that they post my recordings on the internet and everybody watches me and my daily life, I was wondering why they like watching such a boring life and because I stopped everything to stop being persecuted, and then the voices starting to make me believe things otherwise I couldn´t believe, like that my mother hates me so much and because she being narcissistic it what caused my dad to divorced, that my dad was a sociopath, and every day I could day and none will even. I thought I was like a certain of weird entertainment for the internet and they just wanted to know how I will die, and that nobody actually cares about me, I felt pretty lonely, I almost lived my housed twice, I refuse to go to school because of there I could get myself more easily killed by just being hit by a car, I even stopped masturbating for around 4 months, and then because of my real apathy for school, I had during those days, the really bad grades, and because my mother caught me talking alone, I went to the psychologist of the school to tell her the experience and then I went to the psychiatrist to take the medicine that I still taking to destroy those voices. I was a weird experience man, 6 months of my life where almost everything was lies I made myself. if you want to I could tell you more about it, maybe one day I will make a film about my experiences since I want to be a filmmaker.

ffzcg2,newsday,We’re the only journalists who interviewed Colombo underboss SonnyFranzese before he died at 103 last month. Ask us anything.,"We’re Newsday journalists Sandra Peddie and Bobby Cassidy. When we learned that Sonny was getting out of prison in June 2017 at the age of 100, we decided we had to do that story. He didn’t talk to us then, but we decided we had to try to land an interview. It took us months. And when we finally met him at his nursing home in Jackson Heights, he didn’t disappoint. We talked to him five more times, always over his favorite dish of pasta e fagioli.
 
He once was considered a rising star in the Mafia, and FBI memos on him were sent straight to the FBI’s legendary director, J. Edgar Hoover.

In the 1960s, he was photographed constantly on streets of New York, often with a beautiful woman on his arm. Unlike other mobsters of his era, who hid their faces from photographers, Sonny never did. And that may have been his undoing. At least, he thought so.
 
In 1966, four different law enforcement agencies indicted Sonny for an array of crimes. He beat three of them but was convicted of the fourth – masterminding a nationwide bank robbery spree. The judge sentenced him to 50 years in prison, with no minimum term. 
The sentence was designed to encourage him to cooperate. He never did. He served 35 years in prison. And while he was away, his family fell apart.

It has already made waves. [Congress announced](https://www.propublica.org/article/dating-apps-can-be-dangerous-congress-is-investigating) it will be looking into “extremely troubling reports” of sex offenders and minors using dating apps. 
 
[Recently, we published a how-to guide for reporting sexual assaults that result from online dating to the apps themselves.](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-report-a-sexual-assault-to-a-dating-app)

My name is Dexter Obrado, 19 years old, currently in college for accountancy but aspiring more to become a creative writer. Although I do have exams today, I decided to post my experience from the past of having epilepsy, since I don't really mind about the exams.  


I don't know if this is enough but I hope this is enough proof:

I have been cleared from it 7 years ago, but recently got ""attacked"" on July 2019 (due to my negligence in taking care of myself). Surprisingly, I'm still negative from it.  


I'm currently at our exams week, but I decided to post this anyways so I could share this. I might not answer instantly, but rest assured, I will answer it.

we are producer/filmmaker Sebastiano Pupino ( [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4195384/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4195384/) ) and VFX artist Emanuele Serra ( [http://www.emanueleserra.com/](http://www.emanueleserra.com/) ). We worked in Italy for a while and then we met in London during the production of Gadget, a dystopian short film which was premiered at the 42nd Boston Sci-fi film festival. Just about one year ago we've decided to produce an art-house feature film called The Last Bite - it revolves around Carlos, an artist stranded in London who struggles with normal human relationships. We've released the film on Amazon Prime and submitted it to several festivals around the globe.

In support of International Women’s Day, we are starting a campaign ‘Sex Is Part of the Equation’ to encourage an open dialogue around the politics of pleasure.

ff408c,ScarlettKate1928,I am a certified euthanasia technician (CET). Ask me anything.,"I (26F) worked for four years at a private admission shelter that offered public euthanasia services for terminally ill, elderly or dangerous animals. We also euthanized pets deemed dangerous by animal control or terminal/dangerous animals that had been surrendered to the shelter. The shelter did not euthanize for space or time, so I have limited experience with mass or convenience euthanasia. Being a CET gives me legal right to handle and administer euthanasia solution as long as I am operating under a licensed vet. At our facility owners were not allowed to be present for the service and it was preformed in a separate room away from the animal population. 

Because of the sensitivity of the subject, I don't want to provide my personal information as proof, but I can mention a few pieces of information that should suffice. 

There are two main brands of euthanasia solution, Fatal Plus and Euthasol. Fatal Plus is blue and is more common in shelters and kills at a rate of 1ml/10lbs. Euthasol is pink and is more common in private practice. It's too thick to pass through a needle quickly so has to be diluted with water for appropriate administration. 

The three acceptable methods of euthanasia include IV, intravenous: injected into the vein, IP, intraperitoneal: injected into the abdominal cavity, and IC, intracardiac: injected into the heart muscle. 

Gunshot to the head is still considered humane euthanasia in the United States and Utah still uses gas chambers as a means of euthanasia which has yet to be outlawed in their state.",1,1583625513,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ff408c/i_am_a_certified_euthanasia_technician_cet_ask_me/,IAmA,1

ff2axs,Moorevfr,15 yr old table?’,"Hi all, first post to this.

So my mum had decided to do some house decorating and one of the rooms is her dinning room.
Apart of the this decoration is to buy a new dinning room table.

So she decided to ask my wife and I if we want it...
To be fair as it’s in her dinning room it’s hardly used but it’s 15 years old with a few marks and scratch but good condition.

I say no as it’s a have a good glass of extendable table that’s does it job but the wife has interest in it. I’m like nope don’t need it not an upgrade in my eyes and worth the time and effort to get it my house as our cars won’t fit it but my mum seeing it as an easy get rid of to make room for her new one.

An auntie visits with a large enough car to my mums and ends up getting involved to take it to my hour.

So Friday mid evening I’m informed it heading my way with me being not so impressed thinking what am
I gonna do with my glass one?!

Home from work and I’ve taken the legs off my perfect goodly table and put them and the top on my drive way ready for the my mums old one to be delivered! Taking the orders from my wife and mother!

Dad and uncle turn up with my auntie in her car to drop it off and put legs back on me being there to help them and not showing any excitement as still thinking now I’ve got my good glass one stuck on my drive way! When it was fine as it was doing a fine job as table!

Roll on Saturday night (now) dad picks us up from a family games night on the wife’s side here sisters house. 
I’m tipsy and can’t help let out my annoyance to my dad that I’m stuck with a large glass table on my drive way that I now have to find way to get rid off and he get annoyed because he now thinks I’m being ungrateful for the table that they gave me even though I’ve done them a favour having it and getting the space ready for their new one even though is didn’t need or want one but instead got pushed in by wife and mum just because they decided it look nicer.
Sorry I am not going to act greatful for doing you favour getting your old stuff out for you new to then be burdened with then getting rid of mine which if none of that wasn’t the case I’d still be happy with!

Am I the asshole for this?!

At the moment I feel no and pissed off as my wife said I was rude for telling my dad the burden and him going all moody but he ain’t got nothing to shift or arrange someone to come and move a thing! 

Table is table in my eyes our glass was was appreciated until a wooden was passed/pushed to use !

I’m stubborn person so don’t if if I’m right or wrong in this situation?

Whatever the outcome I’ve not got a glass dinning room table sat on my drive way that I’ve not got to get rid of as wont fit in my car so however it goes to will take my spare time and my effort!",1,1583618320,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ff2axs/15_yr_old_table/,IAmA,1

But our teacher was a druggie and was always pissed at us. The other teachers were that way too, just not as bad. As the year went on my class started defining her more and more. To give you a prespective on how bad it was, I have ADHD so I was fidgety and everytime I fidgeted she would yell at me. Or if I raised my hand, she would throw stuff at me(staplers, textbooks, ect.) Half way through the year the numbers of our class had dropped from 25 to 10. Things started to get violent, other kids formed gangs and would essentially torture use until we gave in. My parents didn't care and sent me to school everyday. I got so sick of it I started cutting to give me another pain to replace the others. One night I had the knife to my throat ready to die and the only things that stopped me was the bluntness of the knife and the thought that, even I wanted to die I could live for my friends. Me and my friends stuck together and held through till the end. After that iin middle school, all my friends exept one had killed themselves. I got raped several times in the boys bathroom and was still cutting. Then in 9th grade I came out as bisexual and my parents abandoned me. I kept going to school but lived on the streets for about a month. I was determined to get a degree. J was taken under the wing of this old gay couple, who fed and clothed me. Then in 10th grade one of them, Gregory was shot by the police and died. The other one, Hermit got sick and couldn't pay for the apartment any more. So I lived in a shelter for a while until my boyfriend's parents let me live with them. By 11th grade I had several colleges that wanted me to come with them. After that my boyfriends parents got divorced and it drove by boyfriend to suicide. By this time I had a job secured and saved up enough to go to college. Now here I am, a depressed 19 year old living in a dorm with seven other people. Now I am the leader of a Antifa Organization.

[My name is Mike Broihier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjpmrHblopg), and I am running for US Senate in Kentucky to retire Mitch McConnell and restore our republic.

As a Marine Corps officer, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace, ashore and afloat, for over 20 years. I retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought a 75-acre farm in the rolling hills of south-central Kentucky. 

Since then, I've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I also worked during that time as an educator and as a reporter and editor for the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

fexzgd,Big_Black_Cat,IAmA self-taught web dev who just released a ‘hybrid’ mobile game that I've been working on for the past year. AMA about hybrid apps.,"'Hybrid' apps are made using web languages like Javascript/HTML/CSS and then turned into a mobile app using something like Cordova.

I work as a web developer, but really enjoy making games as a hobby. This is the third game I've released to the App Store and Google Play. Usually, you can't do anything too crazy with hybrid apps, but simple games can be fun too :)

This game is called ""Circle Status"" and I developed it with my husband (also a software dev). The game takes place in a 2-dimensional world, inspired by Edwin Abbott's Flatland universe, where social status is determined by the number of your angles. You start off as a 'lowly' triangle and the goal is to make it all the way to a circle. I wrote up a [blog](http://www.anaphylacticapps.com/blogs/circlestatus/) on our process if anyone's interested.

The game can be downloaded here:

While it was fast-paced and exciting, what I truly valued was the ability to mentor new Sailors and help them adjust to life at sea.

When the opportunity arose to transition from my flight operations role and move to Naval Station Rota in Spain, I had a ton of doubt. But once I transitioned, I found a new purpose ensuring my fellow Sailors had someone to talk to and a solution to their problems. My three years in Rota included Flamenco dancing, paella and the Semana Santa festival. That period of my life taught me so much about the world, and myself.

The most important lesson I’ve learned in the Navy is that everyone has a part to play. Because when a diverse group of individuals come together to do a job, they can do it better because of their differences. Ask me anything.

I moved to Texas to pursue my love of guns, something that's largely banned in my home country. Now I can hunt and shoot on my own property. You can watch my episode on AJ 's “Untold America” here. I immigrated to the United States six years ago, first to California. I found it difficult to hunt and shoot there in terms of legislation, affordability, and crowdedness so I decided to move to Texas where the gun laws are more lax. I could also have a whole ranch in Texas for the equivalent of a house in California.I turned my ranch into a business, catering to Chinese visitors and residents who are interested in learning how to hunt and shoot in Mandarin. Besides hunting, guests can also fish, camp, and picnic on my ranch.Guns are pretty much inaccessible to average civilians in China, my home country. I grew up seeing them in magazines and playing first person shooting games, but was never able to have any of my own...until I moved to the United States. Now, I get to live out my version of the American dream. I'll be taking questions from my ranch near Dallas. Dolly Li, the AJ  host and producer who came to film with me in Texas, will be responding and translating on my behalf.

All of the sudden, we had tons of chargebacks—and had no idea where they came from, or what they meant. And the banks froze our accounts!

 
So I went on the offense. I began meeting with risk managers and studying the credit card company regulations. Then I came up with an idea.  By calling customers that has filed chargebacks and finding out why, my team and I created more than 106 rules and developed the technology to accurately predict how many chargebacks we could expect, and what their risk levels were.

 
In about three months, we got the majority of our funds released. Then risk managers started calling me about merchants who were having similar problems.

I am litigating this case with my colleague Matt Topic and the rest of the Transparency Team at Loevy &amp; Loevy.  Matt is best known for being the lead attorney in the Laquan McDonald shooting video case as well as this case.  We have also forced the release of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s “private” emails and countless more police shooting videos in Illinois.

While there are a small number of other attorneys who do this type of work, almost all of them work in-house for organizations.  As far as I am aware we are the only team in the country doing this work at a private firm full-time and representing both major media organizations and regular people.  We are able to represent regular people at no charge because under the Freedom of Information Act when we win a case the government has to pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs.

Ask me anything about hitchhiking, bummit, the charities, or anything else!!!",23,1583504960,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fee81h/i_am_hitchhiking_over_1000_miles_from_my/,IAmA,1
fedzxh,Georgy_K_Zhukov,"[X-Post AskHistorians] AMA with Dr. Rachel Herrmann, here to talk about her new book, ""No Useless Mouth: Waging War and Fighting Hunger in the American Revolution""","#[Link to the AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fedsud/hello_again_redditors_im_dr_rachel_herrmann_ill/)

&gt; In the era of the American Revolution, the rituals of diplomacy between the British, Patriots, and Native Americans featured gifts of food, ceremonial feasts, and a shared experience of hunger. When diplomacy failed, Native Americans could destroy food stores and cut off supply chains in order to assert authority. Black colonists also stole and destroyed food to ward off hunger and carve out tenuous spaces of freedom. Hunger was a means of power and a weapon of war.
&gt; 
&gt; In No Useless Mouth, Rachel B. Herrmann argues that Native Americans and formerly enslaved black colonists ultimately lost the battle against hunger and the larger struggle for power because white British and United States officials curtailed the abilities of men and women to fight hunger on their own terms. By describing three interrelated behaviors—food diplomacy, victual imperialism, and victual warfare—the book shows that, during this tumultuous period, hunger prevention efforts offered strategies to claim power, maintain communities, and keep rival societies at bay.
&gt; 
&gt; Herrmann shows how Native Americans, free blacks, and enslaved peoples were ""useful mouths""—not mere supplicants for food, without rights or power—who used hunger for cooperation and violence, and took steps to circumvent starvation. Her wide-ranging research on black Loyalists, Iroquois, Cherokee, Creek, and Western Confederacy Indians demonstrates that hunger creation and prevention were tools of diplomacy and warfare available to all people involved in the American Revolution. Placing hunger at the center of these struggles foregrounds the contingency and plurality of power in the British Atlantic during the Revolutionary Era.",1,1583503901,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fedzxh/xpost_askhistorians_ama_with_dr_rachel_herrmann/,IAmA,1

Hi everybody, I am Remi, CEO of Supercombo, Inc. My partner Josh K. and myself are veterans of the CG and VFX industry. In 2016, we both decided to make the jump and quit our cushy jobs (we met working at Apple, inc.) in order to follow our lifelong dream of making Video games for a living. It has been a brutal financial &amp; emotional roller coaster, and we have put ourselves, our families through a lot... but 3-4 years later after many ups and downs, we finally released our crowdfunding campaign for our debut title ARCANIUM: Rise of Akhan.

ARCANIUM is an ambitious Single-player Strategy Card game of epic proportions, that merges both ""Roguelike"" &amp; ""Deckbuilding"" genres in many new ways. The game is a tale of fellowship and bravery, and is set in a fantasy World of anthropomorphic animals where good, evil, magic and technology collide. Form a party of three adventurers and embark on your dangerous journey in order to defeat Akhan the Calamity, and save the World of Arzu from destruction.

ARCANIUM is directly inspired by epic tales like ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkien, and by some of our favorite games like Slay the Spire (Megacrit), Faster than light (Subset Games), Hearthstone (Blizzard Ent.), and classic RPG games like Diablo (Blizzard Ent.) and Baldur's Gate (Bioware). And if you squint your eyes hard enough, you might notice some more traditional board game elements as well!

Although the game is far from being a complete product, having released the game in pre-alpha publicly is a huge personal victory for us, and we are very proud of ourselves for having made it that far. We love our game and hope that you will love it too!

We know that, just like us, many aspiring game developers are in the same boat, wondering whether they, too, should launch themselves into the cut-throat business of indie game development. We aren't veterans or seasoned game devs yet, but we definitely have an advice or two to share with you. We are here to answer honestly all your questions, including the hard ones. Let's have fun and ask us anything!

fdemjd,MRIGlobal,We are researchers at MRIGlobal developing testing methods ＆ biosafety procedures for COVID-19 ＆ will test the efficacy of the vaccine. AUA!,".Hello, Reddit! 

MRIGlobal conducts applied scientific and engineering research impacting the health and safety of millions of people each year. Since our founding in 1944, we have earned a reputation for expertise in infectious disease, supporting our clients to predict, prevent, and control outbreaks such as Ebola and other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. 

Today, we are fighting against COVID-19 (AKA SARS-CoV-2 corona virus). 
We help our commercial and government stakeholders in three areas: 

1) Evaluate the efficacy and safety of vaccines and therapeutics and develop diagnostic assays to detect COVID-19 in patients and in the environment. 

2) Develop and share biosafety procedures and offer subject matter expertise and training to partner organizations working with SARS-CoV-2 corona virus and COVID-19 and 

3) Develop and deploy flyable infectious disease biocontainment systems and mobile diagnostic laboratories that can be fielded wherever needed.

We are working with industry partners to provide cutting-edge solutions for COVID-19 in the USA and globally. Initially, our focus is developing Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) assays, followed by further testing to obtain FDA clearance for the diagnostic assays. In addition, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vaccines and therapeutics, including efforts to discover new antiviral candidates. Simultaneously, we are ramping up teams to support human clinical trials of medical countermeasures that are now under development. With our infectious disease expertise, we are positioned to study the virus and its transmission. As leaders in biosafety with pandemic preparedness expertise, we are sharing our knowledge with the community and businesses.

Our work makes a difference in the health outcomes of people around the globe facing the challenges of infectious disease. MRIGlobal’s subject matter experts have unsurpassed research and technical expertise. That level of scientific excellence is what every client deserves and demands. But we provide so much more: a personal relationship with our scientists who partner with our clients to find customized solutions to their specific challenges.

fdb0w2,Novel-Rule,"I am Kevin Rudd, former Prime Minister of Australia! AMA!","Hi folks,

There’s been a lot of response from around Australia on my calls over recent months for a royal commission into the future ownership and diversity of Australian media – in particular for such a royal commission to examine the abuse of power by the Murdoch media in Australia. I have described the Murdoch media not as a legitimate news organisation but indeed a political party seeking to advance its own commercial and ideological interests. I’ve also described Murdoch as a cancer on democracy, not just in this country, but in the United Kingdom and the United States.

My experience of the Murdoch media is canvassed extensively in the book I’ve recently published entitled Kevin Rudd The PM Years. It deals with the Murdoch medias campaign to destroy the National Broadband Network of fibre optic to the premises in order to advance Murdoch’s commercial interests in protecting the Foxtel cable based entertainment network in Australia. My book also details the vicious nature of Murdoch’s campaign against my government in the 2013 election. Also you may have seen the [attached opinion piece](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/citizen-murdoch-s-critical-grip-on-democracy-20190104-p50pkw.html) I wrote in last Saturdays Fairfax media on what Murdoch may seek to do next in seeking to ingratiate himself with the Labor party prior to the next election.

If you wish to discuss these and any other related matters then Reddit, Ask Me Anything!

I’ll be answering questions this afternoon from 4:30pm to 6pm AEST. That’s 5:30pm to 7pm AEDT. Other times as applicable depending on where in this fair country of ours you happen to live.

fd77pt,ElectricFlowmaster,"IAmA...5th Year Apprentice in IBEW L.U. 613 who is 30 days away from earning my JW ticket, AMA!","AMA please... because I would like to share. But in return you have to come up with some questions. So ask me some questions. This might be fun if enough people contribute. (If you wanted some generic backstory to save the chatter and incentivize your thoughts to ask something different from what I have briefly mentioned - great - that is the point.)

I have been at this particular endeavor for over 6 years, and it has been a fuck of a task. Nothing in life worth having comes easy, it is said. I am a firm believer in cliches existing for a reason, similar to the way I think our elders have experienced things for us to draw upon in summation to thrive. I started this quest in order to make a significant change in my life to make my situation better in my personal quest to continue my creative expressions in the most effective way of longevity possible.
See, I don't plan on being a one-dimensional type of artist/creative person. Writing lyrics, creating cadences, visualizing concepts to simplify to others, teaching those who listen, verbalizing my thought processes and exercising my thoughts... Lyrically at first, then through the sounds I pick to harmonize over, then the music itself I will create as I make visual elements match these things I express. Truth be told, I am not the best entrepreneur, but I do have a certain diligence about me when it comes to the things I truly pursue. I understand numerous things and I have much more to learn.

In this quest to do such observations of existence, I chose to pursue a trade. I was always a builder and modifier of things. Anyone familiar with K'nex? I grew up building some of those things and tweaking the designs from the instructions. But trade work was never a thing I noticed in my regular life. No one else did it that I knew or could really draw experience from. So that makes the most default route to success in life lit by a light of education. Schools, Colleges, Universities, et cetera and so on, yada, blah, normal ""sit down and listen"" life ideas. I was never really the person to listen to any person with a tie and take every word they say as genius or gospel. I liked to listen with a grain of salt - and tended to gloss over at points that tangented from what I was hearing. I didn't always bother to interrupt people as they talked, but I do have that type of wayward mind. Often when I contribute my mind it is very out there. So I chill and let people be as I am myself.
That being said, I truly want to do this discussion to aid other apprentices, first and foremost. Never really realized reddit was a source of solace for some of you guys until recently. I have lurked on reddit plenty, but my contributions were minor until now. I have something to say, and it's not going to be said all at the same time. Because that would be yelling. Humor

...I have gotten off track. I will bring this back to a quick point here...So many things have occurred during my apprenticeship that I can hardly explain in a coherent fashion.

I got into this thing because it was the best choice for me to sustain myself as I saw fit. Not just as a job or a career, but as the key to unlock my own excellence. I honestly thought this kind of thing was too good to be true by the way I was hearing it, having worked regular shit jobs (and a few good ones) before taking on the challenge. You kind of get used to that pattern of living. The 9-to-5 rat race, they call it. Get out of that shit, people. I think that's also contributing to the climate crisis. Work different hours, better locations. Demand it. Make it known to someone else. (I have NO documentation to back up that claim, but I am aware that the basic action of industries functioning contributes to this mess. We can solve it, but if that discussion is to be fully explored, perhaps not in this particular post? I love to tangent but let's stay relatively on topic for parts of this. (This AMA could go anywhere)..

I always wanted to do a trade, but never cared enough to try to understand how to really make this kind of thing work until it appeared in front of me. When that type of thing happens you typically shouldn't shy away from it. There's never a good time to do these things, but I harnessed my inner Tyler Durden, roll through a very tough segment of your life with your own self-inspired direction.

I feel like I could write an entire 4-walled room of text about this (because I spent 6 years gathering the experience), and eventually I may, but I wanted to start somewhere to bring you all up to speed on how this thing can go if you participate.

fd1al8,MATSE_Tim,I am the first legally deafblind guy who graduated from a normal high school in Germany and am now studying applied maths and computer science. Ask me Anything!,"Dear curious people of Reddit,

I did [an AmA before](https://reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/dz40j7/im_legally_deafblind_and_studying_applied_maths/) but every time I mention my disability I trigger a flood of questions again, and most of those questions I never got asked before.

So, feel free to ask me anything again :-)

Background: I was probably born vision impaired (VI). Officially got declared legally blind at age two, but wasn't 100 % blind. I can still see light in my left eye, but only vaguely, no definite shapes, colours, distance assessment. In the right eye I'm fully blind (nulla lux) since 2017.

My hearing started getting worse when I was five, six years old, so I learned talking normally. Got my first set of hearing aids at age seven, and a cochlea implant on the right side at age 13. Got declared legally deafblind at age 16.

I spent three weeks in youth psychiatry after a burn out/medium severe episode (depression which only occured once so far) combined with suicidality and was in long term treatment until 2019. Still managed to graduate from a normal high school (with an average of 1.3 (A-)) as the first legally deafblind guy in Germany in 2018.

Now, since September 2019, I'm studying applied maths and computer science an&gt; am employed as a mathematical-technical software developer in training. Also living alone and making my very own ""so this is how adult life works?""-mistakes.

Looking forward to your questions!

I quarreled with almost all my friends, broke up with the girl, tried dozens of prescription drugs and a bunch of droppers. But now I feel better. Ask your questions.

fbzj7h,tempaccnt120,"Former fashion model, bio MSc, Kpop trainee, composer, and now retired since 20s. Ask me anything about life.","I am Hieon.

I graduated with bio MSc and double major in music composition and jazz performance. But I became a kpop trainee, for now a famous kpop group, chasing after fame.

However I did not agree with the musical direction, thus quit and took an alternate route as a fashion/commercial model.

Then I made mistakes in life which led me to not go outside for years, only going out for groceries and otherwise staying home alone. 

I am not rich, but a small fortune from my 20s allowed that kind of lifestyle to persist. And so I realized I was retired since mid 20s, inadvertently.

I did a previous IAMA last year and started video journals in another attempt to change or try something. I plan to do this once every year as an update.

But I am still not much any different. I stay home all day, study &amp; read, waste time, and only go out for groceries.

Hence after all, I am no one special.

I am just a person wanting to live as long as I can.

I am here to be asked and talk about life.

Anything from my career, lifestyle, past, medical science, music, theories, and just my thoughts on anything.

Ask me anything.

Sincerely,
Hieon

fbv3qc,Furisado,"Hello im Ian. 2 years ago i was institucionalized in a psych ward at 17, after going on an elimination diet today i just participated in a 5k race. AMA!","I used to suffer from severe paranoia, anxiety, depression, OCD and for sometime schizophrenia. I didnt have any energy went through countless panic attacks, at some point i was having 6-7 h panic attacks (not a typo), daily insomnia, when i was hospitalized i hadnt showered in over a month and was paranoid locked in my room all day everyday didnt leave my room, depressed as shit all the time, top of that and what i think is the cause for most of my trauma my parents were/are abusive pieces of shit, used to scream all the time with my mother which i lived with , and still live with today. 
Anyway a year after i left the hospital(still dealing with everything above) i saw one of mikhaila peterson's talks about her problems since she was a child and how she got rid of them through her diet  and then heard Dr. Rhonda patrick on the JRE podcast talking about the beneficial effects of the sauna ,i just forced my self to go to the one in my apartment, felt great so i kept doing it and felt better than i ever did taking any meds in my whole life, this got me the confidence to change my diet, i cut gluten and felt amazing benefits to my mood, turns out i had celiac disease, okay but then really weird stuff happened i wasnt having anymore panic attacks, my thoughts were becoming clearer, depression and OCD started to diminish i was becoming able to handle conversations. Then i cut sugar or at least diminished how much i ate, no more sugary drinks only water and coffee, around this time i cut my medication(stilnox) because of how well i was feeling.
Amazingly i was able to deal with having no meds and things got better and better and better i started leaving the house and actually socializing with people,went to the gym, got better sleep no more insomnia, i eventually cut sugar out completely, the son of a bitch is a hell of a drug. I could list off a thousand more benefits and things but this post is already getting long.

I signed up for a 5k run and today i ran it. I havent taken any medication in 6 months.

fbq6f1,cbolanos95,The one-legged Jamaican homeless guy.,"The first time I seen this man was when I was 11 years old. His hair was brown he had a nice smile each time you saw him and he smoked alot of weed. I've seen him from time to time, till I was in high school some guy told me that he tried to give him some Burger King and he smacked it out of the person's hand . The guy got Soo mad he threw away the food lol. Years pass by and I just recently seen this man smoking a joint in front of a pharmacy. The reason why I'm mentioning this man that I barely know is because keep in mind he lives in New Jerseys urban area and has been homeless for over 10 years. This man survived 2 hurricanes, blizzards, extreme heat, very heavy rainfall. Honestly he's the definition of versatile even though he doesn't have a happy life , he always gets by. If that's not inspiration to keep on moving I don't know what is. Was going to actually start a go fund me page to at least give him some money to get back on his feet. Here's a video of the homeless man hitting another homeless guy with his crutches lol.

fbof58,tempaccnt120,"Former model, Bio MSc, musician, Kpop trainee, hikikomori, and retired since 20s; just living. An update IAMA, Ask Me Anything","I am Hieon.

I graduated with bio MSc and double major in music composition and jazz performance. But I became a kpop trainee, for now a famous kpop group, chasing after fame.

However I did not agree with the musical direction, thus quit and took an alternate route as a fashion/commercial model.

Then I made grave mistakes. And I lost someone. I gave up everything; career, socializing, prospects, going out, and life.

I do not define myself as a hikikomori but that is the simplest term for how I was. For more than 5 years I did not go outside, only going out for groceries, and just living with no purpose. Yet I was too selfish to suicide.

I am not rich, but a small fortune from my 20s allowed that kind of lifestyle to persist. And so I realized I was retired, inadvertently.

I spent another 2-3 years trying to change and reverting back to detrimental state and rinse &amp; repeat.

I did a previous IAMA last year and started video journals in another attempt to change. I deleted it because I didn't expect people to take me as mentally ill or a cry-for-help, and only giving me condescending advices.

I just wanted to be asked of any questions related to my life or anything. I plan to do this once every year as an update.

I am still not much different. I stay home all day, study &amp; read, waste time, and only go out for groceries.

Neither happy nor depressed, living each day without a purpose.

fawh65,MDCTranslations,"Hello! I am Iris Thesmar and I am the editor of the French translation of the Massachusetts Daily Collegian. I can answer questions in French and English! Please ask me anything, about translation work or editor's job!","I am a French native speaker, and this is my first year working as an editor for French translated articles. I am fluent in both English and French, and I have a good experience in translation. Most of my work was for my own gain, but I have now started to work professionally. The Massachusetts Daily Collegian has a rather large network, where the articles written by the journalists can be translated in languages such as Spanish, German, Chinese, or Arabic. 

**Why do I translate?**

I was born in France and studied French as first language for 18 years, Still today, I take the classes in College. I came in America a few years ago, which makes my English slightly less good than my French. I came to love translation as I read more books in two languages, and started to notice the enormous difference in writing, and how going from English to French made my mind work hard, and well. I just love languages, and I think that it is one thing to want to learn a language, and it is another thing to appreciate it. I just want to spread something I love. 

Marjane Satrapi said about translation that it was ""like a woman ; either beautiful or faithful."" While it is a very loose analogy, I find it quite true, in the sense that it hard to convey both of those things. It is my job to make sure that both of those sides of translation be as present as possible.

faf6fq,Free_Office_Finder,Looking for feedback – a price comparison tool for serviced office space,"# Hi, we’re [FreeOfficeFinder](https://www.freeofficefinder.com/) - an online broker for serviced offices and have been around for nearly 20 years.

We had an idea for a unique tool a couple of years ago which we finally launched last month – It is an interactive price comparison tool for private serviced offices and coworking space in London and the UK. The tool is the first of its kind and it took us nearly a year to form the concept, design and build it. We actually struggled to design it as it hadn’t been done before and we just didn’t know how the tool should work.

The tool currently offers both current and historical pricing data for 80 of the UK’s most popular locations.

We realised people in the early stages of their office search struggled to understand the difference in pricing for each area and the applicable price for the number of desks they needed. This is why we decided to develop the tool, as it allows users to compare the average price for serviced offices and coworking in their chosen areas (and discover other areas they perhaps hadn’t considered).

The second part of the tool is historical data, which allows you to see how the market has changed (showing prices of offices going back to 2015). We decided that instead of forcing semi-interesting graphs of prices that people didn’t ask for, we would allow people to build their own graphs for the areas and date ranges that they want to see.

We take the data from over 2000 serviced offices we market, and we will be updating it quarterly.

Industry feedback so far has been incredible, and it’s even been featured in PropertyWeek which is one of the biggest property news sites in the UK, however, we would love some user feedback from people outside of the industry.

**There are two pages for the tool which interlink…**

**Current prices:** [https://www.freeofficefinder.com/pricing-tool](https://www.freeofficefinder.com/pricing-tool)

**Historical prices:** [https://www.freeofficefinder.com/pricing-tool/historical](https://www.freeofficefinder.com/pricing-tool/historical)

Any feedback you have would be really appreciated!

Or ask us anything – the design, the concept, the build process, pricing, etc

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!

faelih,ajplus,"I'm Tiffany Ran, a Taiwanese American food writer and chef skilled at preparing geoduck, a phallic clam that's a delicacy in East Asia because of its ""Q texture."" It seems like East Asian food choices are being scrutinized a lot in the West lately, hopefully I can clear things up for you all. AMA!","Hi! I’m Tiffany Ran. I’m a chef and food writer focusing on Taiwanese cuisine. I recently appeared on the AJ  show “In Real Life” to talk about the geoduck, which is a funny-looking clam that’s hugely popular in East Asia and can cost as much as $300 at a restaurant! You can watch the episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrsPxHbbOqo). 

 A lot of news articles claim the geoduck's high demand in China is because it's a ""virility food"" – like an aphrodisiac of some sort. I'll admit, it does look ... a certain way. But, in my experience, that's not really true and a misrepresentation of Chinese/Taiwanese food. The geoduck's popularity, like most foods, comes down to its flavor, the status symbol it represents, and, most importantly, its unique texture. In Taiwanese, we refer to this texture as “Q” (or sometimes “QQ”). Think of it as ""al dente,"" but much bouncier and more buoyant – like boba (bubble tea), mochi or super thick rice noodles. 

 As for me, I’ve also written about food for [Vice Munchies](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3d337w/meet-the-woman-who-is-preserving-taiwans-street-food-tradition) and [Goldthread](https://www.goldthread2.com/food/taiwan-bottarga-luxury/article/3020241), and I spend my time in between Taiwan and Seattle. I’m in Seattle now and am ready to answer your questions. 

 Yara Elmjouie, the host of “In Real Life,” who helped me prep the geoduck (and actually dug one up), is here too to answer your questions about geoduck. Ask us anything!

fad232,keenan_twinoaks,"Since 1983, I have lived, worked and raised a family in a progressive, egalitarian, income-sharing intentional community (or commune) of 100 people in rural Virginia. AMA.","Hello Reddit! 

My name is Keenan Dakota, I have lived at Twin Oaks, an income-sharing, intentional community in rural Virginia for 36 years, since 1983. I grew up in northern Virginia, my parents worked in government. I went to George Mason University where I studied business management. I joined Twin Oaks when I was 23 because I lost faith in the underpinnings of capitalism and looking for a better model. I have stayed because over time capitalism hasn't looked any better, and its a great place to raise children. While at Twin Oaks, I raised two boys to adulthood, constructed several buildings, managed the building maintenance program, have managed some of the business lines at different times. 

[Proof this is me](https://imgur.com/9PMIYvv). [A younger photo of me at Twin Oaks.](https://www.twinoaks.org/photo-gallery/people-pets-twinoaks/portraits-oakers-friends?i=w_keenan) [Here is a video interview of me about living at Twin Oaks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzaAmgFS7B4) [Photo of Twin Oaks members at the 50th anniversary.](https://www.twinoaks.org/images/igallery/resized/1701-1800/50thAnniversaryGroupPic_perAaron-1715-3600-1200-100-c.jpg)

Some things that make life here different from the mainstream:

* The labor system - all work is considered equal, whether you are earning income for the community or not. Cooking/cleaning counts the same as planning the annual budget. Also, you don't have to do the same job all week - your day can be a mix of indoor and outdoor work, you have freedom to arrange your day, and you can gain skills in a wide array of tasks and trades. 
* Non-gender binary, queer and trans people are very welcome at Twin Oaks. People introduce themselves with their pronouns and a significant number of our members go by they/them.
* Verbal consent culture is very important here. It is not okay to touch anyone without asking.
* Nudity and partial nudity is allowed in some parts of the farm, such as in the sauna, swimming hole, on the hiking trails, etc. 
* Our social norms prohibit using phones in common areas when other members are present, with the exception of a few cafe-style spaces. 
* Every day we provide a home-cooked, plant-based lunch and dinner with options for special diets including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and no onions &amp; garlic. 
* Raising kids here is easier. Some of the time that parents spend raising their children counts towards their labor quota. Many of the kids are home-schooled or un-schooled, and they spend more time outside than in front of a screen. 
* We have a shared clothing resource called Commie Clothes, which is like a free thrift store. Borrow something and then return it dirty, and it gets washed and re-hung up.   

More about [Twin Oaks](https://www.twinoaks.org/about-twinoaks-community/welcome):

Twin Oaks is an [intentional community](http://www.ic.org/) in rural central Virginia, made up of around 90 adult members and 15 children. Since the community's beginning in 1967, our way of life has reflected our values of cooperation, sharing, nonviolence, equality, and ecology. 

We do not have a group religion; our beliefs are diverse. We do not have a central leader; we govern ourselves by a form of democracy with responsibility shared among various managers, planners, and committees. We are self-supporting economically, and partly self-sufficient. We are income-sharing. Each member works 42 hours a week in the community's business and domestic areas. Each member receives housing, food, healthcare, and personal spending money from the community.

We have open-slots and are accepting applications for new members. All prospective new members must participate in a [three-week visitor program](https://www.twinoaks.org/twinoaks-visits-60/visit-tour/visitor-program).

I grew up in poverty and suffering bouts of homelessness. When I was 16 I went out on my own and made enough money buying and selling cars to attend college.

f9v6n4,to-strong,"I am a former Cal Lutheran student when the Borderline Shooting (11-7-18) &amp; Woolsey Fire happened in Thousand Oaks, California.","Hi Reddit, my name is Brandon.

I made this account to share my side of view for anyone to understand what the aftermath felt like when a mass shooting and uncontrollable fires occurred. I really wanted to express my thoughts and feelings when this event happened.

I am from Ventura County (VC) and was attending college at Cal Lutheran as a senior in the 2018-2019 year. The first few days of November 2018 had some of the best sunsets I've ever seen. I remember them so clear and colorful, I thought it was going to be a fantastic month since my Birthday was also later that month on Thanksgiving.

Now it was November 7th. The day was pretty normal, went to work at my internship from 8am-12pm, went to my two afternoon classes and was studying for an upcoming midterm in my dorm for the entire night. Wednesday nights were College nights at Borderline, I never had a chance to go to one prior because of my schedule.

Then it was almost midnight and was saying goodnight to one of my roommates until he said to me, ""Hey, did you hear about Borderline?"" I said, ""No, what about it?"" My roommate replied back, ""There's a shooting"".

I was speechless. My other roommates were informed and we turn on the TV and there we saw outside Borderline police and everything. A time where I was about to go to sleep exhausted, I was now wide awake and shocked. I watched until 1am at the time there were no casualties reported, so I went to sleep hoping that this was not reality.

I also realized that 4 of my friends were also there. I found two of them through Snapchat (one of them was Justin Meek; the bouncer at Borderline). I had a friend ask me about Justin so I screenshot him the location from Snapchat.

I barely went to sleep that night. Most of it was replying to family, relatives, friends, and people I haven't talked to since middle school asking if I'm okay.

Eventually, I found out that 12 people passed away. Three out of my four friends survived the shooting. Two of them were able to go through the broken glass windows and escaped with minor injuries, one of them (who had half a knee, couldn't run so he laid on the floor and acted 'dead'. He was eventually rescued by police but survived. As for Justin Meek, he did not make it. He was one of the 12 lives lost that night of November 7th, 2018.

My boss eventually texted me and said to not come in, but I came in later that day but not after visiting the church at our campus and sending some prayers. 

After I went to work (which was only an hour or so), I came back to campus and classes were canceled for a few days because of the shooting and because of the soon startup of the Woolsey Fire that started to spread to VC.

The Woolsey Fire was starting to reach parts of VC and eventually we lost our internet for a good half-day or so. Our campus was like a ghost town, seeing nothing but orange and red around the mountains, the smell of smoke in the air, and feeling lost for hope. I eventually left at 4:15am when the campus alert notification said to be on standby, but at that time there were not many people on campus. In the meantime, I was traveling to all parts of Thousand Oaks doing what I could to help send prayers, comfort those around me, and for supporting the fallen Sgt. Ron Helus. 

What I did was I grabbed my Pro Police Flag from my dorm the night prior and went outside my campus and waved the flag for support to all police officers. I even had a chance to go right outside their command post and do that there as well. Reporters from the area interviewed me as well as the Australian ABC News (I will post the links at the bottom). I had an officer come to me right outside the command post and drove me to the command post station and welcomed me to a luncheon that a catering company donated because of a wedding that got postponed. I was thanked by officers and volunteers for my encouragement and for what I did. I wasn't doing this for fame, I was doing this because  I strongly support the police and this was a time that they needed the support from people like me at the time. 

A few days later, I went to Sgt. Ron Helus' memorial for an hour (because I had class) and was there once again with the Pro Police Flag. (Again, I was there for support and not looking for fame) and had a few more reporters ask me questions, one of which was L.A. Times. 

As for my classes, the professors were shocked, surprised, and speechless when the day after the shooting happened. It was a terrible turn of events that I turned around.

Eventually, I got to celebrate my birthday later that month with family up NorCal. Later the following year (May 2019), I graduated!

I am more than happy to answer the questions that you have. I wanted to post this to those who wanted to know what exactly happens and affects people like me in this double-tragedy situation.

**Right now, I would love the opportunity to spill my secrets and steer you in the right direction so you can create a fun, puzzle filled day for a loved one**. So I’m trying something out (That I might regret later but oh well) 

Go ahead and give me your parameters. Say you’ve always wanted to create a twisting turning day for someone, hit me with some information and I’ll try to help you build an outline and throw in a few gambits to help give you somewhere to start. Give me the basic location (city), the occasion, and maybe a level of difficulty  and I’ll try to find a few spots and give you a few gambits so you feel comfortable building the adventure yourself!

That being said, you can ask me anything about Business, travel, or how it feels to get deported from Canada (it's not as exciting as you'd think).

The only thing I’m really plugging (other than shamelessly begging for publicity) is for you to join me over at r/constructedadventures. It’s a promotion free subreddit created to try to help people build adventures for their loved ones. Myself and a few of my proteges are active there! Come ask questions or contribute ideas!

I’m Nick Leeson, today is my birthday.

It is also 25 years ago today since I broke the UK’s oldest merchant bank with illegal losing trades of over 1.4 billion dollars and the phrase, ‘Rogue Trader’ was coined.

I was 28, the place was Singapore, and the bank was the Queen's own Barings PLC.

Things went bad fast, two days prior I fled Singapore and faxed back a note to the bank with just the words “I’m sorry”

I realised how bad, when waking up at the Shangri La Hotel in Kota Kinabalu. The Asian Wall Street Journal had been slid under the door, picking it up, the front-page headline read ' British Bank collapse'.

I decided I needed to get further away, back to England. I boarded a flight back that day via Germany. The plane was met on the runway in Frankfurt by German police.

I was extradited, sentenced to 6 and ½ years in a Triad led prison in Singapore. I got cancer, spent a month in solitary, wrote a book, had a movie made about me starring Ewan McGregor and served 4 ½ years for good behaviour.

I am now back trading and you can follow along at bullandbearcap.com.

Ask me anything!,"I am a researcher with the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, founder of [Skeptical Science](http://skepticalscience.com/), and creator of Cranky Uncle. For the last decade, I've researched how to counter misinformation about climate change. I now combine critical thinking, climate science, cartoons, and comedy to build resilience against misinformation. 

All this research is on display in a new book I've just published: Cranky Uncle vs. Climate Change. I'm also developing a ""Cranky Uncle"" smartphone game that uses gamification and cartoons to teach players resilience against misinformation. More book and game details at [https://crankyuncle.com](https://crankyuncle.com)

I've published [many research papers](http://sks.to/johncook) on these topics which you can access at . This includes research finding [97% scientific consensus on human-caused global warming](http://sks.to/tcppaper) (a study that has inspired many comments over the years and I’m sure will spark a few questions here). During my PhD, I published research finding that [inoculation is a powerful tool to neutralize misinformation](http://sks.to/inoculation): we can stop science denial from spreading by exposing people to a weakened form of science denial. I’ve published research that uses [critical thinking to deconstruct and analyze misinformation](http://sks.to/criticalclimate) in order to identify reasoning fallacies. I also led a collaboration between the University of Queensland and Skeptical Science that developed the [Massive Open Online Course: Making Sense of Climate Science Denial](http://sks.to/denial101x).

I started programming since 13(I am now 29) and was mentored every day by a wall-street veteran for 2 years. Going to UCLA I was major in Mathematics, Economics w a specialized in computation but I got Cs from most of the courses. After graduating I self-taught Hardware Engineer and Mechanical Design dreaming one day I would start a hardware startup.

I will have to do a talk show ask me anything soon so I went here to read people's posts and learn from it. After reading many posts on here I see what makes me different than others is that I have a wide knowledge from mathematics, engineer to arts and derivative trading and I even work in those fields BUT I SUCK AT ALL OF THEM.

How? By building [The W'ALL](https://wallaustin.com/).

Unlike border walls that divide, this is a wall for unity. The piece is a giant sculpture and art wall covered in tens of thousands of uplifting or meaningful song lyrics submitted by people from all over the world. With each lyric submitted on our website, a donation can be added to support charities fighting for equality.

It's been a long and at times wacky process to get to the construction phase, but we launched in early Feb and already have submissions from 15 different countries, Grammy winners, and many hundreds of music fans.

Please add your lyrics to our project on [wallaustin.com](https://wallaustin.com/) and follow our progress on Instagram @w_allaustin and facebook @thewallaustin.

Bio - I started exercising when I was about 11 years old. Growing up it was pretty much the only hobby of mine. I started with just pushups and sit-ups and as I got older I expanded my horizons. A few years back, I visited China and realized it was difficult to find a gym. Then I realized the food wasn’t very healthy, nor were there any real fit people, unlike in the USA where going to the gym was part of a normal lifestyle. I felt China was growing at a rapid pace and I wanted to be a part of this rapid growth. I feel if I can workout, then the Chinese people can do it as well. Americas way of training is different than the Chinese way And that’s why I’m here.

2014 - I sold my car and took whatever cash I had to start the business. We were a small team of 3 people, basically a girl I met at a bar (who liked me) and her girlfriend. We opened in a very old building to keep rent costs low.

Once opened, it was hilarious as no one really came the first couple of months (hilarious now, extremely stressful then). Our way of reaching the market included word of mouth referrals, handing out flyers on the street, talking to strangers at coffee shops, massage salons, nail salons, and nightclubs. I even went on a Chinese dating show to try to get my name out.

After about two to three years, the business was finally doing well. It was almost automatic, whereas I didn’t have to be there that much. So what happened? Relationships man, I can’t imagine what Johnny Depp and Tiger Woods went through. She constantly threatened to close the business down and it eventually happened. However, even though I closed, I knew the system I had was feasible. And others who saw my gym run as well. Also at this time, I wanted to work with others, because I was doing it on my own for the last 2-3 years. It felt lonely.

2017 - This was the year where Beijing had a surge of fitness centers all over the city. I knew this guy, let’s just call him Mr.A. He wanted to open a coffeeshop/bar/something to do for his family. The space was three floors and he offered me the basement to run classes. I was a minority partner and couldn’t make business decisions. He dropped a ton of cash to get it running. Mr. A has money, but he let his family, who didn’t have experience, make business decisions. From construction to operations, it just wasn’t executed well. After about a year, the overhead of the coffeeshop was just too high and resulted in closing.

2018 - Another guy, lets call him Mr. B, wanted to get on the bandwagon. He was living in an “office space” life (Which I’ve also been through myself) and approached me to run a gym with him. We tried to establish in the center of a business district and the rent was much higher than my first gym. I warned him that we should be minimalistic, but he wanted to be “high class”. I was also a minority partner and I couldn’t make business decisions for this gym as well. He thought he would have a lot of “friends” to back him up. The planning for this gym was too hastily and after about six months, we ended up closing because we ran out of cash.

2019 - So what did I learn from this? That I need to be in control. Allow others to give business advice, but the decision must be made on your own. And that’s what I did. I opened a minimalistic gym located between the three previous gyms.

Being an anonymous kidney donor was the best decision I have ever made. Relieving suffering &amp; saving lives is our shared human mission. Our 2nd kidney is not needed for our survival. It’s a vestigial organ, like our appendix. This spare kidney has the power to save strangers' lives. For those who are in top health, consider giving a part of yourself so others can live.

My kidney donation started a chain that provided kidneys for four people, achieving the maximum good from a single gift as an effective altruist does. In order to receive a kidney, my recipient’s loved one volunteered to donate a kidney to a stranger. The recipient of that second kidney had someone donate and so on until a total of four people received new kidneys.

f7w07j,thepoliticalrev,"Hello! My name is Nathaniel Mulcahy. I am a progressive, an engineer, and a scientist who is challenging Seth Moulton in MA-6. Ask Me Anything! [x-post r/Political_Revolution]","###[Link to AMA on /r/Political_Revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/f7va6y/hello_my_name_is_nathaniel_mulcahy_i_am_a/)
---

 **My Background:** Early in my career I had the honor of teaching k-6 in the South Bronx, both in public and private schools. Following this period, I returned to school to achieve degrees in engineering, and began my career as a scientist, inventor, and an engineer.  

In my career I've had the privilege of working on projects as varied as the Gillette Venus to locking mechanisms of the Space Shuttle Bay Doors.

Further, I started my own humanitarian engineering company *WorldStove*. This was the first company in the world to be certified as carbon negative.   
 

Additionally, I have been involved in the United Nations Climate Summits since 2008, and have been an adviser to the European Parliament on Climate Policy and Solutions. 

**My Platform:** I am a bold Bernie Sanders Democrat. 

**Global Warming**: I will fight for the Green New Deal. Without immediate, drastic action to combat rising C02 levels, the planet will be left in a global crisis. 

**Money in Politics:**  I reject the corrupting influence of corporate money, and money from the wealthy elite. We must reverse citizens united, and make it clear that money is not speech. Additionally, we must enact Publicly Funded Elections as to allow the average citizen to run for political office. 

**Health Care**: Medicare for all, period. No compromises, no watered down half measures. America spends more than any major country on health care, yet we get less access and worse healthcare outcomes. It is time to catch up with the rest of the modern world. 

**Free College and Trade Schools:** To remain competitive within the global market, we must implement tuition and fee free college education at public universities. Trade schools also need to be free. 

**A living wage**: I stand firmly behind the Fight For $15. 50% of US residents are struggling to pay for basic life necessities such as food, rent, and heat. Wages have been stagnating since the 1980s, while the top 1% of earners have seen their wealth increase dramatically. Raising the minimum wage is one way to help combat this moral failing within the US economy.

ii. **Contributions**: We believe in publicly financed campaigns. Unfortunately, those don't exist at this time. Should you wish to contribute to our campaign, you can donate here, which we really appreciate.

iii. **Social Media:** we need help spreading our message to stand any chance at defeating Seth Moulton. Please consider following the campaign on social media, and spreading Nathaniel’s campaign to those within your social circle.

I will be 30 here soon and I have a sister who will be 29 shortly after. My mom is now 57 my dad 51. We were an Air Force family growing up. Mom never worked, only my dad. In 1999 my dad got a job at a prison. Around 6yrs old I started to notice that the family wasn't quite normal... Not that I could compare to anyone else. We didn't go to public school or have an kid friends to hang out with. I have witnessed a lot of physical violence between my mom and dad... Throwing things, chasing each other with weapons, physical contact etc. In 2004 they got divorced and my dad let my mom have full custody. I lived with her under until I was a bit over 16 then went to live with my dad. Moved out at 18, went back for a bit at 21 and officially moved out at 22. 

Never done an AMA before, so I hope I gave enough info for you guys to want to ask some questions. Please don't be worries to offend or anything, I've got pretty tough skin and am a very open book. I hope maybe my story can help someone else who might have gone through or is going through something similar.",2,1582372050,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f7rk63/i_grew_up_with_a_very_very_mentally_unstable/,IAmA,1

f7qxxw,oinkboinker,My breakup story,"I dated my ex for 1.5 years. I loved her very dearly. We broke up because she thought I wasn’t good for her health. She then jumped into a rebound relationship  less then a month after our breakup. After a month of her being with this guy (let’s call him Gerald) she came back wanting a fresh start with me around December 26, 2019. She stayed friends with Gerald (communicating with eachother daily) while we were trying to get back together. She ended things once again shortly after (a month to be exact) and then went  back to Gerald right after. 

Gerald is the complete opposite of myself, an introvert, very religious man, and doesn’t go out much. 

So I guess my question is, is this another rebound relationship? Is this love? Some of her friends that I’m friends with had no idea this was happening once again. We had broken up and continued talking for 2 months while then decided to roll with Gerald, then around a month after which she then proceeded to inform me she no longer had feelings for him, she’s sorry and tried to get back together with me. We lasted about a month (the whole month of January 2020) and put an end officially on February 5th. Shortly after this “second breakup” she got back together with him. 

We were in the same club tonight and as we were with mutual friends for 2 hours, Gerald came much later. She made out and jumped on him as soon as he arrived right infront of me, she as well proceeded to dance with him provocatively while I was around? To me it seems like another rebound but I’m not sure. I’m completely heart broken once again by this girl. 

I am just trying to understand what is happening this second time with her. I understand an ex is an ex but 7 months later and she is continually on my mind, is crazy to me! I believe she is the love of my life but I don’t want to put myself in another position to be hurt.",2,1582367608,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f7qxxw/my_breakup_story/,IAmA,1

f7lpe8,nofacenoidentity,Dreams*~ please read and help me to get answers,"
So I was taking a nap, honestly it’s really hard for me to make friends, so in this dream I was somewhere. I don’t where but it gave me some New Mexico vibes and the crazy thing is that I’ve never been to New Mexico, anyway so I was walking with this girl, we were trying to get home, there was a lot of homeless people in our way, their houses were made out of plastic bags, it reminded of a teepee;

native Americans houses (I don’t know what this means so if you can tell me please) so instead of being made of wood or animal skins it was plastic bags, then we got home.

There was this guy I’ve never seen him in my life, he was wearing a yellow hoodie, curly black hair and a beautiful smile, anyways, there was this other girl, (she’s actually from work, in real life) the girl that I was walking with in the beginning, this guy with yellow hoodie, there was another guy as well with grey hoodie; I don’t know but for the first time in my life I was happy by having them around me, I felt amazing I don’t even know how to explain it.

I argued with the guy in yellow because he was so positive about life, that everything was pink, there was no danger or bad things. I told him -bad things always happens, a world where everything is pink is not real.

He got mad a me and he left, then I noticed that he was in the roof, looking at me, I started to wash dishes, and I felt that It was a loop cause I was washing spoons but it never ended, when it finally happened I called him to come over and he was so happy when I did call him, (that beautiful smile)

All this friends in my dream started to run with me, I was feeling like a rebel, that feeling when you watch a movie and these rich kids try to run away from their parents and do crazy things? That was the feeling, I turn around and there he was running and smiling to get to me, but I don’t know why but decided to hug this other guy in grey, but I never got to hug him; cause that’s when I woke up.

I hope I see you in my dreams again 🥺.",1,1582336497,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f7lpe8/dreams_please_read_and_help_me_to_get_answers/,IAmA,1

My brother and best friend Brent was diagnosed with a form of Parkinson's disease and was confined to a wheelchair. I decided to build him a custom tank wheelchair. The chair became the perfect icebreaker when meeting people and felt like something fun as opposed to a burden. I decided to make other people custom chairs (including the flame throwing wheelchair!) and eventually things morphed into Wheelchair Labs, an organization that helps people who don't have resources get a regular wheelchair. It does so free of charge and is funded by donations. Here’s a video that I did recently with the channel “Coolest Thing l’ve Ever Made” that shows some of the chairs I made along with some of my other creations”:

After 3 years, I escaped successfully and lived in Shanghai for 2 years. In 2011, I finally arrived in South Korea. I'm currently studying political science at Seoul National University and I'm also a youtuber.

I have also started a Youtube Channel, Jun Story, where I share about the most intimate experiences of North Korean defectors and conduct social experiments. I'm currently collaborating with Mr Kang Chol Hwan, a well known defector and youtuber where we will answer your questions through a series of Youtube videos. 

We hope that you can ask questions and we will answer them through our videos. Thank you so much! 

P.S. Non-political questions preferred :) If you have any fun or silly questions you'd like to know about North Korea, do feel free to drop them in the comments too!

My name is Lubo, and I’m the founder of [Parrity.com](http://parrity.com/), a new learning platform that helps entrepreneurs to learn from other successful entrepreneurs and brands by allowing them to exchange knowledge and experience in an easy way.

( P.S not sure if this is the right place to do so, so please excuse me in advance if that’s the case. I’m new to using Reddit :)

Me and my co-founder Vitally built Parrity because we wanted to create an open space where people eager to learn how to build a business can do so without the boundaries of traditional learning platforms and with a greater sense of community.

Please feel free to ask me anything, we’re currently exploring who are the most interesting authors that people would like to learn from and collecting questions on different subject matter for author AMAs like IP protection, design and pretty much anything else and turning those into useful tutorials.

Ask us anything,"“You can’t discharge student loans in bankruptcy.” I’m sure you’ve heard this before. You may have read it in a publication you trust. Your financial advisor may have recited it as an immutable fact. Or your attorney may have even stated it as a definitive legal conclusion. Everyone, it seems, is in agreement. If you have student loan debt, bankruptcy is not an option. There’s just one problem: This accepted “wisdom” is nothing more than a myth. Contrary to what you’ve been told, student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy. Thousands of people have done it, and with the right legal help, millions more will.   


We are the cofounders of [Reset Button](https://www.resetbutton.com) \- we help connect struggling people with lawyers who can help them.  Here with us today are:  
\* Rob Hunter (CEO): Cofounder of Reset Button, Founder of HigherMe, actually went bankrupt.  
\* Jason Iuliano (COO): Cofounder of Reset Button, Professor of Law at Villanova, leading academic studying student loans in bankruptcy.  
\* Max Morlocke (CTO): Cofounder of Reset Button, Employee #2 @ Reset Button, multiple engineering leadership positions at technology startups.  


We'll do our best to answer any questions about including student loans in bankruptcy.

I just finished my first feature film. After all the YEARS of work, I finally got World Wide Distribution &amp; my movie came out Last Week!","I'm an artist who grew up in Maryland and chased his dream. I ended up spending the last 10 years in Los Angeles writing, directing, producing, and acting. I've survived through all the cliche experiences that most people who move to LA LA Land go through, then end up usually quitting and returning home within 2 years. I stayed, never gave up and somehow found the right connections to put together my first indie comedic feature film. I went to the American Film Market in Nov 2019 to sell it. It was incredibly intimating. I felt very small and had many moments of doubt. There were over 100 vendors from all around the world. After all the blood, sweat and tears I was able to get only 5 meetings out of a 100 companies. Three of them laughed in my face. One of them was polite but said, *""It's not for us.""* But one company took a closer look at me and said, *""We don't usually sell your 'kind of movie' but we're curious and we like you so, we'll watch it and call you if we want it.""* 

  
Two weeks later I got a phone call and they said, *""Yes.""* After the call, I collapsed into a pile of tears because the truth is, I filmed the movie back in 2016 - using a lot of my own money - but the next three years, during post production, I went through incredible personal struggles - money, family, career and sadly my marriage of 7 years came to a collapse. After the dust settled, I took a breath - Thanked God that I finally got picked up for distribution, at the very tail end of 2019, and my movie officially just came out this week in 68 territories World Wide!

Hello, Reddit. My name is [Rich Rotella](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3706252/). When I was a kid, I saw *HOME ALONE* and knew I wanted to be an actor. Now at 35, my first comedic feature film [*MARLO LASKER*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/) just came out on Amazon Prime &amp; Prime Video. It took just over $25k, 6 insane days of filming and 3.5 years in post production; I gained 15 lbs to play the lead character ""Marlo"" while directing &amp; producing as well. I almost DIED from pure exhaustion - mentally, physically, emotionally and definitely financially - to get this crazy movie made but I knew in my heart if I just didn't give up and kept the faith... that I eventually would get my comedy out and into the world. When I was starting this movie, my goal was simple... *""Life is very hard. Let's make the world laugh again!""* Now, I'm here and ready to answer any questions you might have about writing, making, and selling a film in the digital streaming era.

If you're interested in the movie, [*MARLO LASKER*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/) *is a lovable nerd, who goes on a series of adventures to defeat Caleb, the school jock, and win the heart of Susie, the girl of his dreams.*

For whatever reason... high school, college students and ""stoners"" seem to REALLY love the movie... and that's awesome. We're honored to make a goofy movie for that crowd and beyond.

Here's the [trailer on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK8ZecOiUNc) and here's the [IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5968558/). If you like it, you can see the full movie for free on [Amazon Prime / Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Marlo-Lasker-Rich-Rotella/dp/B083VRKR6K/). Check it out, you might be pleasantly surprised. 😊

f701ez,thirsty_for_a_cola,We’re graduate students engaged in a wildcat strike for a Cost of Living Adjustment to counter the absurd housing prices at UC Santa Cruz. Ask us anything!,"**Graduate students (with support of our undergraduate colleagues) at UCSC are on a teaching strike for the second week in a row, in order to fight for cost of living adjustment (COLA) that would lift us out of heavy rent burden.** Many of us pay 50% or more of our income on rent. We have suffered for years with runaway housing costs, meager protections from our labor union contract, and an unsympathetic university administration. Between 2014 and 2018, our contract guaranteed an income increase of 3% per year, but rent increased by 54% over the same time period. Between 2018 and 2019 alone, the cost of housing increased by 15%. UCSC grads have very little power to influence the results of these contract negotiations - during the 2018 contract vote, UCSC grads voted 80% AGAINST the agreement, yet were outvoted by grads at other UCs with larger numbers. 

With few options left, **over 400 graduate teaching assistants (TAs) initiated a wildcat strike last December by withholding fall-quarter grades**. The strike has escalated to the events of these last two weeks.

Since the teaching strike began on Feb 10th

1. **Dozens of police from all over the state were brought in after the first day.** They [circled](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N443HP/history/20200211/1906Z/KMRY/KMRY) surveillance planes over campus. Executive Vice Chancellor Lori Kletzer stated herself that the cost of police presence was $300,000 per day. By the end of this week, UCSC will have spent an estimated $3,000,000 on police escalation, which would be enough to fund a COLA at $1412/month for 177 grad students for an entire year.
2. **Police unnecessarily** [**escalated tensions**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_17xLsLzjQ&amp;feature=youtu.be), brutalized a number of protesters, and arrested seventeen protesters. Several students received various injuries, [and at least one student was treated for a concussion](https://www.kqed.org/news/11801554/striking-uc-santa-cruz-graduate-students-hold-picket-lines-after-police-arrest-17). 
3. **EVC Lori Kletzer and UC President Janet Napolitano issued a** [**threat**](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/02/letter-president-unsanctioned-strike.html) **to remove all striking graduate students from spring TA appointments if fall grades are not submitted by 11:59pm on Friday. This means that dozens of international students will become liable for** [**out-of-state tuition**](https://www.salon.com/2020/02/19/university-of-california-president-napolitano-threatens-to-fire-all-striking-grad-students/) **and** [**face** ***de facto*** **deportation**](https://twitter.com/SpreadtheStrike/status/1230389010532487168)**.**

Amy has had a lifelong passion for spaceflight, researching for a second-grade project on Venus, she was captivated by a cartoon image of two astronauts on the Moon and had to know everything about the Apollo program. She specialized in space history throughout her academic life, culminating in her MA thesis about the little-known Gemini-Rogallo wing.

University life, however, held little allure for Amy, and so she turned her back on academia in favour of popular science writing. She began with her blog, Vintage Space, and soon parlayed that into a career as a science writer with a solid focus on spaceflight history. She’s written for more than a dozen websites, has been an expert interviewee on a half dozen TV shows, and still maintains her blog and YouTube channel, now called The Vintage Space. This is her second book. Her first, Breaking the Chains of Gravity, came out in 2015.

f6p09g,goodenoughtokeep,What to do with a person you’re not sure about anymore,"I am 18 years old and the guy I was previously with is 20. I know you’re already thinking to young to be with anyone, but this guy made me feel like i was the best thing ever and empty. It was long distance and his communication was not so good. Therefore I would go days without texting him to see if he would check on me. But he never did and that hurt me, I always told him too but it was as if he just didn’t care because he was always so “busy”. Yet he doesn’t even have a job his grandparents pay for everything. We stopped talking and when we started talking again I went to go visit him, to me it seemed as if his family liked me but his grandma always told me to not settle for less and I could do better cause he wasn’t dependable. Which I already knew but I didn’t care because I would do anything to make this person happy. Yet while I was there he was texting his ex, I don’t know what about but it hurt me because he told me I wasn’t a rebound and he saw me for who I really was now and he liked that but yet he was texting his ex. I broke up with him because he wasn’t talking to me unless I texted him first but now that we’re not together I never text him, but he texts me every two weeks just laughing at memes or trying to flirt with me. And it’s really sticking to my brain. If I was strong enough to just block him I would but I don’t know why I need this constant validation from him it makes me so sick I cry from the pain in my heart. Sometimes I think to myself was communication really a good reason to stop seeing him or did I just make the biggest mistake of my life. Because when we meet up it’s the best time but when we’re far away it’s the worst. And I know now that when it came to his ex I was just being insecure otherwise he would be with her right now. But now there’s this new girl that he introduced me into when I went to visit him and he said she was a home girl but was she really tho ? Now it seems he’s hanging out with her 24/7 but also trying to make small talk with me. In general I’m so insecure with everything so maybe it is better if he stays with a beautiful girl like her. But then again they could be just friends, It all confuses me and I don’t know what I should do. I wanna overdose and sometimes I just wanna be over him or with him but after 3 years of knowing him i don’t know which one will make it easier for me to stop thinking about him in general.",1,1582180363,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f6p09g/what_to_do_with_a_person_youre_not_sure_about/,IAmA,1

Later we expanded to different skin care products. I had a lot of blackheads and so I started using a vacuum blackhead remover.

What I wanted to do with the business was help others with the products that helped me. 

About a week ago I added a lifestyle section for a product that has helped me a lot. I used to sit behind my PC for 4-5 hours a-day which was not good for my posture.

I Started to walk like a goblin and therefore was searching for a fix.

Found it and I have been selling that in my store as well!

Generally speaking, I can't say I think about it every day. I have chronic pain and historically have used mobility aids - especially during high school. But after years of PT and weightlifting, I'm now proud to say I walk without one! I'd consider myself active with very clear limits on what I can and cannot do. 

I've lived considering myself able-bodied AND considering myself disabled, so I've viewed both sides, even if I WAS disabled and just didn't understand it. 

No question is out of bounds, just don't be unkind :). I'll do my best to answer all the questions posed. I'll be responding for as long as this is an active post.

We are some of the OG members of Linus Tech Tips (Linus Sebastian, Luke Lafreniere, Edzel Yago, and Brandon Lee), one of the biggest PC hardware and consumer tech channels on YouTube, and we are quite excited to be doing our first official Reddit AMA.

The Season 5 Finale of ""Scrapyard Wars"" - our take on a reality show - just launched on our YouTube channel. You can watch all of Season 5 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USr4vZpYkD0&amp;t

We had a ton of fun creating this season (big thanks to PaulsHardware and BitWit for taking part!), and we're hoping to take on even bigger challenges in Season 6, which should take place later this year.

Looking forward to your questions :D we'll be answering as many as we can over the next couple hours.

I decided to do this AMA because of a lot of misconceptions and bad information is taught in public schools.

There is a lot more to this field of history than most of society thinks and there are a TON of inconvenient truths about this area of history.

f5af0w,scorpi0dreamz,Anxiety or medical issue?,"SO, 
This is gonna be long. 
I got a headache about two weeks ago that made me feel like everything was spinning. My head was hurting at the top and back of the head and it was like nothing I’ve ever felt before. I spent days feeling off balance and confused. Mind you, I moved to the Dominican Republic three months prior to this. So after a couple of days I flew back to my hometown (in the states). Got a CT scan, an MRI, had my eyes checked and nothing was wrong. 

This whole time I’ve had pretty bad anxiety. Numbing hands every once in a while, numbed legs. I’ve always had bad anxiety but not like this. So eventually I feel that my vision starts getting worse, like everything is sort of tilting and moving but it wasn’t, extreme nausea, EXTREME anxiety, crying spells and panicking. Feeling like I can’t even watch my 8 month old son. I haven’t been hungry, just constantly looking for a psychologist I can see ASAP. I’ve been having sad dreams and imagining myself in a mental institute. I feel out of touch with reality and my environment, like really detached. I keep calling people crying about this, feeling really desperate and irritated. I feel so out of control.

Now, prior to the headache (in December), I had a severe allergy to a hair dye that made my whole head swell up. Idk if maybe that might have something to do with it but if someone can find a connection, please help. 

I can’t see a doctor today. I already went to the ER and they just gave me migraine meds and anxiety meds that make me feel weird and emotionless. If anyone has any idea what this could be, please help me. I have a baby I need to watch and a husband and pets I want to be present for.",1,1581953785,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f5af0w/anxiety_or_medical_issue/,IAmA,1
f5a4ve,ImperialCollege,I’m a designer working to make hospice care better for seriously ill children and their families. Ask Me Anything,"Hi Reddit! I’m Ivor Williams, Senior Design Associate at the Helix Centre at Imperial College London. 

I lead the end-of-life care projects at the Centre, exploring British hospice care and taking a human-centred design approach to unlock the potential of technology to support seriously ill children and their families.

Hospices provide holistic care for children, young people and adults from the point at which their illness or condition is diagnosed or identified, all the way through to the end of their life, however long that may be. Common misconceptions of children’s hospice care are that they are very sad places and are only for children who have a very short time to live or who are likely to die. On the contrary, hospices are incredibly life-affirming spaces, full of positivity and light, offering support to children with a variety of diseases and conditions, sometimes for long life spans.

I firmly believe design can both improve the quality of life of those living with life-limiting or life-threatening diseases and their families, as well as play a role in shifting perceptions of hospice care.

A bit of background

Research and innovation in children’s hospice care are underdeveloped, largely because the diseases and conditions which require hospice care are often very rare, and so the evidence base is lacking. 

Breakthroughs in medical treatments in recent decades mean children are living longer with difficult conditions, which is a great thing. However, this also means the complexity and needs of children requiring hospice care are growing. We need new processes to respond to those needs, and for their families.

About my work

I work at the Helix Centre – an innovation lab working at the heart of healthcare – which is an integral part of the Institute of Global Health Innovation. Along with colleagues who work in health policy and design, we are trying to unlock the potential of technology to create products, services and experiences in hospice care, such as peer support programmes, advance care planning, memory-making and legacy. I work with other designers, technologists, academics, children and families to see what exists and then use design methods and processes (such as prototyping and workshops) to come up with creative solutions to those needs.",129,1581952610,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f5a4ve/im_a_designer_working_to_make_hospice_care_better/,IAmA,1

My name is Lubo, and I’m the founder of [Parrity.com](http://parrity.com/), a new learning platform that helps entrepreneurs to learn from other successful entrepreneurs and brands by allowing them to exchange knowledge and experience in an easy way.

I’m making this topic by the request of one of our [Telegram community](https://t.me/parritycommunity) members (JS) and in hopes to connect with Redditors that might find useful what we built. ( P.S not sure if this is the right place to do so, so please excuse me in advance if that’s the case. I’m new to using Reddit :)

Me and my co-founder Vitally built Parrity because we wanted to create an open space where people eager to learn how to build a business can do so without the boundaries of traditional learning platforms and with a greater sense of community.

Please feel free to ask me anything, we’re currently exploring who are the most interesting authors that people would like to learn from and collecting questions on different subject matter for author AMAs like IP protection, design and pretty much anything else and turning those into useful tutorials.

f56u3k,mabolle,IamA biologist who just defended my PhD thesis on butterfly life cycles and local climate. Ask me anything!,"Hullo, I'm Olle, I'm a biologist/ecologist/entomologist and science communicator, currently working at the Department of Zoology, Stockholm University, Sweden. Last week I defended my PhD thesis, which you can find [here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1377626&amp;dswid=-1480), including a .pdf link to the thesis summary.

Briefly, my work for the past five years has focused on the ways in which insects tune their life cycles to the local climate, and the genetic mechanisms that make such adaptation possible. We've been using the speckled wood butterfly as a model system, a widespread species that varies in its life cycle across Europe. In places with long warm seasons it produces several generations per year; where the season is short, it only produces one generation per year. Many insects show this kind of variation, and when they're economically important (like pest insects), it can make a big difference! Results from our lab have connected the variation in life cycles with variation in circadian clock genes, which may be helping the butterflies tell what time of year it is by interpreting the duration of daylight.

My thesis consists of four papers, two of which have been published elsewhere, [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.2550) and [here](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2435.13525).

f53ecc,Amethyst_Playz,I am a teenage girl who was minipulated by an older person to do “inappropriate things” with them. Ask me anything about it.,"Around November of 2018 I was bored and looked up MLP Casting Calls because I wanted to be part of an audio drama, I decided to audition for one, and was casted as a child of one of the main characters (Pinkie Pie). Soon I began talking to the crew and became very close with the host, and we told stuff about our personal life. 
Soon I was a script writer, and character designer because according to them “I was their only friend” 
First she would tell me small things like she was forced to go to a school she didnt want to
To an abusive boyfriend
And then admitted they had a crush on me.
I told her I’m straight, and made her situation much worse.
She would tell stories of her being bullied, and hit, neglected, r*ped, ect. Because it was happening so slow I belived her. 
Soon they made me belive I was bisexual, and told me what I felt towards them was love, and I should date them, I fell for it and things only got worse. They would do this roplay thing and try to do disgusting things with me, started as harmless kissing to straight up s3x, and I was uncomfortable with all of it, but they had me belive it was my idea. They got me to send picture of myself in bathing suits, because they knew I wasnt farth enough to send straight up nudes cause I made that clear early on that if someone asked me I would cut them off, they tried to tell me what I could and couldn’t do and I went with it. Eventually my mom found out, and got them out of my life but I went back through my XBox and I couldnt talk as often, after long peirods of time I reliesed how toxic it was and cut them off completely deleting all my social media, and when I got my phone back blocked them from my contacts. This happened in July of 2019. And the bad minipulation started in April of 2019. 
And go ahead blame me all you want cause I know I could’ve stopped it and I wanted to but they threatened to kill themselves and I couldnt be responcsible for someone’s death. Th

Now my depression has gotten worse, I get panic attacks (which my friend who has PTSD and gets similar reactions to certain things say I might have PTSD) and I have trust issues especially online.

I'm a lifelong North Dakotan. I love this state and this country. I'm running for the Democratic-NPL party's endorsement for the U.S. House against incumbent GOP congressman Kelly Armstrong.

At this time, I am the only Dem-NPL candidate in the race. The party has faced challenging times after losing Dem-NPL senator Heitkamp in the 2018 cycle. The party will endorse its nominee at the state convention the weekend of March 21st.

I believe strongly that progressive, populist policies that put working people top of mind gives us the best chance to win in North Dakota. While beet red in current representation, North Dakotans have consistently voted purple on a variety of issues on the ballot.

This campaign is powered by people, no corporate PACs. **Please** consider chipping in a small donation. We need to start printing materials and paying fees for the upcoming state convention. 

There has not been a progressive like me on the statewide ballot in North Dakota in many years. I'm excited to bring these policies forward. Ask me anything!

I saw a blog owned by Jay Z where he said 'it's free of charge for those in America to become a member of the brotherhood' so he imputed the direct contact of the Temple Messenger together with the only assigned agent of the brotherhood USA agent Brother James Watt. I contacted agent Brother James Watt on his officials +1(601)228-2602 and he linked me up with the Temple Messenger. So the temple messenger forwarded my application to the Grand Master and I was lucky to be accepted. I was linked to my Initiation God Father (IGF) who made me observed the ten steps of the initiation and I was finally inducted on the 20th night. Today I am proud to say I am a very wealthy, famous and highly protected man. My generation's future have been settled, I am extremely wealthy today is the help of Illuminati. Please if you want to be extremely rich, famous, protected and want a settled generation, or you want to end well in life because you are already rich, and want to protect your investment and future.

At the University of Florida, I direct the [Brain, Language, and Bilingualism (BLAB) Lab](https://blab.lin.ufl.edu/) with Dr. Edith Kaan. Together we investigate topics such as bilingual language processing in the brain, including how bilingual speaker switch between two languages, and what are the brain consequences of when we learn a second language later in life. During my Flash Talk at the 2020 AAAS Meeting, I will discuss the idea that that bilingualism is worth considering as a key part of human health. Learning multiculturalism and multilingualism have been shown to improve social skills and decrease isolation, yet our aging society lacks in such areas.

I'm a bioengineer and computer scientist. I started Prime Roots out of the UC Berkeley Alternative Meat Lab with my co-founder who is a culinologist and microbiologist.  
    
 We make meatless bacon that acts, smells, and tastes like bacon from an animal. Our technology is made with our koji based protein which is a traditional Japanese fungi (so in between plant-based and lab grown). Our protein is a whole food source of protein since we grow the mycelium and use it whole (think of it like roots of mushrooms).   
   
 Our investors were early investors in Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods and we're the only other alternative meat company they've backed. We know there are lots of great questions about plant-based meats and alternative proteins in general so please ask away!

f3k6ba,floruide,"I am a school shooting survivor from Parkland, FL here to give a student perspective and update, AMA","On February 14th, 2018, an ex-student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida entered a building (of 900 students with only 2 sets of double doors) with an AR-15 and killed 17 and injured another 17 students, educators, and faculty. This student had a long disciplinary history and was [reported to the FBI and police](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7vej/all-the-times-nikolas-cruz-was-reported-to-authorities-before-the-florida-shooting) multiple times as a potential school shooter.

Since then,

* The school has implemented security checkpoints and requires students to wear ID at all times.
* Less than half of the students currently at MSD were students at the time of the shooting. None of the students will have been present at the shooting as of June 2021.
* The entire school administration, including principal, has been replaced. Superintendent Robert Runcie's diversion programs kept the shooter in school without a criminal history, but he avoided removal with loyal board members and [by playing the race card.](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-broward-schools-pack-meeting-runcie-supporters-20190226-story.html)
* We perform code red drills (hide from shooter) at least once per month.
* 2 survivors committed suicide.
* The 1200 building is surrounded by a tall fence. The windows are covered with construction paper, the [doors bolted](http://i.imgur.com/yoYFluP.jpg), but [lights can still be seen turned on at night.](https://i.imgur.com/ujzbDrz.jpg)
* A new building to replace the 1200 building is [under construction.](http://i.imgur.com/VNpc0lf.jpg)
* [Little to no progress has been made](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article238516103.html) on the death penalty case of the shooter whose trial has been postponed. The average number of years between offense and execution in Florida is 16.60 years.
* A significant portion of students experience PTSD or paranoia when sirens or gunshot-like noises occur.
* Some security staffers treat students with extreme disrespect, causing students to resent them.
* Prevention measures, including national laws and local school policies, have not been significantly expanded.
* Security measures are ineffective and do not address the issues that made the 2018 shooting possible.
* Despite security changes, a nearly identical shooting could still occur--perhaps even worse, as a shooter would likely take advantage of vulnerabilities in the code red protocol.

I do not like being mere feet within the 1200 building every day at school. I hate the new culture at the school. I hate the PTSD and paranoia that too many of us suffer from too frequently. I went through periods when I could not stop thinking about the shooting. It kept me up at night and made its way into my dreams. Lately, I have been fine, but this has been/will be a hard week for all of us. I was lucky to avoid death on that day. I still wish every day that it didn't happen. I also wish that it never happens to anyone else.

We’re Robert Ferl, PhD, and Anna-Lisa Paul, PhD, and we lead the UF Space Plants laboratory to try to understand extraterrestrial plant life.

Since 1999, we have launched and analyzed a dozen orbital spaceflight experiments to explore the effects of the spaceflight gene expression. Our experimental heritage lies in the study of gene expression in response to environmental change, leading now toward an understanding of the new environments of spaceflight and extraterrestrial habitats.

While we are both dedicated lab geeks, we also enjoy and advocate for the field experiential side of science – we’ve flown with our experiments on parabolic, or reduced-gravity, flights and other research aircraft. We have also personally worked in planetary exploration analogs in Antarctica (Neumayer III) and in the high Canadian Arctic (the Haughton Mars Project).

In 2015, we were the co-recipients of NASA’s Award for Most Compelling Science on the International Space Station. Our current research is focused on evaluating the epigenomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment and using the new generation of suborbital launch vehicles to explore the transitions to and from space.

f3gcy5,mrgirl,I was (quite publicly) arrested in college for comments about the Virginia Tech shooting,"In a political discussion class, the day after the shooting, our professor asked us to discuss and try to understand the Virginia Tech shooting.

After hearing the usual ""thoughts and prayers"" from my classmates, I suggested we'd be better served by empathizing with the shooter, his anger and isolation, and use that as a framework for coming up with changes we can make to our education system that might actually help prevent shootings in the future.

I said that we've all had violent thoughts, and if we pretend we haven't, we're lying. We live in a violent society (the U.S.) and humans are violent animals. Instead of pretending that isn't the case, we should figure out why that violence is being directed toward institutions like schools, especially huge crappy schools that dehumanize their students.

Rather than engage me in an intellectual way, the teacher announced that I had raised the specter of the possibility that I was going to murder all my classmates on Thursday. I said this was not going to happen...

But because of my history of writing provocative satire (not about killing people), the chair of the department (not present in the class) called the police and told them that I'd threatened to kill everyone.

I spent the night in jail and was barred from campus for 10 weeks, only to be let back in after a psychological evaluation. I was charged with the misdemeanor of ""Interference of faculty, staff, or students of an educational institution,"" which was punishable by up to 18 months in jail.

Newspapers and TV stations reported that I said I was angry enough to kill, which I did not and would not say. If you've never been misquoted in the news, I can tell you it's a singularly unpleasant experience.

Two ACLU lawyers saw me on CNN while I was in jail and came to bail me out (I had no idea who they were or what was happening). After several months of back and forth with the school and the DA, the school reversed my suspension retroactively and the DA dropped the charges. Of course by then I'd already been completely terrified and humiliated, but at least I didn't spend 18 months in jail.

This is only the second time I have spoken publicly about the whole affair. I also made a [video](https://youtu.be/4hNrVvqYHtE) about it including audio recordings of my and the witness's police interviews.

According to [federal data](https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/201708241000), each year between 2009 and 2014, an average of almost 9 million children younger than 17 lived in households with at least one parent who has a substance use disorder. Consider that millions more don’t live with that parent due to separation, divorce, incarceration, removal from their home, or their loved one’s death. Since this disease tends to run in families, supporting these kids is critical.

f3cihw,bloomberglaw,I’m a tax attorney tackling your tough tax questions. AMA about tax!,"I write about tax and tax policy. My work appears on my site, Taxgirl, and I have a weekly column with Bloomberg Tax. I'm also a tax attorney where I help clients navigate tricky tax issues, including tax compliance and controversy matters like tax delinquencies, offers in compromise, and audits. I've found that taxpayers often get into trouble because it can be challenging to keep up with rules that keep changing and becoming more complicated. When Form 1040 was introduced in 1913, the instructions took up just one page, the 2019 instructions take up 174 pages, not including separate schedules like those for itemized deductions, capital gains, and small businesses.

With tax season in full swing, I want to know how I can help you figure it out. Do you have questions about choosing a filing status? What can you deduct as a freelancer? Why didn't you receive your entire tax refund? I'll tackle your tax questions so that you're ready to file before Tax Day, April 15.

Outside of Reddit, you can find me on Twitter @taxgirl.

f3ayho,ufexplore,"We are University of Florida research scientists Rob Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul working to feed Martians! For more than 20 years, we’ve been studying how to grow plants in space to enable explorations. AMA!","Hi, Reddit! We’re Robert Ferl, PhD, and Anna-Lisa Paul, PhD, and we lead the UF Space Plants laboratory to try to understand extraterrestrial plant life.

Since 1999, we have launched and analyzed a dozen orbital spaceflight experiments to explore the effects of the spaceflight gene expression. Our experimental heritage lies in the study of gene expression in response to environmental change, leading now toward an understanding of the new environments of spaceflight and extraterrestrial habitats.

While we are both dedicated lab geeks, we also enjoy and advocate for the field experiential side of science – we’ve flown with our experiments on parabolic, or reduced-gravity, flights and other research aircraft. We have also personally worked in planetary exploration analogs in Antarctica (Neumayer III) and in the high Canadian Arctic (the Haughton Mars Project).

In 2015, we were the co-recipients of NASA’s Award for Most Compelling Science on the International Space Station. Our current research is focused on evaluating the epigenomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment and using the new generation of suborbital launch vehicles to explore the transitions to and from space.

5 years ago, I did a Q&amp;A on Reddit about the living conditions in North Korea. In 2020, I've decided to do the same. 

Since escaping North Korea, I have become a journalist, author, and human rights activist. I am the founder of the North Korea Strategy Center, an NGO whose goal is to advocate for free media and press in North Korea.

I'm looking forward to answering questions about my latest feature investigation, [The Playbook for Poisoning the Earth](https://theintercept.com/2020/01/18/bees-insecticides-pesticides-neonicotinoids-bayer-monsanto-syngenta/), a comprehensive look at neonics, one of the main pesticides fueling the mass-die off of a range of insect life. Lobbying documents and emails reveal a vast strategy by the pesticide industry to influence academics, beekeepers, and regulators, and to divert attention away from the potential harm caused by pesticides.

Wildly, extraordinarily ambitious. The company hasn’t provided a timeline for when these goals will be achieved. What’s certain, though, is that it will require gargantuan amounts of recycling of materials from old products, for reuse in new Apple products.

f1uuex,Canniloq,I am Dan Estoque - Inventor and Entrepreneur. AMA,"I'm Dan Estoque and have spent the last 25 years designing and bringing a wide range of products to market. I'm a mechanical engineer by training, am listed on 5 patents, and have worked on dozens of products that went to market - from complex medical systems to simple products having only a single part. On some of these products I was part of team composed of dozens of other designers, but on most products I was the sole designer.

In the early part of my career I worked for large companies that specialized in narrow fields. But being a minority in the late 90's corporate culture, my growth was stifled, so I moved to doing design consulting for companies, inventors and entrepreneurs. The types of products were much broader, and working as a consultant to help people and small companies bring their ideas to market gave me valuable insight into this process.

Most people who start down the road don't have a good idea about what it takes to bring a physical product to market. I would guess that only about 20% of the products that I completed ever made it to market. Once you get a working prototype you're only 1/2 way there.

Then after helping numerous other's to convert their napkin sketches into businesses, I decided to do it for myself. 

In 2016 I started thinking about products to build a manufacturing company around. The product had to be:

· Within my own technical and financial capabilities to develop and launch

· Something I could be interested and passionate about

· Serve the greater good

· Have a good chance of being successful 

We have sold thousands of durable, ruggedized, child-resistant containers to mostly cannabis users, and now we are trying to introduce and champion the practice of using [Ecofriendly, Reusable, Child-Resistant Containers](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ecofriendly-reusable-child-resistant-containers#/) to reduce single use plastic waste.

It's interesting - you go through life, picking up little, seemingly unrelated bits of wisdom, and then one day all the stars align and you see that they were all supposed to fit together.

f1rgz3,Kirk_Johnson1,"I'm Kirk Johnson, paleontologist and Sant Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. AMA!","I’m Dr. Kirk Johnson, the Sant Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Here, I oversee the nation’s natural history collection: more than 146 million specimens and artifacts that together comprise the largest collection of its kind in the world. Each year, the museum hosts more than 5 million visitors and its scientists publish more than 800 scientific research papers and name more than 300 new species. 

On June 8, 2019, we opened The *David H. Koch Hall of Fossils-Deep Time*, a 31,000 square-foot exhibition that interprets the history of life on Earth and its relevance to the future of humanity. The exhibit is packed with real fossils and skeletons including a *Tyrannosaurus rex* from Montana, an elephant-sized *Eremotherium*Ground Sloth from Panama, a *Diplodocus* from Utah, a *Stegosaurus* from Colorado, a 50-million-year-old palm frond from Alaska and hundreds more. The museum also houses a 52-foot-long model of the extinct *Carcharocles megalodon* shark.

Before my arrival to the Smithsonian in 2012, I worked as a paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science where I led expeditions in 18 states and 11 countries. My research focuses on fossil plants and the extinction of the dinosaurs, and has taken me from the polar regions to the equatorial rainforests. In 2011, I led an ice age excavation near Snowmass Village in Colorado that recovered parts of more than 50 mastodon skeletons. 

I’m known for my scientific articles, popular books, museum exhibitions, documentaries, and collaborations with artists. My recent documentaries include *Ice Age Death Trap* (2012), *Making North America* (2015), *The Great Yellowstone Thaw* (2017), and *The Day the Dinosaurs Died* (2017). My current show, [NOVA’S Polar Extremes](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/polar-extremes/)*, which premiered on PBS on Feb. 5,* uses the fossil record from the Arctic and the Antarctic to show that the polar regions were ice-free and forested for much of Earth’s history. 

My recent book, *Cruisin’ the Fossil Coastline*, *The Travels of an Artist and a Scientist along the Shores of the Prehistoric Pacific* (2018) explores the deep history of the West Coast from California to Alaska. And my upcoming book, *Trees are made of Gas, The Story of Carbon and Climate*, will be published this fall.

I’m originally from Bellevue, Washington and have a bachelor’s degree from Amherst College, a master’s from the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate in geology and paleobotany from Yale. Ask me anything!

f1cme7,ComedianDavidFowles,"I talked a man out of murdering me while he was doing it, then rang myself an ambulance.","Basically, a recently-acquired housemate came to my bedroom at about 3am, after an argument, and injured me at least 25 times with a kitchen knife and broke my neck. I talked to him about the effects this would have on his life, from the moment he entered the room, and of the things he had coming up, and something got through, and he stopped, and tried to help me not to die. It was very close, but I did not die. 

I think I’m going to be moved to rehabilitation soon after two weeks in the trauma ward. There are wounds on my arms, legs, chest, neck and back and a teensy one on my head. I had twenty staples and over seventy sutures, an arm splint and a neck brace I’ll be in for four more weeks. My right arm is partially paralysed but may improve? Can use my hand and bicep but shoulder won’t yet move.

I posted about it on Facebook to my comedy friends and a journalist contacted me and wrote this article:

https://10daily.com.au/news/a200205pdcsb/i-talked-someone-out-of-killing-me-then-rang-myself-an-ambulance-20200206?fbclid=IwAR2bIjr0e5hVLf_kb30yDBkmnYxXPV4sDXJBJ9_4HJA_AjLDAjpkb8Z8ppo

If people have questions I’ll answer as I can. I intend to talk and write about what happened so seeing what people ask may help? My dominant / writing arm is very damaged though so posts may be far between. There’s also legal considerations due to upcoming trial, so answers may not satisfy. The perp went quietly and is in custody. My cat was found and is in safe care.

f18v5f,theworldsnotmacaroni,"I'm a 23 year old man who is physically incapable of having sex, AMA","When I was a senior in high school, I learned through a failed sexual encounter with my girlfriend at the time that my penis doesnt function normally. I was raised in a very religious household so I had never attempted masturbation before but looking back, I always felt like something was wrong. Without going in to too much detail, my penis gets literally rock-hard and stiff to the point where it hurts to try to pump at all. My erections are more pain than pleasure. I've managed to get to orgasm before but I dont feel anything until the end and even then, it isnt without pain or discomfort.

This post was originally super long but I cut it down. That would defeat the purpose of an AMA. Basically, this had ruined me emotionally due to failed toxic relationships and several doctors telling me theres nothing wrong. None of the urologists I've seen had any idea what could be wrong with me so ive lost hope. Ive convinced myself that no one will ever love me again and havent dated in years. I feel like I'm living a lie because I've told literally no one about this due to overwhelming shame. Ask me about any of it.

f0q10h,ndrw010,"I am Andrew Milne, winner of a Nobel Prize in Physics and oppressed/hunted by the British and Irish Governments to steal my secrets, including a design patent for an engine (which is here: 146.90.48.142). Ask me Anything","In 2015 I became known to the intelligence agencies in the world for two main things - a design patent for a hyper efficient engine (nearly 100%) which you can download here: [Patent Download](https://146.90.48.142) and also a new theory in physics which represents a complete rewrite of relativity. This theory, the original source of the idea electrons are rings of light, protons figures-of-eight and neutron 4leaf clover in shape, has been proven in a number of ways.

Since this time, I have had my bank accounts stolen, all my belongings and I was thrown out on the street in the middle of the night by fake policemen. All intent on defaming my name and family. Since then I have seen women I know from the past being possessed physically abused by men in front of me, in an attempt to silence me and make me go away. This is all run by MI5, who often impersonate police and the intelligence services of the UK, which I can clearly state is the major global terrorist run state. I have not been able to find any help in any arm of government and currently have daily interactions on the street which are intended again to defame - to portray my personality as someone no-one should talk to.

The have asked on a number of occasions for details of the engine design which they would need to build it, in an attempt to terrorize me into giving them the secrets they need to steal my ideas.

The engine is worth in excess of trillions of pounds over decades because of it's increased efficiency.

I am here at my family home, continually oppressed each day with comments from passers by, intended to mislead me into thinking all sorts of things - like how my wife might come to see me and how they might pay me for the idea. The intention is that I give away enough details for them to steal the engine idea and not pay royalties.

Because of the value of the engine, i have stipulated that the proceeds for the engine should be spent on building everyone on earth a free home to the highest of technological standards. One of the reasons the British state is terrorising me is because of this idea. Doing it my way with this money means they don't make billions from stealing government money in housebuilding programmes.

It means that fully, this state is anti-democratic (obvious from the brexit narrative!) and terrorist run, which means pushing people to the street who might expose their stealing activities.

I have been researching this for 4 years now, as my wife was held away from me and other females from my life in a Boko-Haram style attack against me, and yes that does mean British MI5 raping my women from my life. Yes, I repeat, British MI5 engaged in rape tactics against a man with fortunes to offer in physics and engineering, in an attempt to steal.",81,1581158513,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f0q10h/i_am_andrew_milne_winner_of_a_nobel_prize_in/,IAmA,1

f0gtbz,uchealthorg,"I’m Cassandra Witt, a professional bodybuilder who suffered a traumatic brain injury in November 2017 when I slipped on my hardwood floor in a pair of fuzzy socks. Ask me anything.","That’s right, I’ve been a hardcore athlete since I was a kid and have done some pretty extreme things in my life, but what nearly took me out was falling while putting on pajamas in my bedroom. I was gearing up to compete in my first bodybuilding competition at the time, but I cracked my head so hard that I was suddenly sidelined with life-threatening injuries including a hairline skull fracture, a brain bleed and a blood clot in the back of my head known as a sinus thrombosis. My injuries demanded several months of daily injections of blood thinners, so strenuous activity was a no-go because it could cause another brain bleed.
 
I built up my strength enough to get back to a six-days-a-week workout routine within six weeks of a clear MRI in February 2018. Four months later, I was up on the competition stage, placing second in two of my three events.

f0d2ko,TSpiggle,Sexual Harassment and the Academy Awards: Employment Attorney Tom Spiggle is here to answer questions on harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Ask Me Anything!,"I am employment attorney Tom Spiggle of [The Spiggle Law Firm](https://www.spigglelaw.com/). Employees now spend most of their days sitting in the office rather than at home. They should view the office as a safe place and shouldn’t have to worry about workplace misconduct, and certainly shouldn’t have to endure harassment and discrimination. As the 92nd Academy Awards are quickly approaching, the shadow of 2017 and the #MeToo movement continues to hang over the world of Hollywood and many people that work in the film industry. I believe the topic of workplace harassment and discrimination needs to be discussed so that we can prevent it from happening in a place where employees are supposed to feel safe. 

Here is my [proof](https://www.facebook.com/spigglelaw/photos/a.824257430938586/2955536647810643/?type=3&amp;theater) , a [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-dugan-sues-recording-academy-940882/)[ article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/grammys-dugan-sues-recording-academy-940882/) on my topic, and my[ employment blog](https://www.spigglelaw.com/employment-blog/).

I’ve been writing through a Florida lens since 2015, so most of my work centers on the Gators and Seminoles. But I was born and raised in Big Ten Country (Indiana) and graduated from Northwestern, plus I used to cover the Big 12 at the Tulsa World. That means I can appreciate Hail to the Victors and Boomer Sooner just as much as Florida State’s war chant.

I also have the privilege of voting for the Heisman and in the AP Top 25 poll. I’m sure you’ve agreed with all of my choices.

I’m not afraid to dig into off-field scandals, like the Jameis Winston case at FSU or credit card fraud at Florida. But I prefer to focus on the field. I love college football more than everything but my wife, my dog and my son (who just became a threenager, God help me). Next on the list: running, Star Wars and The Bachelor.

So let’s chat. Ask me anything about college football, journalism or surviving a year and a half in Florida in a car with a busted A/C.

So I was seven, I was at school and we was going to church, I don't know why we go there but the school always go there, including going to summer break. So it was close to summer break and we we're going to the church. Nothing weird, but I forgot to drink water for a while. We were practising singing in church before the summer break, so we wouldn't have a cringe attack or something. 

We we're going back to the lunch and that's when the effects kicked in. I couldn't resist saying ""water"" (we had to wait a bit extra because we came early) and when they opened it was too late. I was running and fainting at the same time, It started fading black. I took a seat very fast. And almost died there, I didn't feel anything it was just... It was like you're about to sleep but something was wrong. I was really tired. They got me a glass of water and I drank a little. Then it started to fade back into reality. I was taken to the doctor and they took tests on me and I was fine. 

I do not have any proof, but maybe it might be on the Swedish news.

f079mq,HumbleBob2,IAmA musician/comedian/writer who taught himself how to channel the unconscious mind and I'm keen on sharing what I know! AMA,"Hey everyone!

I go by Humble Bob on social media, my musician's alias is Duckfoot, but my real name is Shaun Russell.

After having a majorly traumatic episode in 2017, I discovered, a few months after recovering, that I could now channel lyrics among other things.

Here's a link to my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-124844287) page. I am working on releasing my debut album as Duckfoot atm with the working title 'Insanity Is Not What It Seems', the demo version being on my SoundCloud if you wanna check it out.

I've also been Livestreaming a show about channeling for about a year now. Not many have stumbled across it but I truly think there's some interesting stuff for just about anyone in every episode. Here's a link to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/boojiboy1986) profile.

I've got at least a dozen screenplays I'm working on and I'm shooting soon something for a TV show I'm developing.

If you would like to see my explanation of channeling, check out the post that I made on the r/channeling subreddit.

Even I don't know what channeling really is, so I'm sure you must have questions, so please ask away.

In an effort to continue educating the public about the cool and mysterious world of commercial aviation, I ran an different [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/eyt2jh/im_a_commercial_airline_pilot_ama/) that yielded some interesting questions that I enjoyed answering (to the best of my ability). It was fun so I figured I'd see if there were any more questions out there that I can help with.  


Trying this again with the verification I missed last time. Short bio, I've been flying since 2004, have two aviation degrees, certified in helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, propeller planes and jets, and have really been enjoying this airline gig for a little over the last two years.

Automation: My job is unique. Instead of getting a certificate or an internship, i carved it out through time &amp; referrals. People come to me when they own a business and are spending a lot of time on 'cyber chores' and i build unique software that does it for them. This lets them focus on what they do best &amp; regain their work life balance

O.C.D: I have Pure O.C.D. Most people with Pure O.C.D spend years or decades without realizing they have Pure O because they are unfamiliar with it. O.C.D is often thought of as a disorder that causes hyper-organization or a fear of germs but it is so much more than that. Matter of fact, the WHO considers OCD to be one of the top ten most debilitating illnesses in the world [https://www.intrusivethoughts.org/blog/pure-o-an-exploration-into-a-lesser-known-form-of-ocd/](https://www.intrusivethoughts.org/blog/pure-o-an-exploration-into-a-lesser-known-form-of-ocd/)

India &amp; Poverty: I grew up in a slum. A long time ago I lost my grandmother because we couldn't pay $500 for her surgery. Yes, $500, i didn't forget a zero. I work with various NGOs that help fight corruption and help the poor exercise their rights, particularly the Right to Information Act which is often used to combat corruption in India. Ask me about the fight at ground level and particularly how we are using software to fight the system!

I had a pile of paperwork to sort through, a backlog of work to get done and more than a few bills to pay. I was asked to stop everything and urgently draw a cute greeting card for a friend (as a favour... of course) and before I knew it I had drawn an angry duckling saying QUACK F***ING QUACK. It made me laugh out loud and I shared it online.

It quickly became apparent that it was making a few other people smile too (You probably met [Grumpy Pig, Grumpy Sloth or Grumpy Bear](https://www.reddit.com/user/payitforwards/submitted/?sort=top) here on Reddit), and so a promise was made. No matter what else life would bring in 2020, I would set aside enough time each day to draw and post a daily grumpy animal. At the end of the year, I would have 366 grumpy animals to put in a hardback coffee table book and a smile on my face. Tomorrow will be day 30.

Here’s a little about what I have been up to: Because of ZOOM, I pursued a career in entertainment, initially in front of the camera but mainly working behind the scenes in television and film production. I studied TV and film at Emerson College then spent 10  years working on a variety of productions including, A Place of Our Own / Los Niños en su Casa (PBS), FETCH! With Ruff Ruffman (PBS), Hall Pass (New Line), The Three Stooges Movie (Fox), and many others. In 2016, I produced my first feature film, Annabelle Hooper and the Ghosts of Nantucket (Netflix). In addition to my production experience, I also worked in Visual Effects at 20th Century Fox on feature films, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Prometheus, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters, and many others. I also served as a development/production Executive and Producer for The Three Stooges company, C3 Entertainment, where I developed new TV and film content based on The Three Stooges and other established properties. I’m now back where it all started, WGBH Boston, working in production finance, where I oversee and manage the funding to many of WGBH’s programs. But enough about me, let’s hear from you!

eym5sv,urmumsyadad,IAmA meme kid who successfully threw a Fyre Festival,"Hi Reddit,

*I'll try and keep this introduction short, since there's a lot of moving parts to this story.*

My name is Kai, but I'm probably better known as ""urmumsyadad"" for my old comedy skits which were posted on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/urmumsyadad/) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/urmumsyadad/) *(they're all pretty shit but some people found them amusing*). For a good year of my life I was a household name in Australia (*for teenagers at least*).

My comedy career peaked in 2017 when ABC TV funded three episodes of a series I wrote and starred in [Titled ""WOES""](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/fresh-blood-woes). I studied Mining Engineer and had no education or prior experience in Film and TV, so this was an achievement for me. I went from making memes to TV in under a year. Unfortunately, I was unable to secure further funding and so decided to **move to Bali and throw a music festival**, **with absolutely zero experience or knowledge in events.**

My festival [""Gypsy Land""](https://www.gypsy.land) launched in 2018 with a [single Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgDQ8ivHrmH/), it was not the response I was hoping for and many people criticized it as the next **Fyre Festival**. This was the first realization that this could be a massive failure on par with other ""influencer"" events such as [TanaCon](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17500590/tanacon-disaster-fyre-fest-tana-mongeau-youtuber).

My level of commitment through social media stunts gained attention from various media outlets. Here's some shit I did

* [Prank called one of Australia's largest radio stations to advertise my event for free](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu5hPf1FKUK/)
* [""Tattooed"" my festival brand on my neck](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bke36rtBq1h/)
* [Used Charlie Sheen to call out a date clash with another event](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkABit1BvkT/)
* [Got other influencers to drive bulldozers](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhlCYRhhowo/)
* [pretended to be an EDM DJ](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bk9ZYUPB2qZ/)

Anyway, the event was a **huge success,** with around 3,500 people attending - we've since been able to grow the company and have expectations for around 10,000 people this year for our 3rd year anniversary. [Here's last years after movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh1e_JzmZ94)

My friend and I are PhDc's in neuroscience and recently created a new Neuroscience-based podcast ft. First-hand perspectives from the authors themselves! This episode explores a recent article on how it's possible to study human depression using rats and mice! Would love your feedback!

Interested in cutting-edge neuroscience research? Or cutting through the ribbons of
public-accessibility for research articles?
Introducing the First-Person Science Podcast: The 1st and only podcast dedicated to
in-depth exploration of neuroscience research articles with first-hand perspectives and narratives from the authors themselves.
FPS introduces a new way to discover and engage with neuroscience research. We aim
to break-down barriers to science communication by explaining jargon and complicated concepts in entertaining and succinct ways in a ‘journal club’ style to encourage collaboration and discussion between scientists and the public, alike.

In each episode, a scientist joins the show to speak about their recent ‘first-author’
manuscript. We walk viewers through each figure “1 bar graph at a time” using
panel-to-panel summaries with video and visual illustrations to aid understanding of
complex topics. View all figures and aspects of the research articles on our YT channel:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIStqpo1YZRTFKn5m1J0iQ

Listeners can expect to learn cool facts and get a general background for everything
related to the episode's journal article through a visually immersive ‘journal club’
approach to the podcast, Ft. narratives and first-person perspectives from the
authors/scientists themselves. It's a fine line to manage, but we're doing our best! And
the more feedback from people from all levels of background/understanding, the better!

eyjlrr,flyingperson23,IAmA student in the top 1% of intelligence. AMA!,"Pretty much what the title says. I'm currently a freshman at a top Louisiana school, can't disclose more than that. In 7th grade, I took the ACT through the Duke TIP program and scored a 31 ([https://imgur.com/gallery/hh3UpP0](https://imgur.com/gallery/hh3UpP0)). This year I took the PSAT, and scored a 1420 ([https://imgur.com/gallery/hmiFG6s](https://imgur.com/gallery/hmiFG6s)).

About me: I'm a stereotypical nerd, I love building and programming computers (Arch linux gang), I'm very socially awkward, I have depression and anxiety. I also highly suspect I have (very) mild Asperger's, which has been confirmed by my psychiatrist, although not officially diagnosed. I don't like bragging at all, so I attribute my intelligence, lack of social skills, and strange (and very overactive) empathy to this.

I'm in Precalculus (honors), AP Human geography, and all my other classes are honors (except PE). I find all my classes to be laughably easy, and love to read and play modded minecraft.

I'm the kind of kid that never studies for tests and always gets good grades. I've seen plenty of memes about that kind of kid so I figured it would be fun to see what you guys want to ask a real one of them.",3,1580786939,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eyjlrr/iama_student_in_the_top_1_of_intelligence_ama/,IAmA,1

I train working Border Collies to help on my sheep farm in central Iowa and compete in sheepdog trials. I grew up with Border Collies as pet farm dogs but started training them to work sheep when I got my first one as an adult twelve years ago. Twelve years, five dogs, ten acres, a couple dozen sheep, and thousands of miles traveled, it is truly my passion and drives nearly everything I do. I've given numerous demos and competed in USBCHA sheepdog trials all over the midwest, as far east as Kentucky and west as Wyoming.

Luckily for me I was diagnosed with the side of the spectrum that has my mental disorder wear off over time and allows me to function as an average adult when I am older. 

I had to take many speech and communication classes to help with my ability to be shy and not really want to talk to other people. (I don't have anxiety, most with Autism just don't really like or can't communicate with others because they have restricted thoughts of behaviors and patterns according to Google)

I am currently 14 years old right now and my autism hasn't really impacted me that much since it now is like a piece of junk I will throw away eventually since I won't need or have it.

Cue the what was probably the worst 10 or so months of my life. After being charged, I plead 'not guilty' in the local magistrate's court and was granted bail (first offence, no priors, no outstanding warrants). 

8 months after the charges were laid, I stood for trial. After a 4 day trial (felt like 4 years), I was found **not guilty** by a jury of 12 after 4 hours of deliberation.

I work 35 hours a  week, and in exchange have all my needs amply met. I choose my own work  and am my own boss. I love it here, and wanted to let people know that  there are viable alternatives to mainstream living. AMA!

#### WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF CORONAVIRUS?

The common **symptoms of coronavirus** are discussed below:The symptoms of coronavirus are similar to any other upper respiratory infection. This includes runny nose, coughing, sore throat, headache. Sometimes fever can also be seen in the patient. In most cases, you don't differentiate the symptoms of coronavirus with others' like rhinovirus. So you can do some lab tests to be sure whether your symptoms are caused by coronavirus or not.Unfortunately, if the coronavirus spreads to the lower respiratory tracks it could as well cause pneumonia. This is more common in old people with heart disease. Also, the symptoms of coronavirus are mild. They go away in a few days like an ordinary virus infection.

ew6jfh,ufexplore,"I am a research professor who detects, isolates and performs genetic analysis of respiratory viruses, including coronaviruses and animal and human influenza viruses, as well as arboviruses. AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m John Lednicky, a virologist and research professor of environmental and global health at the University of Florida’s College of Public Health and Health Professions and the UF Emerging Pathogens Institute. I've been studying microbiology for more than 40 years.

I’m here to answer any questions you may have about the coronavirus, arboviruses, aerobiology and virus discovery.

My research focus areas at the University of Florida are:

* aerovirology or air-transported viruses
* virus discovery
* virus surveillance with emphasis on arthropod-borne viruses
* influenza virus studies

My laboratory was the first to detect Zika and Mayaro viruses in Haiti and has performed sequence analyses of Asian-lineage Chikungunya, and Dengue and other viruses isolated from Haitians or mosquitoes trapped in Haiti.

We also isolated and sequenced African-lineage Chikungunya viruses in mosquitoes from Haiti (these viruses to date have only been found in Africa and in a minority of specimens in Brazil).

Recently, we were the first in the world to discover Madariaga and Keystone viruses in humans.

My lab has also recently revealed the discovery of three new orbiviruses. 

Earlier this week, I was [interviewed by the *Gainesville Sun*](https://www.gainesville.com/news/20200128/uf-alerting-students-traveling-to-china-about-coronavirus) about the coronavirus.

[Proof!](https://twitter.com/UFExplore/status/1222894224338636807)

*Here’s a bit more about me:*

I received a Ph.D. in Microbiology from the University of Texas-Austin in 1991, an M.S. in Microbiology from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1984 and a B.S. in Microbiology from the University of Miami in 1978.

Prior to joining the University of Florida, I was an assistant professor of pathology at the Loyola Medical Center in Illinois. I then worked in industry, engaging in biodefense-related work and various projects with avian influenza H5N1 and other influenza viruses, and the production of biodiesel from alga.

Now that we know that half-life 3 isn't coming, I think we deserve some honest answers.


**My 5 Questions:**

1. At what point did you decide to stop working on the game?
2. Why did you decide not to release half-life 3?
3. What were the leaks that happened over the years (i.e. hl3.txt...)? Were they actually parts of some form of half-life 3?
4. How are people at valve reacting to the decision not to make half-life 3?
5. How do you think this decision will affect the way people look at the company in the future? How will it affect the release of your other new games?

Attention, this Post is long.

I hope my story will be interesting for you here. My name is Dan and I am a self-made Game-Designer from (one of many, I guess you have seen this guys already in here).

This story is about me and brother of mine making **small Indie RPG called ""Bogatyr""**. Imagine Witсher made by two slavs who work other job full-time in two years without any investments and it is Studio's second title? Here we are.

In General, **Bogatyr** is a game about ancient **slav** warrior who returned home from war and found his land devastated by unknown forces. Plot is about him trying to understand what is going on.

We were trying to make small non-linear game with skills we possessed and learned, with dialogue variety and little bit of trash funny **slavic** ideas (burning pigs, authentic weapons and local folklore). Actually, we wanted to make pretty looking world with wheat fields, birches and wooden **izbas** for own pleasure and, maybe, for someone who is also into theme.

So, after two years of work we found guy to write us soundtrack (best part of our game, seriously), tested it and fixed all the bugs (as we thought we did). Two weeks of polishing and we are ready to release.

Before the Catharsis of this story I need to make an off-top. I am Russian and I have another Job. I work 28/28 shift in Iraq and cannot say more due to confidential part of employment. And Internet here is... shit. So we wanted to publish game before I leave and have some time to fix it again if it is necessary (I am also a programmer).

28th of January is a release date, we publish our game and... My managers told me to go on shift earlier. I left , because I had no choice. We published game and thought it will be like with our first release (low sells, not that much reviews, people accepted it cold like every other amateur piece of art).

We posted announcements on Russian (Slav) web sites and it started. **CyberSlavs** are **Cyberbulling** me and my friend for two days. 100 000 views on Steam in 2 Days, 10 000 views on our piece of trash trailer and people are MAD about this game (some of them liked it though, ones who bought it on Steam, if believe first reviews). We were Second in new games in Steam for 2 days (have no idea about current situation). I have no idea why we have that much of attention, hundreds of comments on Slavs Feed we posted it. They thought that it was AAA project and started investigating, finding mistakes in trailers. Have never seen such an attention to a studio who made its second title.

**CyberSlavs** are still attacking. and I want to beware you. They will continue to **cyberbull** their own kind like us, and after will start bullying **non-slavs**.

Thanks for reading! I will leave 5 keys for game below in comments and thanks to attention!

And here are the best comments (translated with punctuation and main idea saved). Maybe we got same here, maybe not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Maybe you should see a psychologist.  
*Может тебе лучше к психологу?*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Downloaded pirate version of this game, piece of f\*ng sh\*t dont want to discuss that someone not believin in archtype of man ""better play first after judge"" may check it out themselves  
*Пиратку скачал полная параша даж обсуждать не охото кто так сказать не верующий так называемый архитип человека ""сначало поиграй потом говори"" могут сами убедится в этом*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Looks like pile of crap, but wish you good luck  
*Выглядит как говно, но желаю успехов.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;After comments like this guys make commit something badd with themselves. You better take an example from XVth century intercourse, lubricate them with praising first, after f\*ck them to death, and after that praise again.  
*После таких комментов и в отрыв можно. Помягче, ребята. Тут надо как в сексе XVв. Сначала смажьте похвалой, а потом уже жарьте, в конце еще похвалите.*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Damn f\*ck what a sh\*t f\*ckery  
*Блять ну и хуита*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Better go somewhere else  
*Уходи*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Long-awaited for whom? For yourself? Who's going to wait for this sh\*t? Spend 2 years in life to make nedo RPG with graphics of the Paleozoic era, with unbelievable system requirements, terrible animation it is hard to achieve. Go to the factory, making games is not your job to do  
*Долгожданного для кого? Для вас самих? Кто это говнище ждать будет? Потратить 2 года в жизни на то, чтобы сделать недо рпг с графикой полеозойской эры, с конскими системными требованями, ужасной анимацией это надо постараться. Идите на завод, игры делать это не ваше*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Well done, you did at least something. It will count in portfolio. Certainly, I will not play this crap. And nobody will.

evsnqr,theBratans,I am a Slav who made game about Ancient Slavs and got cyber-bullied by other Slavs,"Good day to you, **brothers and sisters!**

Attention, this Post is long.

I hope my story will be interesting for you here. My name is Dan and I am a self-made Game-Designer from (one of many, I guess you have seen this guys already in here).

This story is about me and brother of mine making **small Indie RPG called ""Bogatyr""**. Imagine Witсher made by two slavs who work other job full-time in two years without any investments and it is Studio's second title? Here we are.

In General, **Bogatyr** is a game about ancient **slav** warrior who returned home from war and found his land devastated by unknown forces. Plot is about him trying to understand what is going on.

We were trying to make small non-linear game with skills we possessed and learned, with dialogue variety and little bit of trash funny **slavic** ideas (burning pigs, authentic weapons and local folklore). Actually, we wanted to make pretty looking world with wheat fields, birches and wooden **izbas** for own pleasure and, maybe, for someone who is also into theme.

So, after two years of work we found guy to write us soundtrack (best part of our game, seriously), tested it and fixed all the bugs (as we thought we did). Two weeks of polishing and we are ready to release.

Before the Catharsis of this story I need to make an off-top. I am Russian and I have another Job. I work 28/28 shift in Iraq and cannot say more due to confidential part of employment. And Internet here is... shit. So we wanted to publish game before I leave and have some time to fix it again if it is necessary (I am also a programmer).

28th of January is a release date, we publish our game and... My managers told me to go on shift earlier. I left , because I had no choice. We published game and thought it will be like with our first release (low sells, not that much reviews, people accepted it cold like every other amateur piece of art).

We posted announcements on Russian (Slav) web sites and it started. **CyberSlavs** are **Cyberbulling** me and my friend for two days. 100 000 views on Steam in 2 Days, 10 000 views on our piece of trash trailer and people are MAD about this game (some of them liked it though, ones who bought it on Steam, if believe first reviews). We were Second in new games in Steam for 2 days (have no idea about current situation). I have no idea why we have that much of attention, hundreds of comments on Slavs Feed we posted it. They thought that it was AAA project and started investigating, finding mistakes in trailers. Have never seen such an attention to a studio who made its second title.

**CyberSlavs** are still attacking. and I want to beware you. They will continue to **cyberbull** their own kind like us, and after will start bullying **non-slavs**.

evqpvr,davebrophy,I hiked the Great Himalaya Trail for 154 days across the highest trails of Nepal. Ask me anything!,"Last summer my friend Mathi and I hiked the Great Himalaya Trail for 154 days across the highest and most remote trails of Nepal. Ask me anything!

The concept of the Great Himalaya Trail is to follow the highest elevation continuous hiking route across the Himalayas. The Nepal section stretches for 1,400 km (900 miles) from Kanchenjunga in the east to Humla in the west. It winds through the mountains with an average elevation of 3,750 m (12,300 ft), and up to 6,200 m (20,300 ft), with an average elevation change of 1,600 m (5,250 ft) per day. The route includes parts of the more commercialised treks, linking them together with sections that are so remote even the locals seldom hike there. 

I made a vlog video every day on the trek. It has an episode for each day, and follows the ups and downs of long distance trekking in the remotest corners of the most amazing place on earth. The first episode premiers on YouTube on Saturday, but here's a trailer:

evo3sd,dnearhos,I'm a hockey reporter covering the Tampa Bay Lightning for Florida's largest newspaper. AMA!,"Hey, everyone! I'm Diana C. Nearhos, and I've been covering the Tampa Bay Lightning for the [*Tampa Bay Times*](https://www.tampabay.com/sports/lightning/) for 16 months. Before that, I reported on minor league hockey (AHL and ECHL) in Glens Falls, N.Y. 

I'm at almost every practice and game, including on the road (checking in from L.A. this morning!), so I see a *lot* of hockey. Tampa Bay is a smaller NHL market, but the Lightning have been one of the league’s best teams for the past five years — so there’s always something interesting happening. 

My first year on the beat was spent covering a historic season as the Lightning ran away with the regular-season title only to collapse in the playoffs. This year, they’re trying to be a more well-rounded team, and it’s mostly working — Monday’s loss in Dallas being an example of when it isn’t. 

I also live on tea (and post my [pregame tea to Twitter](https://twitter.com/dianacnearhos/status/1212882103894970369) each game), and spend a lot of my travel time reading (to the tune of about 180 books a year).

Stranger: No my dad loves me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He cares about me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: That's why he sends me to school

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He works hard too but he isnt paid a lot

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But I want to just end it all now

&amp;#x200B;

You: If he cares about you and love you.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I cant deal with the pain again and again

&amp;#x200B;

You: He wouldn't have caused this to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: They tie me up so that I dont struggle and if I try they hit me until I stop

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: They dont always gag me though

&amp;#x200B;

You: WTF Summer

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Some say they want to hear me scream and plead

&amp;#x200B;

You: This is extremely unethical and wrong man

&amp;#x200B;

You: Noo

&amp;#x200B;

You: Noo maan

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But others want me to be absolutely silent

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Not make a single sound

&amp;#x200B;

You: Is this for real ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: 2 clients even had these things that they wrapped around my neck

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And if I made a sound it would give me an electric shock

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It didnt harm me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Just hurt me a lot if I made a noise

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I mean I get why they tie me up

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: The one time they didnt I almost got away

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So now it's a rule for me

&amp;#x200B;

You: Do you want me to contact the authorities for you ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: No

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I already told you that I want my dad safe

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Once I die he will not have to pay for my schooling

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And I have one last client tonight that I will go to before I kill myself

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: The money from that client will be completely his

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He can get a better job

&amp;#x200B;

You: Don't do this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Please.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And I will also be better off

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: You dont understand how excruciating it is okay?

&amp;#x200B;

You: I know

&amp;#x200B;

You: I told you earlier

&amp;#x200B;

You: It's uncomprehensible.

&amp;#x200B;

You: but

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: They have these huge penis shaped thing that they use instead if their penis sometimes

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And it hurts so much

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I have no idea what it's called though

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It vibrates and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Way more painful than a real penis

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And they dont care about how much it hurts

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: They said it will go the deepest inside me and they can get any angle they want or smth like that

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Do you have any idea what it's called?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Sorry I dont know a lot of stuff cause I'm only 13

&amp;#x200B;

You: Can't really member

&amp;#x200B;

You: I'm not into these psycho stuff.,

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Well whatever it it

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It hurts so bad

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And sometimes they make me gag on their dick even if it's really big they force it down my throat and thrust so hard

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It makes me gag to the point where I feel like I would puke but because i eont eat nothing really comes out

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Lucky for them I dont think they would want to deal with me puking haha

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's super fucked up

&amp;#x200B;

You: Look

&amp;#x200B;

You: What would make you feel happy for now ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Hey by any chance you know the difference between whore and slut

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Both ate used so often

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Are\*

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I think I have an idea what they mean but is there a difference?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Again sorry I'm young and dont know a lot of stuff so excuse me

&amp;#x200B;

You: It's okay summer.

&amp;#x200B;

You: You shouldn't know these stuiff anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Well they say it so often

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: What's the harm in knowing what it means?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Once there was this guy who put his member in my mouth and pushed it all the way in

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And then didnt move at all

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And I couldn't breathe at all

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And my hands were ties so I couldn't even push him away

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Tied\*

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I started panicking so much

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He wouldnt let me move my head away

&amp;#x200B;

You: Do you've a social media account ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: No my dad doesnt let me have one

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He said he enjoyed the way my throat felt around him

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And I dont really remember what happened after that but I think I passed out

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And when I got up he had still not left and was fucking into me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Fir a few seconds I couldn't move and I was really confused

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But I remember feeling so scared

&amp;#x200B;

You: Look

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I can't forget that dad

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Day\*

&amp;#x200B;

You: \\There's no need to mention this details summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm so sorry

&amp;#x200B;

You: It's probably traumatizing you.

&amp;#x200B;

You: No need to remember this horrible memorioes.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm making you uncomfortable arent I?

&amp;#x200B;

You: You thing is

&amp;#x200B;

You: What can i do to make your life bntter ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: No actually its making me feel better that I can finally let out my fears

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: You cant do anything

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm just really happy that you're listening

&amp;#x200B;

You: If that'

&amp;#x200B;

You: that's making you feel better

&amp;#x200B;

You: then you can let it all out.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I want some one to kinda know what happened to me cause I'm gonna die anyways

&amp;#x200B;

You: As i said earlier ""Find something to poour your grief and anger onto""

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Even if you will never know me

&amp;#x200B;

You: Well

&amp;#x200B;

You: I can't live with the fact that i talked to someone that's gonna suicide within the next few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I couldn't even tell my closest friend about it

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's gonna affect me also.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Therefore i'm willing to talk to you to find a solution to help you and make your life a bit better at least.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Luckily my dad has never booked that particular client again

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It's okay we can stop talking

&amp;#x200B;

You: Ok look

&amp;#x200B;

You: You said earlier that you don't wanna report to the authorities about your dad so he won't get hurt, Right ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm sure other people have it worse

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Mine isnt too bad

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Yeah

&amp;#x200B;

You: Why don't you go and live with someone else ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I lost my mom a few years ago

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And I dont really know any relatives that live nearby

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I cant live with all these memories haunting me anyway

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Even if I do escape

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And really j feel like I might be making you uncomfortable

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Just tell me and you can leave me

&amp;#x200B;

You: There's an escape button i could've pressed long time ago. :D

&amp;#x200B;

You: But i didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Initially I just wanted to tell someone and know what they thought about it cause I dont know how normal people usually think about this

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I feel like you might be disgusted with me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: You keep saying its fucked up and no way

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Is it really that bad?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I honestly don't know what to compare it to

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So I dont know if my situation is bad or if I'm lucky

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

You: Tell me what do you think.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: As I said I dont know what to compare it to

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But it's made me miserable so I dont like it at all

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So what you think please?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Tell me what\*

&amp;#x200B;

You: Don't really know man.

&amp;#x200B;

You: What your father did to you was definitely bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But in sure someone else has it worse than me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It just feels horrible you know

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Knowing that they really dont care if you're in pain

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: That you're being forced to do stuff like this

&amp;#x200B;

You: As if you were some kind of a doll.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Well one if the clients said

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: That a helpless child is like a doll that should be used

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: When they blind fold me it makes it scqrier

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Scarier

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Cause I dont know what's gonna happen

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Oh hey I figured out the name if the thing that is shaped like a penis

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I googled it and I think it's called a dildo

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Bit a lot of them I saw here arent as big as the ones they use on me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: The ones they use are fucking broad and so long

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I've cried almost everytime they used it

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Some people dont even use lubes

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Lube\*

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It's so bad I almost pass out from the pain

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I dont know if my pain tolerance is low cause maybe I'm a kid but without lube I scream

&amp;#x200B;

You: Look

&amp;#x200B;

You: If you put a dildo into Zeus's ass he won't handle it also.

&amp;#x200B;

You: It's extremely painful

&amp;#x200B;

You: I can imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Except for with those 2 clients who put that shock thing on my nevk

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Even then I cant stop a few sounds and the shock is always painful so I try to not make a single sound

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Cant always help it though

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Most of then dont use condoms

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So I have to always be on pills

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Cause I cannot risk getting pregnant

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Ove recently started to feel even weaker than usual though

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Ive\*

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm not sure why

&amp;#x200B;

You: Obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

You: This is not natural or health for a 13yo girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I think it's because of the eating disorder

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I've been losing a lot if weight

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Of\*

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: A few times I've passed out when I was supposed to be satisfying the client

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And so they reduced the pay

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: My dad was really mad

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: After this happened a couple of times

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: He called one of the clients he knew who was also a doctor

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So he came with this kit and put me on an iv

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Also said my haemoglobin was really low

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's the cell that's in the blood that's carries the oxygen to the body

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And so today after weeks of discussion my dad finally paid to do a blood transfer so that my haemoglobin rises cause I've been fainting so much

&amp;#x200B;

You: yea.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Oh really I didn't know that

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Again sorry I still have a lotta stuff to learn

&amp;#x200B;

You: Well Summer

&amp;#x200B;

You: I hope this conversationjj is making you feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Yeah it is

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I still feel like I might be making you uncomfortsbke

&amp;#x200B;

You: If its making you feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's all that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

You: anyway

&amp;#x200B;

You: look

&amp;#x200B;

You: that's my fb

&amp;#x200B;

You: [https://www.facebook.com/umarmmf](https://www.facebook.com/umarmmf)

&amp;#x200B;

You: If you need someone to contact

&amp;#x200B;

You: I'm here.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm sorry my dad diesnt let me have any social media

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Besides I only have a few hours left

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Just waiting to be done with that client

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And then I can have peace

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I hope he isnt too rough

&amp;#x200B;

You: Still planning on that ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I mean yeah

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I have to finish the client

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: The doctor client had come today and he said I was in pretty bad shape

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: My blood pressure was low too

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Which was also one of the reasons I've been passing out

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Said my pulse was also kinda slow and stuff

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Which is why he was really insistent on the blood being given today

&amp;#x200B;

You: What would change your mind ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I was supposed to rest for a day or 2 after the transfusion

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But the client is leaving for another city tomorrow and it was an advance payment

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: So I cant get out of it

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I don't know if anything would change my mind

&amp;#x200B;

You: How about this.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Why don't you post-pone it at least 'til tomorrow

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Why?

&amp;#x200B;

You: Because i gotta leave now to get something done.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I have another client tomorrow

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I dont wan to go again

&amp;#x200B;

You: And i've already post-poned already talking to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm sorry its okay

&amp;#x200B;

You: no no

&amp;#x200B;

You: Don't apolgoize.

&amp;#x200B;

You: It's okay.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I've made my mind about it being today

&amp;#x200B;

You: Wouldn't feel better hurting these people that sexually assaulted you instead of surrendering.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Would that feel better ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I guess the transfusion was a waste of my dad's money

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I dont want to hurt them. They've paid for it so they have the right to do whatever they want to me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I just cant do this anymore

&amp;#x200B;

You: FUCK NO

&amp;#x200B;

You: They've no righ to do that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

You: C'mon man\]

&amp;#x200B;

You: This is extremely wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: But they pay

&amp;#x200B;

You: Paying for something like that is wrong in the first place

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I mean I'm 13 so they probably want a young kid

&amp;#x200B;

You: Summer, don't be weak and surrender to depression like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Not an adult

&amp;#x200B;

You: Fight that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

You: IOt's hard af

&amp;#x200B;

You: i know

&amp;#x200B;

You: but c'mon

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: When I was 10 it worse because I had no idea what was happening and only knew that it was horrible and it that it hurt like hell

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I told I tried fighting once(the time they had decided not to tie me up)

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I had scratched them and had almost run away but he caught me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: And that day he whipped me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: 100 times

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I had to count and apologize each time he hit me

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I've given up after that

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: It's almost time to leave for the last client

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Gosh I feel like I cant stand without feeling dizzy

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: How am I supposed to please him

&amp;#x200B;

You: Run away summer

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's all i got for you.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Go to a fooster home or somethin'

&amp;#x200B;

You: That'd be x10 better than living in this shit everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm sorry

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I can't

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I wanna end this forever

&amp;#x200B;

You: Well

&amp;#x200B;

You: I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

You: But for some reason

&amp;#x200B;

You: You don't wanna change your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Don't really know what should i do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I dont want to change my mind

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Thanks for listening

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: You dont need to do anything

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Wow you might be the last person I talk to before killing myself

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: The client isnt an option because I'm gonna be gagged

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Oh wow

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: You're special hehe

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Byee

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Love you.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Please

&amp;#x200B;

You: Don't do it

&amp;#x200B;

You: Later on, You'll thank god you didn't

&amp;#x200B;

You: Time heals

&amp;#x200B;

You: Grief gets buried

&amp;#x200B;

You: Just don't surrender.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Seems like nonsense to you right now.

&amp;#x200B;

You: but listen to a guy who lost a lot of people he loves and was mentally harmed.

&amp;#x200B;

You: That's all i got to say.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm sorry to disappoint you

&amp;#x200B;

You: I wish i'd have had this conversation with you physically

&amp;#x200B;

You: Like face to face

&amp;#x200B;

You: So i can literally help you changing your life to the better.

&amp;#x200B;

You: Unfortunately i can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: Its okay

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: I'm gonna be fine

&amp;#x200B;

You: So you won't suicide ?

&amp;#x200B;

You: ?

&amp;#x200B;

Stranger: No I'm not saying that

Stranger: I'm just gonna be happy you know?

evm39k,antoooo7,"Hi, i’m Antoniu Cretescu , and i want to change my life in good.","In the beginning i want to Introduce myself, i am Antoniu Cretescu, i have 23 yo and it’s my first post on reddit (don’t be mean please :D ).  So let’s start. At this moment i work as a bartender for an Italian restaurant in Timisoara, România. I quit 2 universities because our education sistem is “under the level of sea”.  Because i don’t come from a rich familly i started to work. At this moment i feel very capped with my life and i want to start over. A very big problem is that i don’t have a passion or something to fight for and cant’t see what i want to do in the futute. Probably this is one of the reasons why i feel So down and bored. Another one is that i don’t have Any friends.
The good part is that i managed to take social media marketing course ( in special Instagram) and i really feel that this is an option to start over.  I feel a big energy inside of me and i feel i can do big things. I wrote this because i needed to Tell somewone whats happening inside of me. In the end i want to ask you if you have Any tips or informations about social media marketing (pages to like, webinars, good books) or Any life tips. Thank you reddit Bros for making my days better.

evhquj,oldman_jazz,I am 83 years old. I was periodically homeless on the streets of San Fransisco from age 7-18. I wrote a book based on my survival. AMA,"My son (typing this) is helping me answer any of your questions you have on my experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

The key events from my childhood featured in my book include:

\-shattering every single one of my teeth

\-the murder of my father (for being a homosexual) &gt; my theory

\-living with my alcoholic mother

\-hiding the above by deceiving the authorities and forging documents

\-my rape and my meticulously planned revenge

\-an unlikely friendship with an elderly Chinese grocer (who was my fence)

\-abandoning life with my mother and living on/off the streets

\-numerous encounters with the predators of San Francisco

&amp;#x200B;

(Son here) My father has lived an incredible life and only recently have I truly begun to grasp the harrowing childhood he had. My father has always been a happy-go-lucky man who could always make me laugh and never showed me anything but his classic quirky demeanor. Needless to say, I was floored when he sat me down on my 16th birthday and told me his story. It has taken me a long time to even wrap my head around the fact that my weirdo dad that binges Scandinavian murder mysteries, and plays the ukulele is deep down a hard-as-nails bona fide survivor that knows pain I can't even begin to imagine.

&amp;#x200B;

His words:

""The telling of this story has been 60+ years in the making, and it was with excruciating pain that I have finally finished recounting the demons that have haunted me since childhood into a 103000 word book. It is a story of my survival from age 7 on the streets of San Francisco after my father was murdered, and my mother that turned to alcohol for solace, amid a 20th century coming-of-age story of a hero's journey to the the depths of hell and back again.""

&amp;#x200B;

[PICTURE PROOF (kinda) as you can imagine we can't exactly show you proof that any of this really happened, but hopefully you can accept the second chapter of his book as a taste of a book to come. Also included, a working picture of the cover.](https://imgur.com/a/iaO1OqZ)

eumbaq,_NotPlayingGames892_,I filed a DCMA &amp; brought my lawywer in.,"Hi, so, uh, there is going to be a bit of a backstory to this one. 

I had a friend, but were not friends now. From early 2018 to late June/July 2019 - Her &amp; me wrote a story together and were considered joint tenants regarding the book in my country. 

I have hired a lawyer who deals with Intellectual property and he explained to me that the book is joint work and were both the authors, hence 'joint tenancy' and that it would be illegal for the book to be re-written and published for me to to do those things without her consent and illegal for her to do those things without my consent. 

We both would have to agree on all decisions. I had strong reason to believe she was re-writing our book for publication based on a number of drawings and written statements on her social media. The characters names were diffrent, but they were near identical to their selves from our book and many statements she made about the plot of her new book strong resembled the plot of our book. 

With all this, I went to my lawyer, explained all this and he said my countries juristiction applies. Before going to my lawyer, I tried to ask my friend about this new book of hers. I never recieved a response and before all this, after her and me finished the book, she asked me if I'd agree for our to be re-written for publication, but I'd have no control over any changes to the book, she'd do everything, I could just relax. 

I'd recieved 20% of the profits, so if the book made a $1000 - she'd recieved alot more money than me for a book we both own, but my name would appear on the book too. The offer changed to her paying$20 for the entire base outline of the plot so and she'd become the owner of the entire book.

I think this is screwing me over on something I worked on to. So these offers and then seeing art and statements reflecting our book is why I went and saw my lawyer as I strongly suspected and believed her of amending our book.

She's in a diffrent country to me, but her country is a part of the Berne Covention and I paid out a private detective at the suggestion of my lawyer as I needed to know who exactly my friend was. My lawyer wrote out a letter of demand for her, including her personal details. 

I suspect the letter scared her as her social media all went private and she's not going to accept a follow request from me obviously. I won't know if she's still infringing. 

While the letter is scary, I also sent a copy of the letter to the social platform asking them to remove her art pieces &amp; statements. I have no idea if it was successful, but I guess the privating part of her account was as a result of recieveing the DCMA too and thinks that she an hide behind a private account and possibly re-upload her art &amp; statements, telling our book.

I won't know and won't and be able to submit another DCMA again. Am I an asshole for wanting to protect my legal rights to a book I worked on.

I feel like one. She's likely angry I filed a DCMA and thst my lawyer sent a letter of demand with her personal details on it. Details I wouldn't have known without hiring a private detective.

Also, before the book was finished, back in 2018 - After 35 chapters of the book which stated that it was a joint work, one of the books fans thought my friend was the author &amp; praised her on amazing story and more.

I feel left out our book. I corrected the fan &amp; maybe I was a little harsh, but after 35 chapters, I feel people should know better. In pm afterwards, my ex-friend yelled at me, saying I was rude and I tried to explain how much it hurt for someone to think she was the only author, she didn't care and proceeded to tell me I was rude. 

Does trying to point this out make me an a-hole also? Slight anger at a lack of recognition as one of the books authors I feel is a normal emotion &amp; reaction. 


Please let me know you think, I guess...

I really do feel like a horrible monster who's selfish in the world for doing the things I've done such as finding out her personal details to proceed legally and refusing to agree for the book to re-written and publish and not taking the $20 I was offered, but maybe that's me having low self-esteem or something else. I have no idea honestly and I'm going to have to go back to my lawyer now as this is going to be hard to know if she's still infringing potentially for the future and telling people all about her book because all her accounts have been made private now.",2,1580121642,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eumbaq/i_filed_a_dcma_brought_my_lawywer_in/,IAmA,1

euhnrh,graphiticc,"I am a recently diagnosed adaptive sociopath, and I love the title","I am 20 years old and have recently been diagnosed an “adaptive sociopath”. 
I’ve known something was “wrong” with me for about a decade now, but in all honestly I like having the professional title for some reason. 

I have always been deceiving. Even as a kid I was stealing from stores, sneaking out my house, lying to my parents and getting away with all of it. Every time I did something behind someone’s back, I got quite the rush. There’s really nothing for me to compare it to, just a big feeling of  accomplishment I suppose. Like I thought of this plan and I perfectly executed it. But after I grew up, these small lies and acts weren’t giving me the same type of rush I would have normally felt, so clearly I needed to up my scale. 
Long story short, it’s gotten to the point to where my entire family and closest group of friends believe I have been in school for 3 years now. When in actuality I dropped out. After my first semester. 
I don’t necessarily care for the well being of others. I seems to really lack a grasp of remorse and empathy. I’m also a fairly attractive person which has made all of these endeavors terribly easy. Who doesn’t trust an attractive person ? You just want to befriend them.

eugodz,Fiammettaa,I am an asian girl here are 10 of my kinkies,"I'm a slim Asian girl of 162cm check my photos if you are interested and cute. 


1. I like to be forced. So I like fucking guys that I don't like so it feels like I'm forced. But I never look for guys that I don't like to fuck by myself. And I like being dominated and insulted during sex. 

2. I fantasy people that have power over me, for example a severe teacher. 

3. I like watching doggy porns even if it's not my favorite pose.

4. I like small dicks. I think it's not kinky because for me small dicks don't hurt.

5. One interesting fact about me is that I never had an orgasm during sex except for oral.

6. I like tall American guys with good voice. I think it's because of 1. Since in my school when we were learning English we studied only American accent and we listened to the American accent tape every day so an American guy is kind of like some authority something but I'm not sure. While I don't like the way Americans kiss. But I don't study French while I like French guys. Maybe because I always want to learn French and I think it sounds so beautiful. 

7. I fantasy doctors, maybe due to 2.

8. I think my back is as sensitive as my pussy. I think I can even get an orgasm by touching my back very gently for 15min. But I have never tried that since I don't have a stable patient sex partner. And my arms are not long and flexible enough.

9. I fantasy being raped by someone or being seduced and forced by a high school teach due to 1. and 2. How i want to be seduced. Not in a stupid way. 

10. I fantasy being peeked while having sex or sex in public like on the podium with the audience unexpectedly getting aroused. 

P. S. Ah my favorite pose is the missionary just because it hurts the least. But I just realized that it might always be because that the guys' dicks are too big.

eualgv,blacklistedfork,Draino/works bombs," I am here because I just learned people have caught heavy charges for this. I know this is old news but I would like to see it on a larger scale than a 20 oz soda bottle. So I suggested it to a YouTube channel that blow all sorts of things more about this below.
       I  have done this a few times, and it is more than a few seconds before the reaction starts and goes off. One has plenty of time to insert materials, secure cap, and, take cover. 
      I have never done it for  nefarious reasons. I just did it to have a lil fun. I did not do it in city limits, or to blow up anything, but the bottle. I did not do it to hurt anyone or damage anything. 
    Yes its a dangerous thing to do but safety was always in mind. I was able to put materials in a plastic soda bottle, (not hardened plastic or glass), secure the cap, and throw the bottle at least 50 feet away, as well as run the opposite direction. 
    It was just a loud boom, no fire, no destruction. Maybe a minute if any, crater, where the bottle landed, and blew up in a grassy area, not near anything.  
     I had no idea one could get such charges for this, unless maybe, they were doing it for nefarious reasons. Which in this case, seems  in a way, they did, by doing it in other people's yards. 
      The reason I came to this post is because I suggested a YouTube channel hosts do it on a larger scale. They blow stuff up all the time and have plenty of room to safely do it. I mentioned maybe making a video and sending it to them, and a guy told me bout kids that caught a bunch of charges for this. 
     I will not be making a video, as I don't want to incriminate myself. I do hope though, the channel I suggested this to, do do it. They are self proclaimed ""professionals"" some of you may know the channel(s) I'm speaking of, for they have done a lot of dangerous and stupid things. They do these types of things for fun and views. Their channels, are quite large, so why not suggest it.",3,1580063614,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eualgv/drainoworks_bombs/,IAmA,1

I picked up the bass guitar about a year ago and fell in love with it immediately.

My favourite artists are the Arctic Monkeys, The Libertines and RHCP.

I am in a school band with some pals and we have a gig/concert to play, and I have the riff learnt and perfected, and when I am home I can play with expression and movement. 

Yet everytime I get onto the stage, I stare down at the ground, afraid of what people will think if I mess up. And the thought itself makes me mess up.

If you guys have any advice, please let me know.

etr9mc,ricardo-5566,Hello! We are therapists Johanne Schwensen (Clinical psychologist) and Jakob Lusensky (Jungian psychoanalyst) from It's Complicated. Ask us anything about therapy!,"Hello! We are therapists Johanne Schwensen (Clinical psychologist) and Jakob Lusensky (Jungian psychoanalyst), counsellor colleagues and co-founders of the therapy platform It's Complicated. Ask us anything – about therapy, life as therapists, and finding the right therapist!

Our short bio:

""Life is complicated, finding a therapist shouldn't be.” This was the founding principle when we established the project and platform It's Complicated. We wanted to make it easier to get matched with the right therapist.

I, Johanne, practice integrative therapy (combining modalities like CBT, ACT, and narrative therapy) and Jakob is a Jungian psychoanalyst. Despite our different approaches to therapy, we share the belief that the match matters the most. In other words, we think that what makes for succesful therapy isn’t a specific technique but the relationship between the client and therapist. (This, by the way, is backed by research).

That’s why, when we’re not working as therapists, we try to simplify clients' search for the right therapist through It’s Complicated.

So ask us anything – about therapy, life as therapists, and finding the right therapist. 

NB! We're not able to provide any type of counselling through reddit but if you’re interested in doing therapy, you can contact us or one of the counsellors listed on www.complicated.life.

AMA.,"I look like you're generic edgy teenager, I'm usually quiet and don't have many friends, I journal to pass the time. People make a lot of assumptions about me. Someone reported me to the office saying I had a list of names, so I was pulled from class by 3 administrators and an armed police officer who made me let him carry my backpack. They questioned me for an hour and gave me a pat down. They also read through my journal. It happened a second time and they found an entry with lots of insults directed at them. They were gonna let me go until they saw it, 20 minutes turned into an hour, they searched my car, threatened to send me to a mental health facility called Centerstone, and photocopied those pages of my journal to add to my record.

etaa92,SexOffenderAMA,IamA unemployable sex offender with no license. AMA!,"I am thirty-one, live at home with my mother, have no license or car, no credit, no formal education, no skills, and I have all of three thousand dollars to my name.

When I was seventeen, my fifteen-year-old cousin came to stay with my family for an extended period of time. We had been carrying on a consensual sexual relationship for some time previously, and this continued while she was staying here. But she had a boyfriend at the time and, evidently, felt guilty about cheating on him with me. She reported me to my aunt, who reported me to the police.

I pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal sexual abuse of a minor. I served no prison time, and indeed my sentence was remarkably light - effectively probation.

But the knowledge that my future was over crushed my spirits. I no longer had the drive to pursue anything. I led the NEET life for six years, before getting my driver's license at age twenty-three. I had it for only a few months before losing it to a DUI. My license was suspended for six months, and when I was eligible to get it back I had mo vehicle. I didn't get another car for three years.

I landed a job at a local medical equipment service and held it down for all of a month. During this time I began seeing a woman, but things quickly went south when I discovered that she had a boyfriend at the time. I got drunk, again, and refused to blow when the inevitable happened. I have been sitting on a mandatory revocation of my license for six years now. I had not reported my employment for fear of being fired. This was discovered during the investigation, and I also received a felony conviction for failure to report. This reset the period in which I have to register for another ten years.

Last year, my great-grandmother passed away. I inherited sixty thousand dollars. I started the slow process of getting my license back, and was one AA meeting away from being able to do so when I ran into an ex-girlfriend of mine who I discovered was hooked on heroin and swore she was ready to get clean and get it together with me. I heavily intervened in her life, out of love, and now have three thousand dollars left to me. In the process I picked up a driving on a revoked ticket after she went to inpatient rehab and I had to drive myself to work, in an attempt to be penny wise and pound foolish by avoiding paying for Ubers for the month she was gone.

I live in a town of 300 people. There are no jobs available to me.

I, functionally, have no future. At any point on the way I could have turned things around - gotten my license and gotten my ass into a trade school as soon as I was convicted initially, learned better coping mechanisms than drinking, or not have fallen in love with a heroin addict who used me to get a house given to her by her grandmother and to support her until I had nothing more to give.

My mother has a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy on me, and I know that my grandmother will leave me something. It almost certainly will not be enough to even get a crack at starting out in life.

I don't even have the technical skills most NEETs develop as a matter of necessity, as my interests have always been socio-political and literary. I have no handyman skills whatsoever. The one practical thing I can think to do with myself is to take an online course in plumbing from Penn Foster, but I know I will never be a plumber. My mother has recommended becoming a perennial student, living off student loans the rest of my (undoubtedly short) life. I have thought about angling for an Associate's degree in logistics because of all the factories near my house, but my lack of relevant work experience would surely be a bar to employment unless I used a reference faking service likeCareerExcuse.

My mother has expressed her acceptance of having to support me in an involuntary NEET lifestyle for the rest of my life. But she is barely working-class herself. And leveraging her into helping me get off the ground in anything would probably break her.

Ask me anything!

My previous two posts can be found [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8kwxk3/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bsbndl/iaman_air_traffic_controller_this_time_last_year/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). I **HIGHLY** recommend checking those out as they have an incredible amount of information in them. 


The FAA will be posting another “off the street” hiring bid **TOMORROW.**


There are people working as Air Traffic Control Trainees both at the academy and out in the field *today* because they saw one of my previous posts, went through the hiring process, and made it.


Below you will find the most pertinent information from the main body of my most recent AMA.

————————————————————————


Things you should understand: 


- This is a **long** and seemingly arbitrary process. There are people who saw my post last year, applied, and never got beyond the application process. Others got to the next step to take the AT-SA (an entrance exam of sorts) and never got a response from the FAA after that. Others passed the AT-SA and received a tentative offer letter (TOL) but are still going through the different clearances as we speak a year later.


- You will 99.9% have to relocate. The FAA does not care where you want to live. You will have limited options upon passing the academy that will be presented to you solely based on national staffing needs. There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren’t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. 


- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. 


*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You’ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it’s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you’ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.


If anybody has any interest whatsoever in this, please don’t hesitate to comment and/or PM me. I will respond to **everyone** eventually.",229,1579817720,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/et0g75/iaman_air_traffic_controller_tomorrow_the_faa/,IAmA,1

esv0c0,AHC_Podcast,We’re the show hosts (&amp; writers &amp; producers) of AHC Podcast. We just put out a double episode on Jeffrey Epstein. Ask us anything about Jeffrey Epstein or whatever you want.,"Hi Reddit!

Mikey, Randy, &amp; Buddy here. We’re the show-hosts of AHC Podcast; an independent comedy podcast in which we research infamous people, discuss them and then rate how horrible we think they are (on a 1-11 scale). 

Our latest episode is about Jeffrey Epstein. After doing the research for the show, we realized that there was so much stuff that was worth covering that we ended up having to run two full episodes on this guy. 

In the first episode, we discuss his early years: his schooling, his short-lived career as a teacher, his introduction to the financial world as an analyst at Bear Stearns, and the formation of his mysterious asset management company, J. Epstein &amp; Co. In the second episode, we delve into the headline-grabbing sex-crimes, his climb up the ultra-wealthy and powerful social ladder, his arrest, his sham sentencing, his rearrest and ultimately his very-questionable death.

You can listen to the first episode \[here\]([https://www.ahcpodcast.com/e/jeffrey-epstein-episode-1/](https://www.ahcpodcast.com/e/jeffrey-epstein-episode-1/)) and the second episode \[here\]([https://www.ahcpodcast.com/e/jeffrey-epstein-episode-2/](https://www.ahcpodcast.com/e/jeffrey-epstein-episode-2/)). Or just download it on your preferred podcast platform-- Apple, Spotify, et cetera. (Just a heads up: there is definitely swearing and other adult content in the podcast.)

As for the show itself, we all grew up together and have been close friends for over twenty years. We decided to do the podcast as a hobby and to give us another reason to hang out. It isn’t always easy, but we’ve had a lot of fun working on it. 

So, ask us anything about Jeffrey Epstein or whatever you feel like! We’ll be here pretty much all day answering every question that we can. (There may be some delayed responses at times because we’re doing this from our full-time jobs, but it shouldn’t be very long at all.)

esj7x2,EvilBoobsKing,"I am developing controversial political games in Russia. Because of my last game, the Communist Party of Russia hunted me down, and I was forced into hiding, moving in with distant relatives.","Good afternoon, folks! My name is Georg, last time I did an AMA here,I talked about the challenges of creating a controversial adult game with some releigious overtones in Russia and all the threats that came from the opponents of such content, including religious fanatics and sex-negative conservaties.

PROOF: https://steamcommunity.com/games/1085750/announcements/detail/1685970320507554348

And now, to balance it out, I was able to anger the Russian Communist Party by making another game. In essence, it’s a branching narrative game about a time traveler meeting with the Joseph Stalin himself. Through the course of the game, you can try to kill Stalin, change his worldview, and even seduce him and partake in some hot gay action with him (cue all the jokes about luxury gay space communism). There are 27 endings planned, each one with an exploration on how the world would look depending on the outcome of your conversation (and actions).

In May I announced the game, there was a slight surge of interest, but I just could not have imagined what would happen next. A small Polish gaming media learned about Sex with Stalin. The Poles generally do not like Stalin for obvious reasons, and they were delighted to see this game, One made by a Russian, to boot. It made some waves on the general european scenes, and ultimately attracted the attention of some of my compatriots who still worship the cult of the Great Leader. Tempers flared, and then even some of the largest Russian state-owned media outlets joined in on the action. At first, there were only a few disapproving nods, but then the host of a political talk show (imagine the very worst of your political commentary show, only with much more shouting) decided to devote a whole episode to the “Defilers of the Great History of the USSR”. Representatives of the Communist Party were also invited there. Of course, they could not appear indecisive. The Communists immediately convened a meeting and made a statement that the game should be immediately banned, and the authors punished by fine, or better yet, imprisoned. By making such game, in their opinion, I dishonor the history of our country and insult all the citizens of Russian. Their leader - Zyuganov, called me a Nazi collaborator. They also tracked down Stalin’s great-granddaughter, and talked her into writing a letter to Putin. Quite a few things in our country can be solved by writing a letter to Putin.

After this, all hell broke loose. Journalists besieged me - they constantly called me on my mobile phone (so much for privacy), drowned me in vaguely threatening mail, and even came to my hometown and showed the house where I live and all my neighbours’ houses on live TV. They showed my face, name, place of residence on a number of Russian political shows, and continued to discuss the game in major talk shows. In the evening, after seeing one such show, I decided to go out and get some air to clear the head. Some stranger came up to me, claiming that he knew me from somewhere. I tried to get away from him, but he followed me right to the very doorstep of my house. The very next day, someone threw some eggs at my house windows.
By this time I received so many threats that I started to simply ignore them. In the end, after reading a couple tens of messages about how I should be sent to the Gulag, be shot and maybe then quartered, it’s unlikely that I’ll learn anything new by reading another. I decided that I could no longer expose my family and neighbors to all this, and went into hiding. Some distant relatives living in a smaller town sheltered me for a while. Even then I could not sleep peacefully. It was reported that the Investigative Committee (our country-wide prosecution department) began a preliminary investigation, and there was a significant chance that they will go ahead with prosecution. In our country, only about 1% of all cases results in acquittal. You can imagine my dismay. Or maybe you can’t, but I was very dismayed.

I am fond of brewing Russian moonshine called Samogon. This is a pretty fascinating aspect of Russian culture dating back centuries, my grandfather and great-grandfather all did this. I like to drink samogon, too, but I always drank in moderation. But stress from all this happening got to me and I started to drink more, much more. I was incredibly lucky that my relatives who sheltered me supported me and did not allow me to drink myself to death . Then, and I could not believe my luck, it all passed. The media switched to other topics (new sanctions, the threat of war with Iran, etc.). The Investigative Committee either decided not to prosecute, or my case got buried in bureaucracy and there was no political pressure to pursue it anymore. Threats mostly stopped, too. I guess no one was this mad to actually travel to my neck of the woods. I mostly stopped drinking, got back home and returned to developing my games. I don’t know what awaits me in the future, but so far I am alive and free.

P.S. And apparently I just can’t lead a normal boring gamedev life, so I somehow got involved with Ukrainian developers making a game that makes fun of Russian security services. I guess I should prepare for a visit from the FSB (this is the russian analogue of the FBI). Hopefully, I won’t be shot and buried in on of Russia’s cold forests.

————————————————————————


Things you should understand: 


- This is a **long** and seemingly arbitrary process. There are people who saw my post last year, applied, and never got beyond the application process. Others got to the next step to take the AT-SA (an entrance exam of sorts) and never got a response from the FAA after that. Others passed the AT-SA and received a tentative offer letter (TOL) but are still going through the different clearances as we speak a year later.


- You will 99.9% have to relocate. The FAA does not care where you want to live. You will have limited options upon passing the academy that will be presented to you solely based on national staffing needs. There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren’t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. 


- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. 


*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You’ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it’s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you’ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.

I have the honour to be chairman of the Dutch Association for Agriculture and Horticulture (LTO Nederland). We represent Dutch farmers towards national and European policy makers and broader society. We have about 35.000 members, who are responsible for almost two-thirds of the Dutch agricultural production. I am an arable farmer myself - I mainly grow wheats, winter wheats, and sugar beets in the northern Netherlands. 

The Netherlands is the 2nd exporter of agrifood products in the world, and we're proud to have the best agricultural and horticultural university in the world: Wageningen University and Research. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. We have had a pretty tumultuous year, culminating in massive demonstrations last autumn. 

I look forward to learn about your ideas on how we are going to feed 10 billion people in 2050 whilst protecting our environment and safeguarding the liveability of the countryside and livelihood of one of the oldest professions in the world, farmers. 

I'll be answering questions starting 1 PM EST, which is 7 PM here in the Netherlands. Ask me anything!

erk3m6,Phoenix_flight_,I Am A disabled kink educator and shibari artist,"Good evening Reddit,

I have been active in the UK BDSM/kink scene for the last 8 years, and in that time I have run munches (casual meet ups), workshops, conventions and play parties. Events I have been heavily involved in include KinkFest - a weekend educational kink convention, and UK Rope Exchange - a rope bondage skill sharing event. I also organise Rope-a-Thon, which in the last four years has raised over £5,000 for local charities. I teach shibari/kinbaku, which is Japanese influenced rope bondage, and often do bondage photo shoots.

I have cerebral palsy, which affects my dexterity, balance, coordination, stamina and speech, among other things. I have found that the kink community has been very accepting of disabled people, but as with all areas of life, there is still room for improvement.

I have given talks about disability, sex, kink and polyamory at [London Polyday](http://2019.polyday.org.uk/) and the [Ethical Nonmonogamies &amp; Contemporary Intimacies](https://nmciconference.com/) conference.

Happy to talk about kink, rope bondage &amp; bondage art, ethical non-monogamy and disability.

I am an Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Doctor who does food allergy immunotherapy (OIT). AMA","Hello, Reddit! I am Dr. Warner Carr, the lead physician for our [Food Allergy Center](https://www.socalallergy.com/allergy-asthma-care/oral-immunotherapy) at Allergy and Asthma Associates of Southern California. We help our patients with food allergies by desensitizing them using a treatment called [oral immunotherapy (OIT)](https://www.oit101.org/listings/dr-warner-carr/). We are also one of the leading research sites for various food allergy treatments to a variety of foods. Here is a paper I was recently a part of: [AR101 Oral Immunotherapy for Peanut Allergy](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812856)

So, what is the deal with food allergies anyway? It’s so common now that you likely have a friend or even a family member with food allergies. In fact, an average of two kids in every classroom has a life-threatening food allergy. I’m here to clear up the misconceptions about food allergy, discuss current recommendations for food allergy, and answer any other questions in the field that you may have! For example, a common question we get is: what is the difference between food allergy and food sensitivities/intolerance? Food allergies have been controlling people’s lives. It’s time we take back that control.

I am a board-certified Allergy, Asthma, and Immunologist and would be happy to answer any questions about general allergies, asthma, and any other immunological conditions as well. I like to call allergy the “Rodney Dangerfield” of medical diseases because we “don’t get no respect.” Some countries don’t even have allergists. Let’s spread awareness about our specialty!

Of course, it results from an extra copy of the Y chromosome and it was caused by an error in sperm development.

I have inherited several physical and mental anomalies as a consequence, some unpleasant, most just curious. The most evident is that I am very tall at ~ 205 cm (6'9''). This condition is underdiagnosed and poorly understood so as far as I understand there's a lot of controversy over which symptoms are really linked to the illness and what their incidence is. I suddenly realised I had a match with enough of them to warrant pestering my doc for a karyotype analysis, and here we are.

I'd be happy to provide proof but I'm not sure what would constitute such... most I can do is a zoomed in pic of a line in the results docs if needed. I could also provide photographic proof of any physical symptom if requested, but as I anticipated by itself each singular symptom is not particularly impressive nor a smoking gun for double Y.

er2zdr,EvilBoobsKing,"I am developing controversial political games in Russia. Because of my last game, the Communist Party of Russia hunted me down, and I was forced into hiding, moving in with distant relatives.","Good afternoon, folks! My name is Georg, last time I did an AMA here,I talked about the challenges of creating a controversial adult game with some releigious overtones in Russia and all the threats that came from the opponents of such content, including religious fanatics and sex-negative conservaties.

And now, to balance it out, I was able to anger the Russian Communist Party by making another game. In essence, it’s a branching narrative game about a time traveler meeting with the Joseph Stalin himself. Through the course of the game, you can try to kill Stalin, change his worldview, and even seduce him and partake in some hot gay action with him (cue all the jokes about luxury gay space communism). There are 27 endings planned, each one with an exploration on how the world would look depending on the outcome of your conversation (and actions).

In May I announced the game, there was a slight surge of interest, but I just could not have imagined what would happen next. A small Polish gaming media learned about Sex with Stalin. The Poles generally do not like Stalin for obvious reasons, and they were delighted to see this game, One made by a Russian, to boot. It made some waves on the general european scenes, and ultimately attracted the attention of some of my compatriots who still worship the cult of the Great Leader. Tempers flared, and then even some of the largest Russian state-owned media outlets joined in on the action. At first, there were only a few disapproving nods, but then the host of a political talk show (imagine the very worst of your political commentary show, only with much more shouting) decided to devote a whole episode to the “Defilers of the Great History of the USSR”. Representatives of the Communist Party were also invited there. Of course, they could not appear indecisive. The Communists immediately convened a meeting and made a statement that the game should be immediately banned, and the authors punished by fine, or better yet, imprisoned. By making such game, in their opinion, I dishonor the history of our country and insult all the citizens of Russian. Their leader - Zyuganov, called me a Nazi collaborator. They also tracked down Stalin’s great-granddaughter, and talked her into writing a letter to Putin. Quite a few things in our country can be solved by writing a letter to Putin.

After this, all hell broke loose. Journalists besieged me - they constantly called me on my mobile phone (so much for privacy), drowned me in vaguely threatening mail, and even came to my hometown and showed the house where I live and all my neighbours’ houses on live TV. They showed my face, name, place of residence on a number of Russian political shows, and continued to discuss the game in major talk shows. In the evening, after seeing one such show, I decided to go out and get some air to clear the head. Some stranger came up to me, claiming that he knew me from somewhere. I tried to get away from him, but he followed me right to the very doorstep of my house. The very next day, someone threw some eggs at my house windows.
By this time I received so many threats that I started to simply ignore them. In the end, after reading a couple tens of messages about how I should be sent to the Gulag, be shot and maybe then quartered, it’s unlikely that I’ll learn anything new by reading another. I decided that I could no longer expose my family and neighbors to all this, and went into hiding. Some distant relatives living in a smaller town sheltered me for a while. Even then I could not sleep peacefully. It was reported that the Investigative Committee (our country-wide prosecution department) began a preliminary investigation, and there was a significant chance that they will go ahead with prosecution. In our country, only about 1% of all cases results in acquittal. You can imagine my dismay. Or maybe you can’t, but I was very dismayed.

I am fond of brewing Russian moonshine called Samogon. This is a pretty fascinating aspect of Russian culture dating back centuries, my grandfather and great-grandfather all did this. I like to drink samogon, too, but I always drank in moderation. But stress from all this happening got to me and I started to drink more, much more. I was incredibly lucky that my relatives who sheltered me supported me and did not allow me to drink myself to death . Then, and I could not believe my luck, it all passed. The media switched to other topics (new sanctions, the threat of war with Iran, etc.). The Investigative Committee either decided not to prosecute, or my case got buried in bureaucracy and there was no political pressure to pursue it anymore. Threats mostly stopped, too. I guess no one was this mad to actually travel to my neck of the woods. I mostly stopped drinking, got back home and returned to developing my games. I don’t know what awaits me in the future, but so far I am alive and free.

And apparently I just can’t lead a normal boring gamedev life, so I somehow got involved with Ukrainian developers making a game that makes fun of Russian security services. I guess I should prepare for a visit from the FSB (the russian analogue of the FBI). Hopefully, I won’t be shot and buried in one of Russia’s cold forests. In the meantime, AMA!

eqv6sw,pugDAD94,I lost my 95% of tongue due to cancer at age 23 AMA,"I’m writing this post with hope of spreading awareness to people so they listen to their bodies and not their doctors. On May 30th 2018 I was diagnosed with stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma and from that diagnosis I was told I was to have 95% of my tongue removed on the 27th of June and at the time I was not at all ready for what my life would become. 

The procedure went for 12 hours under general anesthetiser and spent a total of 15 days in the hospital. 7 in ICU and 8 in a general ward.

My time in the ICU was the worst time of my life as I was on strong painkillers, in an uncomfortable bed, couldn’t move, talk, I felt incredibly weak, and to top it all off sleep deprived as I was woken up every 15 minutes for the first 72 hours because they needed to ensure blood was flowing through the “flap”will describe shortly) and if it wasn’t the operation will have to be done again. Since I was unable to eat I was fed through a tube that went through my nose and down to my stomach and later on I had a procedure to place a feeding tube into my stomach (which is was incredibly annoying). To help me breathe I had a tracheotomy at the same time of my operation which is essentially a breathing tube in my neck and was very strange and took along time to heal. 

“The flap” is a section of flesh they cut out of my left leg that was made to fit into my mouth that would replace my tongue. This area of skin was attached to the remaining 5% of my tongue and sewn down from the left hand side to right hand side of my mouth (imagine if your couldn’t lift your tongue from the base of your mouth at all. 

Once the 72 hours were over the nurses were checking on the flap every hour for another few days. During this time I developed a fever and this caused I was able to leave the ICU once the fever subsided. The fever caused me to have mucus build up in my tracheotomy pipe and kept me awake most nights as it would suffocate me until I cleared it out either by coughing it out or having an nurse clear it out with a suction tube. I had my tracheotomy taken out as soon as I could breathe for 48 hours with a “cap” put on my tracheotomy. The cap allowed me to breathe out of my mouth think of a bottle cap. Once the tracheotomy was removed I had 48 more hours before I could go home and at this point I was counting down the hours desperate to go home. By this point I was willing to do anything possible to go home but this was nothing compared to what I was about to endure from the radiation therapy I had to have next.

The radiation therapy began once I had healed up from the surgery. At first it was okay and had no side effects however after day 7 I couldn’t eat or drink anything without it hurting really bad. Imagine the worst sore throat and if you also had razor blades and barbed wire in your throat and on top of that if someone was constantly punching your throat and was bruised. The only thing that would help was ice coffee and even that hurt. So I was constantly using my feeding tube to keep my caloric intake up and this caused me to lose a lot of weight. 

But yeah if I say anymore it would defeat the point so I just want people to take their Heath more seriously and if you think you have a problem, but your doctor won’t listen, go somewhere else for a 2nd if not 3rd opinion.",1,1579433252,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eqv6sw/i_lost_my_95_of_tongue_due_to_cancer_at_age_23_ama/,IAmA,1

eqd9pa,kkkensss,In high school I had a crazy obsessive boyfriend who tried to make my life a nightmare. After the break up strange things at night have been occurring. Ask me anything!,"Back when I was a junior in high school I started dating a guy, we dated up until a couple months into my senior year that was until I broke up with him. Throughout my entire relationship with him I never realized how controlling and manipulative he was to me. Looking back on some situations now I questioned why I ever talked to him. After 5 months of being broken up he still continues to harass me. It’s got so bad I’ve had to take it to the police. One incident that scared the crap out of me and still does  was over a span of 4 nights. The first night of the incident I was leaving the living room area of my house to go down to my room in the basement. After walking down the stairs I saw my storage room light on and door open (which was very unusual since now one ever goes in there) I approached the room and turned the light off and right when I shut the door I could hear my bedroom door around the corner slam shut. For anyone who knows me I always shut my room door after I leave and keep my lights off. I immediately sprinted upstairs to see my dad standing at the top of the stairs asking if I slammed my door which I replied with no I was no where near it. My dad then went down to my room and saw my door closed with all my lights on. Things in my dressers where thrown all across my floor in my room. My clothes in my closet were scattered and a glass vace my grandma gave me before she passed was shattered into little tiny pieces all over my carpet. He approached our walkout door from our basement only to see it unlocked and the wooden bar holding it from opening taken out. My heart sank. The next morning when I got to school I opened up my locker to see a little piece of paper folded that read “guess what I did last night.” Scared out of my mind I took it to the resource officer in my school who basically did nothing with it. My dad then ordered security cameras to put around the house. The next night it was exactly 1:02 am when a loud banging was heard on my window it lasted for about 5 minutes and I was completely frozen, I laid stuck in my bed. I didn’t think much of it and went back to bed. The following night at the same time the loud banging returned. Frightened I called my sister on FaceTime and she heard the whole thing. After that I showed my father videos of the banging and he told me to sleep upstairs. I didn’t listen. The next night same thing happened but this time it was louder and someone continued to ring our doorbell. Finally our cameras came in and my dad installed them as soon as he could and everything stopped. I still question wether or not this was him, I honestly wouldn’t put it past him. I have more bizarre stories if you’d like to hear them. It ranges from the rumors he told the entire school all the way up to his physical rampages he’d spring across from me. I also have stories of how he did the same shit to his ex before dating me. I’m willing to hear from others about there physical and mental abuse in relationships too as it’s a huge problem!!

eqagra,Miladgl16,What do you think of my body? Do you like me What do you think of my acceptance of my fatness?,"I am a 16 year old girl, weighing 240 lb (I know, it is quite a lot), and in a time of curiosity it occurred to me to want to ask what others thought directly from my body and from my thinking. I never had a lot of self-esteem, even though I was thin, but after the years went by, I went out with friends, other meals, penalties here, and being out of exercise, I reached adolescence with several more sizes, in where relatives and acquaintances made me feel very bad, as if I were someone else. My boyfriend who always insisted that I exercise, humiliated me and left me. Always being 14-15 years old I wondered if it was correct what the rest was saying, or what I thought, but I think I have made a right decision by accepting myself. I have accepted that perhaps, being chubby can be a problem, either to find clothes or to get mobilized and become fatigued, since my physical condition is very bad, but it is what I have accepted for loving myself, and the truth I detest the diets

and what do you think?

eq0310,scottkeyes,I'm Scott from Scott's Cheap Flights. Here to help your 2020 travel resolution &amp; answer all your flight questions for the next 12 hours! AMA,"Thanks to Reddit, I’ve been able to spend the past five years working my dream job: finding cheap flights.

This whole cheap flights adventure was born on Reddit back in [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3w3uvn/how_i_created_a_cheap_flights_email_list_and/). It grew from a hobby to a side-hustle to a full-time job to a company with more than 35 people. Hell, half my coworkers came via Reddit.

(If you're curious you can check out Scott's Cheap Flights [here](https://scottscheapflights.com/), but honestly zero pressure.)

So once a year, I like to take off “work” and devote a full day to fielding all the flight booking-related questions that Redditors have. No half-assed Woody Harrelson AMAs here; whole-ass only. Ask me *anything*.

One reason I love doing this: right now, we’re living in the Golden Age of Cheap Flights, yet so few people know it. It’s never been cheaper to travel overseas as it is today, yet polls show people think flights are getting more, not less, expensive. Part of my job is convincing people that travel is no longer just for the rich; it’s for all of us.

That’s why I get so thrilled when Redditors especially have cheap flight success stories, including:

* [u/junglebook03](https://www.reddit.com/user/junglebook03/)’s $500 roundtrip [honeymoon flights](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/apin5n/in_search_of_honeymoon_destination/egkpooz/?context=3) to Paris
* [u/turkeybone](https://www.reddit.com/user/turkeybone/) traveling internationally for the [first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/dlxx7l/lateblooming_solo_traveler/f4vc4xr/?context=3) at 37 and taking a dozen trips since
* (my personal favorite) [u/dickspace](https://www.reddit.com/user/dickspace/)’s [drunken purchase](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/b3pbg1/why_did_you_decide_to_visit_thailand/ej21fo1/?context=3) of a $389 roundtrip flight from LAX to Bangkok

I would be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we had some sadness this year ending service for folks who live outside the US, and I heard from a number of Redditors who were disappointed. It was an excruciating decision, made all the more difficult as a bootstrapped company (i.e. funded by members, not investors). Still sad, though I’m hoping it’s less a goodbye and more a see you later.

epzv41,commandry,Iama son of illegal immigrants who thinks Trump should buy the plane Mexico is selling as well of the rest of it's executive fleet so Mexico has enough money to build that wall.,"And as part of the deal Mexico builds the wall and pays for it themselves doing it mostly on their side of the border.
The wall can be partly built by Mexican cement company cemex providing a massive jump to their economy.

Large swaths of the wall can be a human wall of US field wardens and their tech backup who serve as a kind of mounted paramedic/park ranger in areas where physical walls are impractical. 

The panamerican border wall doubles as a national monument shared by both countries.
But the fleet of planes is used by Trump as part of his new personal army in case he gets impeached and loses access to air force one.

With the rest of the money Mexico can build hundreds of hospitals and medical centers as well as trade and grade schools with enough food pantries providing succor to people living or migrating through border towns and sanctuary cities.
Including US citizens who want to migrate to Mexico or simply travel to these border towns frequently.

eplsgj,RecallAwareness,"Hi, I'm Kevin Fitzgerald, a former Takata executive &amp; co-author of 'In Your Face, An Insider's Explosive Account of the Takata Airbag Scandal' - AMA","Hello everyone, this is Kevin Fitzgerald. I am a pyrotechnic engineer with over twenty years experience in the automotive airbag industry. In 2014, after nearly fifteen years with Takata, I resigned my position as VP of Inflator Engineering and Processing to testify for the U.S.Government. It was my information that led to the criminal charges against Takata, the indictment of three of its executives, and the vast expansion of the largest, most complex recall ever. 

24 people have been killed and hundreds maimed and injured by Takata's hand grenades exploding only feet from their face. Takata unleashed over 200 million of their moisture sensitive inflators into the word. 100 million of those have been recalled globally, with 70 million in the U.S, and after five years into the campaign, 25 million of that U.S population are still not fixed. 25 million!

The other 100 million Takata inflators have a drying agent. NHTSA was to decide on the 50 million of those in the U.S. by Dec 2019, but passed and all indications are that no action will be taken. A drying agent is only a Band-Aid. Takata's horrendous quality record will guarantee arrows slip through over time. 

I recently co-authored a book, In Your Face, about my time at Takata, at the center of the storm, trying my best to fight fraud and corruption. Ask me anything about my struggles there, life after whistle-blowing, the dismal pace of the current recall, General Motors' flat out refusal to participate, as well as the 100 million more still lurking out there.

epknsg,A-Mother,"IAMA mother who is in an incestuous relationship with my son. F 42, M 20.","So I got this idea of incest planted in my mind when I was younger by a friend of mine. Though I never wanted it to ever happen to me, I pretty much liked the idea and the taboo aspect related with it. Then I got married, had a son, and got divorced from my husband when my son was in his early teens. It was only when I lived with my son alone, I began noticing him. I noticed him turning into a man. I believe it was one of those first times when I saw him as a man, not as my own son.

After he turned 18, I began feeling inclination towards him. That old incest fetish had come back and it came back with rage. I could hardly control myself anymore and came to a conclusion that this is what I want. I wanted to have sexual relationship with my own son. So as adults do it, I sat down with him and talked with him about it.

I told him about what I’ve been feeling for the past some days, what I think of it and what I wanted from it. He was obviously taken aback from my confession. He asked me for some time to think about it. I was so glad that he didn’t considered it to be gross and thought of me as a bad woman, which I was pretty much feared of.

So on the third day before I head out for office, he came to my room and said that if I was really serious about what I had told him, then he is in. I just smiled and gave him a hug and my heart was pounding so fast. That evening, we had sex for the first time. Next day, fortunately, there wasn’t any sort of awkwardness or regret for either of us. Though he was a bit shy but that went away quickly.

So it has been almost a year since we’ve started off and we are still going strong. At present, neither of us is seeing anyone else. I don’t plan to take it forever and he knows it too. So, I am open to your questions so feel free to ask me all sorts of questions.",1,1579187861,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/epknsg/iama_mother_who_is_in_an_incestuous_relationship/,IAmA,1
epkk3d,orrfan,I’m a Florida journalist who found out sheriff's deputies have been inappropriately clearing some rape cases,"Hey, I’m Allison Ross of the *Tampa Bay Times*. I’ve been looking at how rape cases get [cleared without an arrest](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/01/05/how-the-pinellas-sheriffs-office-boosts-its-rape-stats-without-solving-cases/), following a [2018 investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/when-it-comes-to-rape-just-because-a-case-is-cleared-does-not-mean-solved) by ProPublica, Newsy and Reveal.

When police have enough evidence to make an arrest but can't for reasons outside of their control, they can use the ""exceptionally cleared"" category.

From 2014-2018, the Pinellas sheriff's office reported more than 750 rapes to the state and feds. It said it cleared 440 cases, but **only** **111 ended in arrest** — the rest were exceptionally cleared.

The agency said victims didn’t want to move forward. Experts say that isn’t unusual.

Looking at a random sample of those cases, I found some that were counted as cleared *before* authorities had investigated enough to make an arrest. Two experts reviewed a dozen files for the *Times*, and they found missed investigative opportunities and failures to meet best practices in handling sexual assault cases. For more, read the story [here](https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/01/05/how-the-pinellas-sheriffs-office-boosts-its-rape-stats-without-solving-cases/).

epclpe,mandrakeness,Advise to handle my annoying coworker,"I work for a bank and I’m a personal banker. I need advise on what would you do if you were in my situation. As a personal banker I help people at the desk and also help the teller whenever they need help. There was a recent change by the bank where the full time teller became a personal banker as well. ( bank is getting rid of tellers) It bothers me that he tells every customer that he has a desk and he keeps telling me all the sales he got for the day and how well he is doing. I’m happy for him and that he is having the opportunity to grow. On the other hand I feel bad for myself because I’m having to share sales and be more of a teller now that we don’t have a full time teller. I hate being rubbed on my face how well he is doing because it reminds me how bad I am feeling about the situation and the fact that I can no longer have full  potential for my sales. I’m limited now and feel like instead of growing my career im stagnating or even worse stepping back. Anyways, I don’t know if I’m being selfish or someone here can relate, but I’ve been wanting to tell my coworker to stop bragging about his sales. I like having success in silent and I would never tell someone how well I’m doing if I’m not sure my coworker did too. I don’t think my coworker does this on purpose but how would you convey the message that you are happy about them but you don’t want to hear about their sales? I don’t know if I should just suck it up because I’ll sound selfish or even jealous if I say so. I don’t want it to come off wrong. So I guess my question is should I say it or not? and if yes, how do I phrase it so I don’t sound like an ass?",1,1579140892,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/epclpe/advise_to_handle_my_annoying_coworker/,IAmA,1

eorapz,NicholasKristof,"We are Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, authors of TIGHTROPE: AMERICANS REACHING FOR HOPE. Ask Us Anything!","Hi Redditors. We are Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. Nick is a New York Times columnist and together we are co-authors of the book TIGHTROPE: AMERICANS REACHING FOR HOPE, on sale today. Our new book, which was excerpted in the [New York Times Opinion's Sunday Review](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/sunday/deaths-despair-poverty.html) addresses the crisis facing working-class Americans. For our reporting, we returned to Nick's hometown of Yamhill, Oregon, where about one-quarter of the children who rode the school bus with him are dead, mostly from drugs, suicide, alcohol or reckless accidents. In our book, we look at the causes of these ""deaths of despair,"" and what we can do to reverse this trend.

eo6v03,fiftysandwiches,"I traveled the country for 4 months in a van interviewing homeless people for my nonprofit project, Fifty Sandwiches- AMA!","Image: [https://imgur.com/DXb7zIb](https://imgur.com/DXb7zIb)

So, after graduated college, I ran with an idea I had in high school, where I would travel the country trading lunches for interviews with homeless people throughout the US to put their stories and experiences into a book called Fifty Sandwiches.

 After funding a Kickstarter in 2016, I began planning the trip, and a few months later took off on my solo journey in my $1200 van named Milo from my home base in Coeur d'Alene, ID. I taught myself photography throughout the trip and nervously began approaching people on the street and in shelters, in hopes of getting a 'collective face to homelessness'.

It took about 5 interviews in Portland for me to realize my mission was impossible, as I'd have to interview 500,000+ people to get an honest look at the homeless experience. I soon decided the mission of the project would be to capture the diversity and subsequent complexities of the homeless population, in hopes of showing that there is more to homelessness than being homeless. 

 Without a budget, an agent, editor, designer, etc, I had to learn a whole new set of 'skills' to finally push this thing out 3 YEARS after the trip was completed. I work full time, so I could only work on the book on weeknights and weekends. The amount of work was far beyond anything I could have ever predicted, and I still have a LONG way to go. But hey, I signed up for this, and few things worth doing are easy, it's my creation and I might as well complete it to the best of my abilities. 

Thanks for reading and PLEASE bother me with any questions, concerns, or insults. I am all ears:)

Ask me anything about how we made the 52 Places to Go in 2020 list, about being a Travel editor, or anything else.","Hi Reddit! I’m Amy Virshup, the travel editor for The New York Times. Last week, we published [52 Places to Go in 2020](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/travel/places-to-visit.html), our annual list of destinations around the world that should be on your list now.

I’m here to answer your questions about [how the list came together](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/travel/top-destinations-52-places.html), what it’s like being a travel editor, how the Travel section is navigating the problem of climate change, and more. 

A little about me: Most recently I was a deputy editor on the Metro desk, overseeing immigration and education coverage. I was also on the Culture desk, first as the Books editor and then as deputy editor. I’ve traveled everywhere from Cape Town to Copenhagen, while rarely staying in a hotel.

I'm a multi-millionaire (not that that defines me) who grew up poor, but made my way through hard work and a series of (apparently) well-calculated decisions. Start 30's now. 

In contrast to those who grew up rich, we didn't have much growing up, for which I tend to think I have a different perspective. I also tend to think those who excel in some aspect of life (be it wealth, sports, music, happiness, etc.) often have different and interesting takes on things.

eo33p9,cmerandi2,Chronic pain patients unable to access pain medication in an effort to cure the opioid crisis. Suicide list continues to grow.,"I am the founder of the national Don't Punish Pain Rally organization. I organize rallies for pain patients who can no longer access pain medication, doctors who have been targeted by governmental agencies.

Millions of patients have been left to suffer because doctors are fearful to prescribe. I'm routinely called in to advocate for people with advanced stage cancer who's oncologist will no longer prescribe. While overdosing is at an all-time high, prescribing is at an all-time low.

if you're fortunate to find a doctor who will prescribe, chances are you will encounter problems at your pharmacy because your pharmacist has also been targeted by the DEA. Should your pharmacist fill your script, I can assure you your insurance carrier will present difficulties if your filling greater than 60 morphine equivalent.

I have innocent doctors in prison whose only crime was treating their patients. Doctors simply are not willing to put their life on the line when treating one's pain. 

When will this madness end? I predict three years. Sadly, the suicide list will continue to grow in the interim

When legislators practice medicine, bad things happen. Bad things are happening",2,1578916246,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/eo33p9/chronic_pain_patients_unable_to_access_pain/,IAmA,1

enr8d6,j_mitso,Let’s talk about anxiety. I’m a professional life coach who specializes in working with anxious and insecure college students who feel like they’re chronically “not enough.” AMAA!,"I received my professional certification from Duquesne University and have been working as a coach for the past 6+ years. I founded [CalmCampus](http://calmcampus.org/), a company which provides remote coaching to college students and, hopefully, will one day augment college counseling offices. I have this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamesstamatelos_doing-a-live-ama-on-reddit-ask-me-almost-activity-6622193114834616320-rQDK) as my verification. I’ve also written a few articles on this subject,[including this one which covered a 30 year study demonstrating skyrocketing levels of perfectionism](https://medium.com/the-mission/generation-insecure-27-years-of-research-on-the-battle-to-be-enough-ec51a2fd00c6) among college students in the US, UK, and Canada. 

I believe that most articles about rising anxiety rates are missing the point. My work hasn’t shown anxiety itself to be the problem but rather the symptom of a problem. The core issue relates to self-worth and social belonging. Research has shown that when we’re presented with a standard and fail to live up to it, anxiety is an immediate result. I believe that we are experiencing this on a mass level. 

This fear causes many of us to try to become ‘enough’ through external achievement. Many of us will insult and ridicule ourselves in order to stay motivated and achieve our goals. We chase mountaintop after mountaintop, thinking that “this is going to be the one that fixes me,” but it never does. At that point we often assume that we chose the wrong goal instead of realizing that the strategy itself is flawed. Internal problems require internal solutions. We have to go within. 

I know this battle personally. It’s part of why I chose to focus on this field. I also know, both from personal and professional experience, that a lot of the common therapies and tactics used out there today don’t seem to be especially effective in helping people address this problem. I’m writing a book with a working title of “Enough” that seeks to fill this knowledge gap. I’m working with an editor now and will be submitting it to publishers soon, so hopefully that won’t be too far away.

I’ll be around most of today to answer questions off and on. AMAA!",380,1578853939,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/enr8d6/lets_talk_about_anxiety_im_a_professional_life/,IAmA,1

enpsfl,VinegaDoppio,"I grew up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates as a third-generation expat (yes, expat) and will be moving to the US (by myself) now at the age of 18.","It's quite crazy to imagine that after 3 generations, someone would still be considered an ""expat"" but it is the reality in the UAE. The difference between an expat and an immigrant is generally that an immigrant intends to assimilate fully into the culture of their new country, but is furthermore accepted by that new country and usually given citizenship. My grandpa moved here in the 60s from south India, my dad was born here in the 70s, and I was born in the early 2000s.

It's impossible to gain citizenship in the UAE unless you are the offspring of an ethnic Emirati male - even if you wed an Emirati, you are still not given a full citizenship which would entail you to the same rights as an ethnic Emirati. This is done to protect the population from outside influence, as ethnic Emiratis only make up 11% of the population of the UAE, the rest all being expats. And indeed, Emiratis are treated well with free housing, free education, and GOVERNMENT FUNDED vacations, in many cases - not to mention cushy jobs. This country really tends to prioritize leisure over work, quite like Europe, which will often surprise the work-obsessed North American or East Asian expats here. Almost all Emiratis are employed by the government (which pays very well here, but only takes Emiratis) and many are unfit for their jobs in my opinion as there is little motivation to study or achieve if you know that your [wasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasta) will get you a job anyways.

My parents tried to move to the US a few times, but eventually had to move back before achieving citizenship due to needing to take care of my family here. I was born in the US and am consequently American, but I moved to Dubai at the age of 2. 

I got accepted into a university in Massachusetts a few weeks ago, and will be attending there. After that, I intend to reside in the US for the rest of my life. It's a simple matter of the US having better opportunities and a better economy than the UAE, as well as me simply wanting to get away from my stagnant life here.

enlblb,Maryishnu,The horrors of Amazon.com customer service based in INDIA [A Reproducible Study],"**I  am a new user so kindly let me know which subreddit is more suitable to  post this if not here and I will happily move it there, with thanks.**

**Abstract:**  You are likely to laugh and cry simultaneously reading this post, so if  being caught off guard looking weird worries you then take a cover and  continue reading, otherwise the TLDR version is your friend:

**TLDR:** It is so bad to the point of being a health risk. It is guaranteed **\***  \[as an amazon rep would put it\] to still your anger and frustration  even if you happen to be a psychopath and you will want to, perhaps for  the first time in your life, to go and hug a priest whilst sobbing and  drooling. Plus, if you notice Autistic symptoms hitting you after a  round of amazon Indian customer service, don't freak out, you've just  been served.

You can now safely skip to **\[how to reproduce\]** section.

**\***  Guaranteed, at once, rest assured, be assured, and \[the same\] \*\* are  some of Amazons reps favorite although sometimes auto generated  vocabulary. Of course and you guessed it, talking about things that  never happen. The irony \[TM\].

**\*\*** \[The same\] is some weird indian way of saying \[that\] or \[it\], and I had to learn \[the same\] the hard Amazon way.

Example:

Me: The order I made can be found by following this link: [www.alinktothefuckingorder.com](https://www.alinktothefuckingorder.com/)

Rep: I have checked the same but could not find your order.

Me: Who is \[the same\]?

**Introduction:**

Amazon by definition is a company aimed for maximizing profit. Not bad, right? But wait, there is a catch, or perhaps two.

To  help with cutting cost, milking and generating more money with minimal  financial and moral obligations Amazon has shifted its entire customer  service chat to India.

And what is  Indian Customer Service infamous for? Horrendous quality. It has even  been depicted in movies where a person sitting in sweet home Alabama  reaching for help only to be answered by an Indian talking to him about  the weather in the State meanwhile cheating from an american weather  forecast report in front of them or on a screen made to help them sound  local.

Whole documentaries were  made detailing how customer service businesses in India have been made  for that purpose, so perhaps you could watch one for more in depth  analysis of SHIT.

Hell, indians  even invented \[turn off your router and turn it back on again\] \[TM\]  troubleshooting smoking gun argument that is plaguing ISPs globally  today, the shit ones who dont know any better that is.

One  more thing. When money is the major drive for an organization such as  Amazon while other things are marginalized, why hire americans who cost  on minimum wage what a dozen of indians would have?

Hiring  americans in an american company who have constitutional rights, can  easily sue them for violations and cost hell a lot more sounds like a  really bad dream for Amazon.

This  is where the indians come in. Cheap labor, shit quality, cheap labor,  did I say cheap labor? Then the hell with quality, specifically when it  comes to customer service.

Hiring them factually costs less than installing answering machines for serving the entire customer base of Amazon Corporation.

And  if you are familiar with indian business models and work environments  in india you would know for a fact that orders supersede contradictory  logic of any kind even the kind of logic obvious to a fairly educated  seven year old. \[The Boss is Vishnu, or an additional god\] replaces the  cliche slogan \[the customer is always right\]. If you happen to be a  customer in trouble in india, ALWAYS reach from the top and watch  rubbish you have just been told moments ago vanish into smithereens and  the laws of nature and common sense release itself from suspension mode.

So  overall, cheap, obedient unquestioning labor to the point of self  objectification and best of all minimal worker rights in case of the  unlikely event of complaints sounds to amazon like a winner.

What is the result? More money and a circus.

**Prerequisite knowledge:**

P1:  Amazon drives customer service employees to finish support  conversations as fast as possible, so the more cases closed for a rep  the better it looks in his stats even if those cases are not \[actually\]  resolved. Does Will smith in pursuit of happiness answering calls come  to mind? No, its actually Dumb and Dumber.

In  the indian version of Amazon support this translates to using switch  board automated messages where reps can click on sentences to answer  customers even if those sentences are nonsensical in context.

If  you dont know what they are, switch boards are usually used in prank  calls where the prankster for example clicks on a sentence in a batman's  voice to play it to the recipient.

This means two things:

1-  The requirement for having functioning english to handle anything more  than benign tasks manually is barely required, thus they train them to  rely more on clicking sentences to say something to you. If anything  above that is required, they fall apart which means it is not even  considered when they get interviewed for the job.

2-  This also means that the ones with decent quality of english would  rather better opportunities and the ones that settle for less and have a  few licks of english come to Amazon and try to become switch board  masters.

P2: Amazon customer service chat comes in three tiers:

Tier 1 - Representatives \[the ones you start with\]

Tier 2 - Specialists \[nothing like the name\]

Tier 3 - Leadership team members \[if you manage to reach that far\]

What  happens when you come with a problem that requires an IQ above 35 to  solve and Tier 1 rep \[Prakash\] frustrates you with non-sense but you  manage to keep the conversation long enough and they don't hang up on  you, they will finally give up and pass you to a so called specialist.

If  you fail or lets say idle for 2 min after wasting half an hour of your  life they are given the right to hang up on you after leaving clickable  sentence to bid you farewell.

Then  you will be automatically connected to the next rep \[Pradeep\] who will  click you the auto sentence: \[give me a few moments please to read the  previous correspondence\] and when they're finally back they will ask you  what the problem is, which you will have to explain again.

Now  say you got finally escalated to a specialist and if this specialist  doesn't have enough access to solve the issue or is non the better from  the rep or reps before they will pass you on to a \[Leader\].

If  you did reach to a \[Leader\] I think you are one of those people who  achieved Nirvana IRL. Still, the issue might not be solved after you've  explained to the Leader what happened to you when you got gang banged by  Prakash, Pradeep and the specialist.

This  three Tier circle of hell is a case where stupidity have a marvelous  side affect for Amazon's favor. Very few people would want to waste  their time to reach all the way up, which means more \[closed\] cases for  the reps. WIN WIN.

**How to reproduce** \[not to be confused with making babies, I mean recreating an Amazon customer service hell hole experience\]

This  part gives sure-fire steps of testing the absolute madness of going  through Amazon customer service, and for purposes of this experiment,  the chat service on Amazon's contact us is being used.

Make  sure you have your patience, your neighbor's patience and your pills  handy in case you are prone to or have heart trouble, blood pressure,  anxiety, and finally dare I say: do this at your own risk. This is no  joke.

Please note that we are  trying to create a case that is intentionally designed to use a brain to  solve and harder than it to be auto-answered. You can be creative and  use your own case. What is bellow is just an example.

Here we go:

A.  Protip: read prerequisite knowledge section if you haven't. If you are  familiar with what amazon customer service is like, then proceed;

B. Create two [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) accounts \[Account1 and Account2\] and have all the details handy.

C. Login to one of these accounts, say Account1.

D. Open the main [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/)  page and click on left side corner menu then click on \[Help\]. Scroll  down till you can see \[Need More Help\] last choice the left menu and  click that, then choose \[Contact us\] in the middle of the screen. It  will ask you to login if you arent and might do even if you are already,  do so then on the next screen choose \[prime or something else\] box,  then scroll down to find two drop down menues, in the first choose  \[login and security\] and in the second \[close account\]. Contact options  will appear, click on \[chat\].

This process alone is fuck trip. If lost google instructions to chat to amazon support.

E.  Tell the rep you want to delete Account 2 but you don't have access to  the email registered on it and therefore you can login only as far as  being asked for an OTP number that you need to have by accessing email  to be able to successfully pass login step 2 \[which by the way you cant  reach to if you don't have the password\]. They might ask you what is the  name on the account, tell them you don't know for whatever reason but  that you have every single detail including the password for the account  you wish to delete except the name. They might offer you a number to  call, tell them that you want them to handle it and with any excuse for  not being able to use a phone.

F.  Watch them crumble. Remember, don't use profanity no matter how much you  are tempted to and try to intentionally prolong the conversation to  reach to the Tiers above that they might transfer you to.

G. Repeat till you're satisfied with the results.

Conclusion:  This can function as an open challenge for Amazon to produce 3  consecutive chats that didn't result with an embarrassing terrible  horrible shitshow.

People: You can literally use any scenario of your own making with a similar level to reach \[the same\] \[sec\].",4,1578819708,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/enlblb/the_horrors_of_amazoncom_customer_service_based/,IAmA,1

 My hut burned down after I left a fire untended in it. I needed a new one quickly. Fortunately, [I had already cleared a new spot earlier in the wet season for such a purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vUnrnHpWg). I constructed the new hut from wood and palm thatch. It was 3 x 3m in floor plan and a total of 3m high with 1.5m high sidewalls. 4 posts were put into the ground and a pyramidal roof was built on top of this. The frame was then thatched with palm fronds (which are less flammable than grass thatch but don't tend to last as long in wet weather). After finishing the hut I collected the possessions from the last hut and moved them into the new one. Yams from the garden were dug up but there weren't many due to the soil being compacted and low in organic matter. A yam was cooked by wrapping it in clay and baking it in the hot coals for 30 minutes. Now I have a larger hut where I can continue to make projects despite the minor set back that has just occurred.",7,1578808540,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/enjrbe/primitive_technology/,IAmA,1

enh1sx,lidiakwon,"I’m a Korean female dating coach, helping men from all over the world to destroy loneliness, get undefeatable confidence and win a girlfriend. AMA","Hi, I'm Lidia and I’m a dating coach.

&lt;Video version and intro of me&gt;  [https://youtu.be/MnP6R8ZUy\_c](https://youtu.be/MnP6R8ZUy_c)

My coaching partner and I run a year long transformational membership group that helps our clients to shake up their relationship and dating life.

Our goal isn't just to help men get a date. It's to help men totally master relationships in life (romantic relationships being our starting point), and to make those relationships healthy and long lasting.

We have a collective 30 years of experience in dating and relationship work, we have given workshops, helped clients to work on their lives and have developed our own relationship coaching model that we now use to coach our clients.

What I’m repeatedly told from new clients is that they are feeling lost, confused and often overwhelmed with information and advice they’re getting online.

When dating, we see that they are playing power games, having communication issues, and struggling to express their feelings in an effective way.

The women they talk to and meet on dates often reject or ghost them, and don't tell them why.

Lack of non-judgmental and direct feedback from women is something that I believe is holding men back from better success on their dates (or even getting dates).

So. I will give you that feedback in this AMA over the next 12-24 hours. (I’m currently in the UK, so might be slow to reply initially due to the time difference.)

**Ask me anything about dating and relationships :)**

Leave your question below in the comment and I will reply as best as I can.

I have been keeping snakes since I was nine years old, even taking one to school in 4th grade for show and tell.

Now, 17 years later, my collection has grown to include some very dangerous snakes, including mambas and spitting cobras.

Their living space takes up almost half of my house, and my wife has accepted that.

en7fga,missile_201,"I am a citizen of India. Althogh its not a superpower, my country is the eminent power of South Asia. A south asian country, that everyone knows of but is greatly misunderstood by all outside South Asia. I want to clear all misconceptions that you may have about India. AMA!","Being on the internet for a while has taught me that there exist infinite misconceptions and stereotypes about all countries, which are understandable. Hence I also came across multiple r3curring misconeptions about India that most foreigners, typically westeners tend to have about India. I am making this post to help clear some of them up.
I invite all of you to ask anything you may like about my country, ask me to validate any stereotypes you may have heard about Indians and give your own views/regional views about India
I think I should start off by clearing some misconceptions the majority of foreigners have:

1. We are not a Hindu country. We are a fully secular nation. Muslims make up ~20% of our population and we have a significant Christian population as well. We have significant populations of every other major religion in the world as well (Sikhism, Buddism, Jainsim, Zoroastrianism, and Jewism).
Yes, I am fully aware of the controversy created by the Citizenship Amendment Act that ""discriminates"" against Muslims on some level, but I am not here to talk about politics. You either love the act or hate it, but I'm not here to take sides.

2. Hindus and Muslims tend to live together peacefully, bar some occasional riots and disputes. The biggest instance of Hindu-Muslim violence was caused by the Partition of British India into India and Pakistan. Since then, all instances of violence have been significantly more sparce and less destructive.

3. Most people all over the world know about the caste system. Anyone who agrees with the caste system is delusional. It is EVIL. It discriminates against certain people on the basis of birth, which is a form it evolved into over centuries. For centuries the people it discriminates against have suffered for no reason. Our constitution has BANNED the practice of discrimination based on caste, althogh not the system.
What most outsiders don't know about it is that it is not something that runs the country. Noone in a fully urban environment practices caste-based discrimination. It is simply impossible to do so. Me and almost everyone I know grew up in a city, and we don't even know our own caste. I have visited almost all of India during my life. I think I cam safely tell you caste is steadily disappearing from rural areas as well. It is only in the most backward, smallest and remote villages that caste-based discrimination exists fully. Even the supposed ""low-caste"" people themselves are brainwashed into believing that they are the scum of the Earth.
Overall, caste-based discrimination is an evil practice that was rampant in all parts of India, but has disappeared from almost all urban and even rural environments today. In 2020, only the most backward and remote villages practice it.

4. People think we don't have good relations with China/we hate each other. Yes, there are several instances of border-based skirmishes over 7 decades and yes, we fought a war in 1962. Yes, we have a large amount of area that is disputed.
But we don't hate each other. India and China are large trading partners. We have maintained cordial bilateral relations for a long time. India and China will never be friends, but we can be cordial neighbours.
Also, about the disputed territory, most of the Kashmir territory claimed by China is administered by them. Aksai Chin, as it is called, belongs to China.
The state of Arunanchal Pradesh is a different story. Most of the territory, if not all, is under Indian administration. I have even been to the town of Tawang in the north of the state once. There are free and fair democratic elections there, hosted by India.

This about wraps up what I have always wanted to get off my chest. As I stated before, I would be more than happy to answer any questions you all may have. I am also eager to hear your views on India",1,1578749466,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/en7fga/i_am_a_citizen_of_india_althogh_its_not_a/,IAmA,1

I learned how to play the guitar and piano, around which time I was introduced to Hip-Hop and started listening to Eminem, Nas, Biggie, Big L, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and more. Influenced by all these different genres, I started making music when I was around 18, and now we’re going on a tour around the country end of March and stopping in texas for the SXSW festival.

emubn8,Outkastt_,F (18) I've attempted to be in multiple esports pro scenes AMA,"I've been professionally gaming for as long as I can remember, I started well ""Attempted"" to become pro in some of the old cod's back in the 2000's, Ranging from mw2 cod2 being the main ones I attempted. Next being Halo 3 and Overwatch. Sadly never made it far in those scenes due to the title. I only really started to make a difference when it came to Paladins (Free budget version of Overwatch) and Splitgate (Free budget version of Halo/Portal)

I was, for a short while really hard working on the games I was playing. I spent hours upon hours researching on how to get better, putting blood sweat and tears into training mechanically and game sense wise both in game or in aim trainers (as I played mostly FPS) and took multiple coaching lessons from pros from each individual game to help improve.  


Sadly, most scenes don't treat female players evenly we get called multiple names and get neglected from teams due to our gender (Not all males, but most) some scenes being worse than others. This caused me to overwork myself to prove people wrong, but sadly it all came down on me and I suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts...  


I now work full time as a kitchen Porter and housekeeper at a hotel, have any questions about what it's like to be in esports? how I got through it? any advice you want?

&amp;#x200B;

I watched a public television show with respectable figures and followed their instructions to create an account at  [https://www.investous.com/eu](https://www.investous.com/eu/deposits/). It is full of bureaucracy and it is complicated, but what stood up was the fact that we had to invest 250,00€ to start trading, and we could ""withdraw the ammount at any time"". I soon realized that I do not understand anything related to this platform, it was way too complicated for me to understand. So I decided to withdraw the money and it all seemed ok. I was expecting to be charged on a fee, but no more than 5% I thought. They charged me 80 EUR for withdrawing the money before completing at least two trades. I was at shock, not because I will be missing the ammount, but because this conditions are located in a page with hundreds of pages of info and conditions, and they make sure you don't get there before you've made your deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what I need to know is: how can I charge the platform and make sure justice is made? Or, at least, how can I force them to make this information clear during the signing in, so that people in the future won't be tricked as I was?

em3sw4,let_creed_scuba,I am a SEX WORKER and a YOGA TEACHER who believes the two go hand-in-hand. Ask me anything!,"Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/dSu2Z1f](https://imgur.com/a/dSu2Z1f)

Where to begin? I’ve been doing sex work and teaching yoga for a while now. I am a 500 hour Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT). I consider myself an avid story-teller. I also love to hitch-hike and I’m planning a backpacking through-hike in the spring. But here is my story about the first two: 

I started stripping in 2018. Not because I forced into it, but I chose to do it. I had recently taken a break from college and had always been curious. You know how college girls all joke, “I’ll just drop out and become a stripper.” Well, that was me. I was scared and had no clue what to expect. People have a tendency to think that sex work is inherently dirty and immoral. But doing it has completely changed my perspective and outlook on life for the better. This was around the time I started teaching yoga. I continued stripping throughout the year and a half of Yoga Teacher Trainings I went through. I try to put the yoga into sex work at any chance I get. I have stories and experiences that are so beautiful that remind me every day why I do what I do, without shame. I honestly used to hate men before I started stripping. Yes, men are rather silly sometimes and it does amaze me my influence I can have on them (I call it my “Inner Sex Goddess”). I used to view men through lenses of toxic masculinity, but as a sex worker, I’ve found that the same men who are outwardly super macho are often craving a softer side of life. They’re expected to “act like a man” all the time, and that mindset it so toxic to men and boys. As a sex worker (and a yoga teacher) I get to see a really vulnerable side of men that they hide from even their closest of friends. I had a customer who was making “jokes” about being suicidal and I had to realize they weren’t jokes. I couldn’t give him much, but I could give him my friendship, someone to talk to, someone to be vulnerable with when the outside world is a harsh place to be. I have men with fetishes that they have to hide from their wives and girlfriends because of fear of being shunned, but as a sex worker, I have the joy of being able to hold space for their desires and breathe their fantacies to life (at least within the scope of what’s acceptable within a strip club). 

I recently led a workshop at the yoga studio I teach at called “Releasing Your Inner Sex Goddess,” in which I worked with women to help open the sacral chakra and let sexual energy flow through freeform movement (and yes, some sexy stripper moves, too!) as well as mantra repetition. Women in the yoga studio have sought me out because of my sex work because they have a dry marriage or want to tap back into their sexuality. I, too, used to be very sexually repressed. The world of sex work is a whole different world! I used to be nervous about dropping my towel while changing in a locker room, almost ashamed of my own body. Now, I love being naked and have “come home” to my own body, and I strive to help others do the same. As sex workers, we don’t judge. We recognize the beauty in all bodies. As a yoga teacher, I preach that yoga isn’t about what your body looks like doing the pose, but rather the sensations you receive from doing it. That’s why people come to us. As both a yoga teacher and a sex worker, it is my job to hold space for a student or client to experience a moment. 

Now, for the stories! I have many interesting, funny, beautiful stories. Ask me anything about stripping or yoga or anything else and I’ll do my best to answer! Thanks for reading!",76,1578540007,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/em3sw4/i_am_a_sex_worker_and_a_yoga_teacher_who_believes/,IAmA,1

elv6qa,theparkpoet,"3 years ago I quit my job &amp; started writing poems for strangers in public parks. I've written ~10,000 poems. This past year I started staging ""interventions"" with the pick-up artists who were running rampant in the park. Ask me anything!","Hellooo. So, for the past \~3 years (I started March 2017) I've been living entirely off of writing poems.

I sit out with a table and a sign, usually in Washington Square Park in NYC, and I write poems for every person that asks for one. Usually people give me money! Sometimes they don't!

I live off a combination of: 1) donations from strangers, 2) [online book sales](https://www.theparkpoet.com/store), &amp; 3) my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/peterchinman).

You can check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theparkpoet/) to see photos and poems. You can also google me (Peter Chinman) for some interviews. 

Last year I began to notice how many pick-up artists were in the park. There so many of them who were there almost every day, spending hours targeting women. I started calling them out, and then staging ""interventions"" when they would make approaches. I've had a few testy run-ins with some of the ""dating coaches"" who lead pick-up artist classes. I've been threatened (and attempted to be seduced). But the interventions work! The pick-up artists started avoiding the section of the park I was in and would complain about me in their private telegram chat.

elmtye,bjscastle,IAMA Person Born With Backwards Legs. AMA.,"I posted this on AMA and it was suggested I post here as well so I thought I'd do so. 

I was born with a rare genetic mutation that caused my legs to be born completely on backwards. My dad is the only other person I know that has this mutation, no one in our family beyond him has it. There's records of the knees and ankles being born on backwards but I have yet to find something about the entire leg. I had a surgery when I was 11 weeks old to reverse the mutation and they are on the right way now however I do have scars that run from my hip to my knee on both legs.

I am a 23 year old female and am handicapped but do not look handicapped which can be very frustrating. I can't walk for long distances or stand for extended periods of time. I have to use a wheelchair when I go on vacation which can be really annoying with the looks I get as from all other outward appearances I look like a normal girl my age. I also have a handicapped parking sticker. 

I've attached photos of me as a baby. One is of me with my leg casts that I wore as a baby after my surgery and one of me before the surgery was done. I've also added a photo of one of my scars (they are identical and with how far they go up there wouldn't be an appropriate way to photograph the entire thing).

I have spent the past few decades trying to answer one very big question: What happens when the Americans get tired of maintaining the international system, pack up and head home? That work led me to assemble my new book, Disunited Nations: The Scramble for Power in an Ungoverned World. I'm here to answer your questions. 

So AMA about my work in geopolitics. There is no corner of the world – geographically or economically – that I’ve not done at least some work. So bring it on: India, Russia, Argentina, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Sweden, Thailand, demographics, nuclear weapons, hypersonics, hacking, drones, oil, solar, banking, assembly lines, dairy, pickles (seriously, I’ve given a presentation on pickles) and on and on. I do about 100 presentations a year, and every presentation forces me to relearn the world from a new point of view so that I can then help my audience see what is in their future.

However, there are a few things I do not do. I don't pick sides in political squabbles or make policy recommendations or recommend stock picks. I provide context. I play forward the outcomes of choices. I help people, companies and governing institutions make informed decisions. What is done with that is up to the audience. Right now, that’s you.

That said, I would love for someone to stump me today – it’s how I get better. =]

ele0c9,reheight,I am a a self taught programmer still in high school and I have even released apps on the iOS App Store. AMA,"Hey I am Dustin, and I am a Junior in high school. I am like any other average high school student you would expect to see. I live in a more secluded area and growing up I found the most enjoyment from technology because I never had any friends live near me. I gained interest in computers, how they work, and what makes them do all the *magic* we see when we click buttons and press keys on a keyboard. So here is my story of growing up around technology and taking interest in it at a young age (~8 years old).

__The Beginning__
So when I was younger I was like any other kid, I loved playing video games, in fact they were a key part of my life and they helped me forget and get through a lot of stressful times that happened in my life. The problem was that I could never play anything that great because I was using a Windows XP desktop that could barely run Wizard 101, and so I started to take interest in learning how computers work (hardware wise) and I started to do my research about what I should do to build a computer that would suite my needs and fulfill my desires. I quickly realized that computers are a wonderland, it’s not just a one-size-fits-all, you have many choices to choose from when building a computer. I had really loved what I was learning.

I found a game that is wildly popular or was while I played it called Roblox, and I remember there was a game mode that would allow you to create scripts, and some users would create special weapons and others would just create downright sexual and inappropriate scripts but what did I expect, the game was played by teenagers and children. I had loved the idea of being able to control the code or at least use a form of script that would be executed by the server and I loved the idea that I could make it do WHATEVER my 9 year old heart desired.

__The Advancement__
So a few years pass, maybe 2 years I would say is safe to assume and my computer had broke, I had ended up trying to replace my CPU had been broken because I wasn’t careful and I didn’t realize that there are socket types at the time. I had just gotten a new laptop though and for some reason I was so interested in websites, at the time all I knew was that you could easily code a little simple website in Notepad without a problem so my curious mind opened up notepad, but where would I start? So I opened my browser and went straight to YouTube and typed in “how to create a website easy”, and my eyes lit up seeing all these results. I clicked on a few and got confused pretty quickly but one of them caught my eye, it was a website that you could use the `&lt;embed&gt;` tag in HTML to add games like angry birds, happy wheels, etc. to my website so my little excited self copied everything this man had told me to and after maybe 1-2 hours I was finished. My own little video game site! I couldn’t believe it! I could finally play the games on my school computers since they blocked other sites! Now that’s as exciting as I got because once I got to the school I realized that the embed tag only retrieved information from another server, and since HTML is client side then the school network solution (Cisco Meraki) had still been able to stop my curious mind dead in its tracks. Still even then I didn’t know how to copy any files to my server or anything because my little mind only knew how to copy the man and what he told me, I barely even knew what HTML stood for (Hypertext Markup Language), and I didn’t really know what I was doing on my own.

__The “Hacker” Phase__
This is around the time where I was maybe only a sixth grader and was in middle school, this was around the time where Lizard Squad has been attacking Sony, and my mind was blown, I mean SONY?? A company that is huge and worth millions, had been taken down by group SIGNIFICANTLY smaller than them, or so I thought. I quickly googled ‘DDOS’ and of course I saw tons of articles about Lizard Squad and Anonymous, and then finally learned about DDOS and it’s predecessor DOS, I was enticed. I knew how DDOS worked now and realized that since they had controlled probably hundreds of thousands of computers they infected that the attack was nowhere near as small as just 6-7 guys on a computer but instead it was 6-7 guys most likely purchasing botnets or using a web service designed for DDOS. I then went into a phase where I purchased a package from a website called ddos.city (I’m only saying this because they shut down), I mean now I had all this power and didn’t know what to do... so what did I do?? I knew EXACTLY what I was going to do... I went to my schools website and sweet it loaded just fine, and then went to the tab with the DDOS service and types in my schools domain and hit run, then went back to my schools page and to my surprise there was no response, besides their server serving me a error page. I did this maybe 2 times and to cover my ass I told my school about it explained to them how it worked, told them it is safer if they use a CDN, and distributed loads, and told them about AWS and Cloudflare and then the problem was solved. I mean sure if you had their original IP address then you could still very much take their site down but hey it worked and that is all that matters. Since then I never worked in any field that had to do with hacking and never tried, far as I’m concerned, I never truly hacked and I was using a preloaded and GUI controlled script.

__The “Spiderweb”__
I call this the ‘spiderweb’ because this is the part where I finally decide to truly learn how to program and take it seriously. I remember I was maybe 11-12 years old and I was on google searching and found tons of sites for “learn to code in 15 minutes!”, but I wasn’t dumb and I knew that coding took years and even decades to perfect so I tried to avoid them. One that caught my eye was Codecademy, and I started learning HTML but I didn’t get it so I jumped to Java, and I was off, running full speed at the language which was the highest paying at the time and unknown to me also one of the most complex and difficult languages to learn as a first programming language, I mean usually it’s safe to start with Python, JavaScript, etc. I still got the hang of it but what was I possibly going to do with Java? Oh I knew! I was going to make a Minecraft server plugin using Bukkit API! I was off to the races, my little heart was fulfilled, I thought I had beat the game called life at only being 11-12, boy was I wrong... I learned about Static Abuse, Encapsulation, Classes, Databases, and my mind was saying to give up and just forget it because I was so young and the last thing I could even comprehend was SQL, I mean why would I need that? It’s only a database right? I can just use files and continue storing information in YML and JSON format right? .... WRONG, if I wanted my plugins to work across servers then I needed a database... that was where it ended though, I decided that I had no interest in it and it wasn’t like anyone would use my plugins so I stopped and for maybe 1-2 years I took a break and got back into gaming...

__The Revival__
I’m now 14-15 and I wanted to learn a ton of things, I mean I knew Java or mostly how it worked by then and I had been watching a lot of hacking videos as well as programming videos so I knew of how hacking was simply exploiting a vulnerability in a piece of software whether it be a problem with confirmation or in the code itself I still knew what it was. So I knew how important it was make sure I tried to make everything I created as secure as I possibly could. So I started learning Java but instead of plugins for Minecraft servers I started with Discord bots and I realized that Java was a strong language and you could do so much more with it so I decided to link that bot to a MySQL database and learned the basic commands to MySQL but still was foreign to the idea of relations to other tables (foreign keys), primary keys, etc. I was bored though so I gave up on the bot but I still have it online with the server that has been abandoned but if anyone wishes to view it then feel free to say in the comments and I will be more than happy to share the link.

__Making Progress__
So it’s the beginning of Junior year now, and during the summer I learned about HTML, CSS, and a minor bit about JavaScript. I was dabbling in a bit of PHP but decided to drop it until maybe 2 months later. Now I am in Upstate, New York and I attend a program called boces and I have a Web Development class which we use a very foreign language called WebDNA, to create backends to websites and honestly it was easy. I wanted a challenge, I wanted to really challenge myself! So I threw myself right into the deep end. I created a hackintosh, bought an Apple Developer License and got to writing an iOS app in Swift (at the time I didn’t know Objective-C was usually more commonly used), and I wanted to make a anonymous messaging app so I did all the research, setup my SnapSDK, setup my Web Server for being able to send requests to the server and retrieve JSON responses based off of the request. It took forever though because Swift was so unknown to me, in a way it was so similar to Java but it was also the complete opposite. I got the hang of it though and quickly overcame many problems. I got the app done and fixed up the web server and made sure to secure the accounts, messages, and such to ensure that the files wouldn’t be accessed easily by a bad actor or at least I believe that they are fairly secure.

__What now?__
Well now that’s as far as my story goes because I still have so much to build on and recently just started throwing myself into Node.JS, and I’m loving it every bit! I can’t wait to keep on learning these things because these are key jobs that are in such high demand nowadays especially when it comes to Deep Learning, AI, etc. So I think I’m going to create some apps that will use AI, to learn the user and help the user relieve stress with what it knows about the user but that’s just an idea.

__Proof__
[My App](https://truthordare.hexhamnetwork.com)

[GitHub (Not much to see there tho)](https://www.github.com/reheight)

__Extra__
Now I am only 16 almost 17, but I am very proud of myself, I have really done a lot with what I know and I am always looking to learn more and more. I know that clearly I have SO MUCH to still learn especially when it comes to security, but in my opinion I am one smart 16 year old!

__TL;DR__
I am a 16 year old who in the time span of 8 years have learned 10+ languages for fun, normally to kill time, and eventually took interest in making and app and I now have an app on the iOS App Store.

__TO BE CONTINUED...__

ekwboc,aetv,"We are The Hosts From Live Rescue, Matt Iseman, Capt. Garon Mosby of St. Louis FD and Paramedic ＆ Nurse Dan Flynn, Ask Us Anything!","Hosted by Matt Iseman with analysis from Captain Garon Mosby of the St. Louis Fire Department and Dan Flynn, a Registered Paramedic and Registered Nurse, “Live Rescue” airs on A＆E on Monday nights at 9pm ET/PT.  “Live Rescue” follows America’s first responders as they bravely put their lives on the line answering emergency rescue calls across the country.  Tonight at 9PM is the premiere of season 2 which will have a commercial free hour. 

Matt Iseman is Host of A＆E’s live documentary series, “Live Rescue.”  He is perhaps best known as the host of the four time Emmy-nominated “American Ninja Warrior.”  The Boston Globe has said of him, “The best part about American Ninja Warrior, hands down, is when bro-host Matt Iseman roars the show’s title.” He also helms the latest spinoff, American Ninja Warrior Junior, on Universal Kids (it’s their highest rated show ever) and he headed up the spinoff, “ANW: Ninja vs. Ninja” on the USA Network. Matt hosted Evel Live  and Evel Live 2 on History, the highest rated cable specials of 2018  and 2019 respectively, and makes regular visits to the Today Show.  He is a licensed physician with a medical degree from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.  “Life is short, do what makes you happy.” That’s the advice that Matt got from his Dad, a world renowned physician, when Matt quit medicine to pursue stand up comedy. 

Garon Mosby has twenty-five years of service to the citizens of St. Louis City: twenty years with the St. Louis Fire Department and five years with the St. Louis Police Department. Mosby currently serves as the Captain and Public information Officer. In addition to serving as the traditional liaison between the media and the fire service, Captain Mosby proactively utilizes various social media platforms to create a direct portal from the fire service to the stakeholder, thereby creating the ultimate vision of transparency.  Captain Mosby also mentors at Peabody Elementary. He serves on the Board of the Missouri Critical Incident Stress Management Team, the Communication Board for the St. Louis American Red Cross, and is the Public Information Officer for the International Association Of Black Professional Firefighters.

Dan Flynn is a Nationally Registered Paramedic and Registered Nurse in New Orleans, Louisiana.  He has been working in the Emergency Medical Services since 2001, starting in a Fire-based service in Mandeville, LA working as a Firefighter/Paramedic. He joined New Orleans EMS in 2003 and remains a current active employee as a Field Training Officer.  Dan holds multiple other certifications, including NRP, ACLS, PALS, and HAZMAT Technician. He is a member of NAEMT and the Emergency Nursing Association. His career achievements include working as a Paramedic/Firefighter during and following Hurricane Katrina.  He was featured on the A＆E documentary series, “Nightwatch,” and the A＆E digital series, “First Responders.”

ekkw6v,blainicus,"For seven years, I've been developing a spiritual successor to Minecraft and MMORPGs, called ""Lost Existence"". It launched recently on Steam. AMA!","###Introduction

Hey Reddit! I'm Sean Egan, owner of the small indie game studio ""Lurid Spectre Games"". For the last seven years, we've been creating the First-Person Voxel Action-RPG ""Lost Existence"" in Java. We launched the game on Steam in Early Access on November 21st.

[PROOF](https://twitter.com/LuridSpectre/status/1213955172197654528?s=20)

------------------

###What is Lost Existence?

You can view the store page, trailers, and more information about the game here:

[STORE/TRAILERS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1129730/Lost_Existence/)

Lost Existence is a game about exploring an ancient planet full of ruins and secrets, fighting for survival, and forging your own unique character class. It also features incredibly smooth multiplayer, pvp teams, and support for player-made dungeons.

Lost Existence is run in its own original engine based in Java and supported by LWJGL. All code and engines are new, it is not a mod.

------------------

###About Us

I've been working alongside Scott Rogers, who made all of the graphical assets, and Sam Gossner, who created all of the sound. I also have to thank our dozen or so alpha testers, we couldn't have done it without them.

My work consists of all of the game design and coding, as well as creating the background systems to support the content. For the entire duration of development, and even up to this day, I've been working full time refining the engine and fixing bugs; it's an endless job.

I am a husband, father, Marine Veteran, teacher, business consultant, host of The Sharpe Way Show, and 2018 Libertarian Candidate for Governor of NY.

During my campaign, I held over 300 live, public events, including at least one in each of New York's 62 counties (a #fullsharpe). In 2019, I completed another #fullsharpe, of over 100 live, public events, including at least one in each of New York's 62 counties. People ask me often why I am spending this much of my personal time meeting and talking with voters across New York State, even when I'm not running for office. It's because it still matters. In fact the longer we remain in highest in the nation for all the wrong reasons, the more liberty concepts and innovative ideas to solve problems matter.

I am looking forward to answering your questions today. During the campaign, our conversations focused mostly on topics specific to New Yorkers, including repealing the SAFE Act, innovative education options, eliminating the state income tax, facilitating innovative non-taxpayer funding, eliminating tolls, localizing more government decisions, transparent government, relieving over-regulated farmers, saving Main Street, criminal justice reform, family court reform, supporting newer industries that NYS is crushing, and stopping the population exodus from NY.

Since the election, conversations often cover topics affecting the nation or the world. In all cases, the goal is to change the culture of governance from one of bribery and punishment to one of innovation and choices.

I don't have many physical abilities anymore. I'm also a YouTuber and Graphic Design student. Please AMA!","Hey everyone!

Some of you may remember the AMA I did a little over a year ago. I got an overwhelming response last time so I thought it was time I did another one.

If you don’t, I was born with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and have dealt with many things related to it. Most people don't feel comfortable asking about disabilities even though they might be curious and just assume things. As I'm getting older, I've been advocating and informing a lot. My goal is to leave a lasting impact and I hope someone will learn something new from this.

Some background about me:

* I lost the ability to walk about 14 years ago when I was 9.
* I really have no arm strength. Just enough hand and wrist strength to control my power wheelchair and use a computer mouse and use a customized PS4 controller.
* I have lost a cousin and uncle to DMD.
* I use Non-invasive ventilation which is using a ventilator to take deeper breathes using a mouthpiece during the day as needed and a mask at night
* Started a YouTube channel about 1 1/2 years about different adaptions in my life and things I enjoy. [https://www.youtube.com/c/MilanPatel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MilanPatel)
* I have developed a photography hobby in the last year.

I will answer any question so please ask me anything at all! Hopefully, you'll learn something new!

ejz5l4,NoImNotJustAsian,"I am a self taught app developer, who learned through coding a little bit everyday for the last three years. Today I am launching my first application to help others do the same. AMA","Hi my name is Shing So and I have been following a No Zero Days mentality for the last three years and have taught myself how to develop phone apps. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/Aaj75R7)

**Background**

Three years ago I ran into a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about a system called No Zero Days. The idea was to do something everyday, no matter the size, towards your goal. No having much direction or knowledge, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code. When I first started I bought a online course and tackled one video lesson a day. Starting off, I learned very slowly. I took several beginner coding courses as I wasn't picking up a lot of the key concepts. Eventually I went towards application development and began coding, 1-2 hours, on simple applications everyday.

A big leap forward in my learning journey came from another reddit post, which talked about Learning How to Learn. Learning How To Learn gave insight on why I procrastinated so much.  After applying several of the methods learned for learning, I was understanding material much quicker. Through applying these learning methods, I learned how to use AWS and deployed my own servers so I could utilize a backend for my apps. Learning How to Learn is a free course on which you can find [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).

**What have I learned?**

The most important lesson that I have learned through my journey is that difficult problems and concepts generally take more than one look to solve or understand. A tendency that I used to have was to give up at the first sign of difficultly. Its scary when something doesn't click in your head and you have to face the idea that maybe you never under figure it out.

There were many times when I was developing an application where I would run into a problem I thought was impossible for me to solve. I would be dealing with the same problem for weeks, not making any progress towards a solution. Although there were many times I doubted my own ability to solve a problem, there wasn't a single time were a didn't eventually find a solution.

Another lesson is that habits work better than motivation. Motivation is very good at burst of actions but don't really help when times get difficult. Achieving goals and getting good at something requires consistent action and a long term commitment. Habits take between three month to a year to form depending on what you are to do. I believe that building good habits is the best investment you can make.

Also when starting something new, it's best to take slow small steps. It's more important to form long term habits than to go hard and eventually give up.

**Whats the app?**

The application I am launching today is called Steps - Action Inspires. It's a social media application crossed between a habit tracker. You set Todos, which is an action you plan to do consistently throughout the week. Whenever you complete a Todo, it shows up on your followers feeds. Your media feed is comprised of actions of the people you follow.

Tracking your progress is crucial when you attempting something new and challenging . A huge motivating factor for me was seeing the growth and improvement I was making. I believe that by seeing what others are doing towards their goals and the effort it takes to become successful is inspirational and provides additional motivation

**Moving Forward**

As coding everyday is a strong habit of mine, I will continue to work on coding and improving Steps everyday. There are still many aspects which will be improved on such as design. You can follow me on my app, my username is im\_so\_shing. I'll definitely follow you back as I am excited to see the progress and actions people will take.

I've made a simple website to showcase the application at [stepsactioninspires.com](https://stepsactioninspires.com) and if you would like to start your Steps today you can download it on [IOS (apple store page)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steps-action-inspires/id1491714172?ls=1) and [Android (google play page)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stepsdebugv2)",657,1578157457,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ejz5l4/i_am_a_self_taught_app_developer_who_learned/,IAmA,3485

ejy1hs,thedebtreliefco,We are The Debt Relief Company- ask us anything!,"The Debt Relief Company was founded by a group of relatively young entrepreneurs that decided we were sick of putting corporate profit ahead of helping people in need. Although our backgrounds and experiences all differ greatly, many of us were former employees from the largest debt settlement/debt relief companies around today. We grew tired of seeing people burdened by credit card debt being taking advantage of so we formed what is now The Debt Relief Company. Some of us are former certified financial advisors, experts in mortgage modifications, financial consultants, negotiation specialists, financial planners, etc. We are all qualified financial consultants and we all have a tremendous amount of experience helping people burdened with credit card debt and unsecured debt. Not to sound overly altruistic but we formed out of a desire to provide Americans with legitimate and honest help and provide free financial advice whenever possible. We charge no up-front fees and most of the time we postpone client fees for months to years so long as it helps their bottom-line and helps them get their life back on track. We like to think that customer service and people come first, not profits. The inspiration and idea for our company came about over a decade ago during the financial crisis when our co-founders began helping an aunt with a debt negotiation plan and another family member with a mortgage modification.

Many of our clients today have been carrying credit card debt for quite some time and we created this AMA today to help people avoid needing our services in the future (as crazy as that may sound). We constantly receive questions like “I wish I knew more about debt and credit before opening all these accounts”, “How exactly does interest work?”, or “I got a summons, what do I do now?”.

We pride ourselves on being able to educate and empower our clients with financial know-how but also have a desire to provide financial literacy for the general public in the US. 

Feel free to ask us anything related to debt, credit, interest, budgeting, financial planning, etc.

ejqbzg,thornforever,"IAmAdora Bautista, an anonymous sex worker and amateur porn performer. AMA!","Hey there, /r/IAmA! I go by Adora Bautista, and began my sex work career in 2011 when I was 19, after a friend convinced me to go work in a strip club to make some money for college. From there, **I forayed into camming, phone sex operating, panty selling, and more, all the while, hiding this part of my life from most of the people I know, especially my family.** Nowadays, I’m working on building my income through clip selling (ManyVids, Clips4Sale, Modelhub, etc.) and offering fan club subscriptions, currently through OnlyFans and AVN Stars. To help customers and lurkers sift through the content and services I offer, I just created a [new website](https://adorabautista.com). And I also have a [blog](https://blog.adorabautista.com)! It’s pretty bare-bones now, but I’m hoping it will appeal to many people, including fellow performers, customers, and especially for those curious about the industry.

I also have experience with sugaring and escorting (under a different name), although I am transitioning out of those. However, I’m still working those hustles (plus stripping) because they’re good for short-term income and I’m saving up to start a few businesses and nonprofits whose missions are near-and-dear to my heart - where my true passions lie.

So...now that you know a little bit about my adult career, what about my work, life, passions, etc. are you curious about? Ask Me Anything!

**TL;DR:** Started stripping in 2011, and have since gone into camming, phone sex, operating, panty selling, etc. Mostly work on selling clips and fan club subscriptions now. New website and blog up. Transitioning out of escorting, sugaring, and stripping, but still work those for short-term income and to save up for my true passions: starting businesses and nonprofits. All of this is being done without most of the people in my life, especially family, knowing. AMA!

ejmp7u,ThunderOrb,I breed pigeons that are bred and trained to steal other pigeons. AMA,"Posted this in /r/ama yesterday, but thought maybe I'd get more traction here, if anyone was interested. Example of one of my thief pouters [here](https://v.redd.it/b2pt9v0cbe841).

Little background: Thief pouters have been around for centuries. In the beginning, they were used to steal racing pigeons from others as the birds returned home. 

This practice was eventually outlawed, naturally, since no one likes having their stuff stolen. That's when thief breeders turned on each other and started (sometimes not so) friendly competitions to see who could capture whose birds. If someone else's thief caught your thief, they got to keep it. Those are the rules of the game.

As the hobby spread out to other countries/continents, there were fewer people to compete with, so breeders started practicing what is called ""zuritero"" - which is where they compete to see who can catch the most feral pigeons. 

While catching ferals lacks some of the excitement of trying to steal other thieves, it does present its own challenges. Ferals are much more wary of people and pigeon lofts than a domestic pigeon would be, so it can be hard for the thieves to actually lure them into the loft. 

AMA about pigeons, thief pouters, or whatever you want to ask me - related or not.

Edit: [Here's](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/06/doo-pigeons-flying-scotland/) an article National Geographic did on the hobby in Scotland. It's pretty big over there.

Edit edit: [Hope this counts as proof?](https://imgur.com/a/w8HKAZM)

Edit x3: It's late now, the questions are slowing down, and the wife is demanding I get off this ole machine and pay her some attention. I'll check back sometime tomorrow to catch any stragglers if they have novel questions. It's been a lot of fun, you guys.

UPDATE: The live AMA has officially ended, but keep the questions coming! I will do my best to answer EVERY SINGLE ONE!

In 2012 I moved to Austin, TX with my girlfriend Erin. Me as a musician and her as a graphic designer. We bought our first house, a dirt cheap foreclosure in South Austin and immediately tilled up the back yard to plant habaneros because, well, habaneros are the BEST. Yellowbird is a story of how two crazy people started a small hot sauce brand in Austin that somehow developed a cult following and gained significant national recognition. I've never done one of these and I am absolutely HERE to answer your most random questions.

ej5wwp,fearless1927,"I am a 92 year old German born Jew who grew up in the Hitler youth and was forced to fight in WW2 in the German anti-tank division. I deserted and became a POW in a British camp and eventually moved to Canada in 1955. Just recently, I published a memoir of my life. AMA","I was born in 1927 in Herne, Germany. To quote from my memoir, ""I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family."" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.

Though I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.

When the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.

In 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.

My family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.

My wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\_1\_4?keywords=fearless&amp;qid=1578004297&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&amp;qid=1578004297&amp;sr=8-4)

Hello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.

Below we have attached some photos from his life

Hello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.

Also, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.",7940,1578005991,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ej5wwp/i_am_a_92_year_old_german_born_jew_who_grew_up_in/,IAmA,69871

New age was a way to cope with the new paradigm I found myself in. Before 2016 I was a stone cold atheist, still am to a degree. New age is actually a really scary place to be, it basically means you god wont save you only you can save you. A lot of other new agers at least online are struggling in life or have struggled and are often called mentally ill. Once I was put on psychiatric medication I wasn't having as much spiritual trouble so I took a break from the New Age discussion online but I checked back today for some reason and its the same thing they were preaching in 2012: Earth is ascending, new wave of feminine energy coming in, nature is cleansing itself, all that.

It just didn't add up to me, and I've been attempting to prove it ever since. 

If I receive one single message from a Redditor, my hypothesis will be debunked and I will be embarrassed live on stream.

I've lived with fear and anxiety of my own parents for a fear years heard talking about my past with people can help. Ask me Anything","I'll just prop up a little so some people have something to go off of for questions. Hell started around my 12 Birthday. I'm going to sound like a spoiled brat (or at least that's how I think I come across when this comes up and I voice my concerns) but know for background info I have two married parents, two younger sisters, one who's only two and a half years younger and the other who's nine years younger and has gone through Cancer. Parents have Very Stable jobs, we bought the optometry practice in the area a few years back and my father works as a project manager for an international company that has a station in our area.

I'd like to be asked some questions because I found that talking about my past, though it generally makes me cry or get really emotional in other ways, it slowly has been helping me and I really want this to not be a repeat for my 18th when I finally get to leave these people.

ehupr3,LoosechangeXxXx,I'm a thin 24 year old and I recently had a heart attack. AMA,"I was closing up for work around 8:30 Saturday after scarfing down some Chinese food to the point I was stuffed beyond belief, that was about 10 minutes prior. As I was closing I started feeling a tight pain in my chest but it was towards my throat in the middle not the left side so I figured I ate too much (I'm probe to heartburn so I thought this was my first case of bad indigestion). I finished my close and served a feel people while trying to act like I wasn't in any pain (as I figured it was my own fault and nothing serious). 9pm rolls by (closing) and I get my Uber and as soon as I sit down in it my arm goes numb and I start sweating, now I'm starting to get nervous and google heart attack symptoms. I get home about 9:15 and spend the next 20 minutes asking my friends if they think I could be having a heart attack and what they'd do and all just kinda laugh and say probably not but if you're worried go get it checked. So I called Telehealth (Canadian health line you should use for non serious conditions before wasting the hospital's time) and explained what happened and now this person is telling me I need to go NOW so Im kinda freaking now and call an Uber to the emergency. I get their to a completely packed waiting room and almost decide to turn around and go home (almost a huge mistake) but a friend tells me I should do it since I'm already there and leave if they don't think it's anything at the check in.so they hook me up to some wires for a chest scan which doesn't show anything and they do a blood test. Another half hour or so goes by its around 11ish and they tell me they need to redo the test and this time lead me back to the observation, now I'm really freaked because this is a step before being admitted. They continue to do blood tests every 2 hours and around 3:30 they come in and tell me I'm not going to be able to leave as I did in fact have a heart attack. As of now I'm in the hospital just waiting for an appointment at a heart institute.

Tldr: I thought I was having a heart attack and almost didn't go, and I was. Always go get checked with strange chest pain.

 I'm an American cop who is on a SWAT team. Prior to being a cop, I worked for an airline and prior to that I was in the Air Force. 

I have been streaming on the internet for close to a decade. I started with streaming Pokemon Red and seeing how far I could get in the game without using a PokeCenter. I have since modernized and stream on Twitch at [Twitch.tv/pdchampagne](https://Twitch.tv/pdchampagne)where I play mostly FPS and MOBA games. 

I am doing this AMA for a couple reasons. I'll start with the self serving one;

From now until June I am fundraising for the [Special Olympics](https://www.specialolympics.org/). All money my [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/pdchampagne)generates for the next 6 months will be donated and I will match the first $500.00

I run in the Special Olympics Torch Run every year and do fundraising until the actual run. I raised close to $1000.00 last year. If you want to donate directly, follow the Special Olympics link above. [Charitynavigator.org](https://Charitynavigator.org) gives the Special Olympics charity 90/100 overall as a reliable charity.

The second reason is I have seen an uptick in ""swatting"" calls. I know this happened a few years ago and I figured since it's happening again, I might be able to shed some light. 

Feel free to ask my anything!

ehlyof,curate-hashtags,I copied my favorite SaaS landing page and made it my own 👀,"As your business grows and solves the problems of your customers, things *will* change. The more you talk or write about your business, you will understand how to better sell it. You will continue to add new features and refine your copy. Over time you will start to be more concise in the explanation of the benefits it provides. You stumble across new ways to present your business that you haven't considered. There are endless iterations of improvements to make based on the stage that it is currently at.

What if your target market shifted and you needed to appeal to a different demographic? Undertaking a redesign like that is more than just changing a screenshot and a couple sentences. This is where I was with my B2B SaaS, [**Curate**](http://curate-app.com/),  made for helping Instagram Business users with organic growth. I was *kind of* happy with the current landing page that I had. It was already the 3rd iteration and I felt like I had achieved what I was going for. There were two problems though. One was that all of the screenshots were depicting the old app experience and it was just [**completely redesigned**](https://www.blog.curate-app.com/how-i-redesigned-my-entire-b2b-saas-app-in-30-days/). The other problem was that the branding was catering to the wrong market. Previously the branding was playful, loud and less refined. It was meant to cater to the ""Influencer"" demographic on Instagram. Although at its core, the copy and message were clear.  


It needed to appear more sophisticated, more professional and slightly enterprise to fit my new target customer. Some of the lengthy wording needed to be simplified so I could let the message speak for itself. It was also important to have a better foundation to be able to rapidly add more ""landing page"" style content such as use cases, feature deep dives, user interviews, competition comparisons and more.

One of the motivators for taking on this redesign challenge was that I found so much inspiration in one of my favorite SaaS companies that I follow, [**Canny**](https://canny.io/). They help other SaaS companies track feedback to build better products. They aren't anywhere close to being the same space as Curate but I love the presentation, simplicity and effectiveness of their landing pages. The way that they present what their SaaS does is great, so great that I decided to ""copy"" it! Using their website as a template, I was able to go from my first commit to the production deployment and redesign all my landing pages in *just 5 days*.

I wrote about are some tips for [how to ""copy"" your favorite landing pages](https://www.blog.curate-app.com/how-i-copied-my-favorite-saas-landing-page/) for your own landing page redesign.

It was 2012 and we wanted to have a worthwhile New Year's Eve with our friends, so we've put together a few questions that would help us focus. The event was an absolute success, our idea resonated really well with others. We thought that this could be something useful and decided to make a booklet. Next year we made it public on the internet. We thought maybe we would have a couple hundred downloads and make a few people happy. Next thing we know – it went viral. Today the YearCompass booklet is available in 39 different languages (translated by volunteers) and had 1.200.000 downloads last year.

We believe in self-awareness. Self-recognition is one of the key things to become a better human – and we need a lot of awesome humans on this planet. The path is not easy and we enjoy helping anyone who needs help, this is why we created the booklet and the YearCompass movement.

We're not going to be checking proof for Christmas and we'll be relaxing our rules for posting.  For the holiday season, the mods of [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) have decided to relax our rules. We will be allowing some posts that either cannot provide sufficient proof, or posts that don't necessarily comply with our rule that the topic play a significant role in a person's life. So, if you have considered doing an AMA about a topic before but didn't think you would qualify, now is your chance! If you want to do an AMA about some more common thing about you or a hobby you like have at it.   


These posts will all have the ""Casual Christmas"" Flair.

While celebrating with us, please don't post AMAs pretending to be some living person you're not though who would not appreciate it. If Santa shows up for an AMA though the mod team isn't going to Grinch out on you though. Also, please note: NSFW/NSFL/spam/posts that break reddit rules rules will still be removed.

eglag5,defamerAMA,"For years I’ve been seeing people post about not sharing shooters names, I decided to create software that will automatically hide the name/face of the shooter and prevent them from becoming famous, I'm Izzy with DeFamer AMA","When I was younger I saw a man on TV that had committed a horrible violent crime at a movie theater. I still to this day remember his face very vividly. I thought about it when I got older and I realized I could still remember that mans face, his eye shape, his name, his hair color. Everything. It bothered me a lot.   


It bothered me so much I started looking into ways this can be prevented. How could I avoid seeing people like that and giving them space in my brain rent free forever? There are a few options, but all of them virtually beg the media outlets to not show the face (and they still do) or other slow non functioning methods to remove the assailants face and name. I realized that NOBODY had come up with a way to resolve this.  


I was laying down one night and I realized that if there was a way to remove all the millions of photos of criminals from the internet, new and old, it would require an army. That's when the idea for DeFamer hit me, we would need an actual mass group of people to help with this project.  


The idea is actually really simple, people right click on an image of an alleged criminal and select ""Tag as alleged criminal"" then it blurs the persons face. You can highlight text and select ""Name of assailant"" so on and so fourth. It will then begin to blur the image for people across the extension/app.   


I'm truly passionate about this project and I'm more than excited to answer any questions you may have, please feel free to ask me anything about the project.  


I have been working on DeFamer for approximately 4 years, the initial idea was a reverse image search but that proved to be way more complicated than it appears.

egg266,Ima_commite_not_see,I am your edgy pre- teen girl with kind of a tragic past AMA,"I am a 12 yo edgy girl, I have kind of a tragic past (which I'll explain further in this and in the answers).  
I am a non English speaker, so misspellings are expected.  
A bit of explanation of the past:  
I was born in a family of 5, me, my mother, two sisters and my dad. Now, my dad was (and still is) unemployed so my mom had to work her fullest to be able to handle three children. My two sisters are both older than me (the oldest at the time was 18 and the other 16) and were mostly not home. As for my dad, he was an alcoholic (24/7) and was drunk most of the time, that leaded to abusive convos and well overall abusive acts. At the time of the biggest event I was 8, this will explain to you some of my decisions and moves.  
A bit info about the main event:  
It was a fight between my dad and my oldest sister, it was night. He was of course drunk, my mom was yet to be back from work. And it all started with me simply staying at a friend's for a bit longer.  
As for proof... I am not really sure what I can give. I guess a picture would be okay?

egg0rz,Portarossa,"I am Hazel Redgate, AKA Portarossa, and I've been a professional smutwriter for six years. AMA!","**Who am I?** I've been working as a full-time smut-slinger, word-pimp and prosestitute for about six years now, first in short-form erotica and more recently in romance novels. I get asked fairly regularly on Reddit for advice on how best to get started, so I figure an AMA is as good an opportunity to clear up as many misconceptions as possible and collect all the advice I've got to give in one place for anyone who thinks it might be something they're interested in -- either as a potential career, or just as a hobby.

On account of it being my cakeday -- and because would it *really* be an AMA if I wasn't shilling something? -- I've released three of my books for free for the next five days:

* **Reckless** is a novel about a Texas diner owner whos ex-boyfriend rolls back into town after a decade away -- now a famous musician, and eager to rekindle their romance.

* **Smooth** is a novel about an uptight Chicago lawyer who, newly single after breaking up with her fiancé, finds herself in New Orleans for her best friend's wedding -- only to find herself crossing paths with a freewheeling jazz musician.

* **Love at Christmas** is a collection of novellas about four single sisters who find a little Christmas romance waiting for them under the tree. (Not with each other, you perverts. With other people.) It's a soft little slice of festive romance.

You can also check out my website, [HazelRedgate.com](https://hazelredgate.com), where I release short erotica and romance for free, twice a week. (I also have [a Patreon](https://patreon.com/HaelRedgate), if that's your bag, or you can find me at [my subreddit](https://reddit.com).)

If there's anything you want to know about writing for a living, writing *smut* for a living, how to make your dialogue -- or your dirty talk -- really pop, what the deal is with airline food, how to go about getting your stuff noticed, what *Star Wars* has to do with structuring romantic fiction, or literally *anything else*, fire away!

Both of my parents went to highly selective private schools, and I was educated in private primary and secondary schools and subsequently matriculated at an Ivy League school, where I study economics and have work in finance lined up after I graduate this spring (although I am seriously considering other alternatives since finance in general is soul-crushing work). Furthermore, my long-term girlfriend's family is also heavily involved in finance and she is heading to a prestigious law school after rounding out her time as an undergraduate at... you guessed it. An Ivy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to offer as proof since I don't want to post family properties for obvious personal information concerns, so instead I'll post a statement of my Spring semester's college bursar bill. For reference, in order to not qualify for *any* financial aid at my school, you need to make multiple times to median US household income.

I am currently single, after my last relationship ended early this year. I've had a few long-lasting relationships in my life, who never knew about my visits to prostitutues. I have two children. I would consider myself attractive, in good shape, and have a universtity degree.

efkmam,momknowsbest64,Ask me why I forgave the man responsible for my son's death,"  

Christmas day.. 

Tough day for me. Tough time of year – tough time to work up to. Last month around this time I was working up to the speech in memory of my son. Another emotional build up but there is always something that those of us that are grieving are working on, towards, away from. We are building up the strength to handle their birthday, the day they died, another family celebration without our loved one and now today, Christmas, officially my 3rd without him but I’d really consider this my first as it’s the first year I put up a tree. The first year I wrapped presents for my other son, the first year I had no presents under the tree for the son who passed away.

It’s hard… every day is hard… but these days are especially hard and working up to them only remind you of what you don’t have. You aren’t shopping for two anymore, you aren’t wrapping for two anymore (and of course trying to make it evenly distributed between the boys), You aren’t stuffing stockings for 2…. The house seems some much less joyous.

I am/well was a Christmas-a-holic so for me, to not have put up the tree was significant, but I did this year for my living son. I have to admit the tree looked beautiful and it was nice to feel a bit of the Christmas spirit, but it wasn’t the same. It isn’t the same. There remains a huge void I my heart. A year ago today I made a post here looking for my son's heart 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a9go6z/looking\_for\_my\_sons\_heart\_in\_canada\_even\_though/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a9go6z/looking_for_my_sons_heart_in_canada_even_though/)

and I found him thanks to so many kind people and have spent a wonderful year connected to this amazing man I am lucky to have gotten to know ) but today is a much different day with a much different feeling. While I grieve and will continue to miss my son for the rest of my life, I have been on quite a spiritual journey these last 6-8 months and have found myself led towards a desire to better myself in ways more grounded in things I can’t describe. Trying to think kinder thoughts, trying to speak only with love and leading more with my heart. I’ve been reading books on becoming more spiritually aware, (The Power of Now, The Untethered Soul, Being your Higher Self, Awakening Your Life’s Purpose) because I feel there has to be more to this life than to work, eat sleep and being a slave to my grief. I must find the meaning of everything that has happened to me and in particular what I am supposed to do with all this love I still have inside for my son. How and where I am to channel this? I’ve realized that I’ve been going about this all wrong. 

Being in grief groups you are surrounded by angry people who are struggling to accept their loss and certainly that whatever is good in any higher power really exists. I had quite the opposite experience. I knew (or at least thought) He didn’t exist – before the death of my son because, to be honest, I felt nothing. When my son died, my son had become more spiritually aware and while I’m thankful he had – I felt nothing. After he died however so much started to change and I started to feel very different and I began to feel the need to seek out more information about what was happening to me and felt as if I was guided to grow. 

I was guided to start Yoga and calm my mind/soul. I was guided to begin Reike treatments and started to read books about energy healing and I started to feel more as though I thought my son was in a higher place and that there was something bigger at play than just me and my thoughts and my grief.

I realize I’m a bit all over the place with this but bear with me. When my son first overdosed I had his phone. I had his unlock key and I was able to see who texted him and who he texted. I know who dealt my son the lethal dose of Fentanyl and that night I handed that phone over the police as we sat in the hospital waiting room while my son was on life support. “HERE IS MY SON’S KILLER!!!, CALL HIM AND ARREST HIM!!”. I knew w he was in my son’s phone as Jimmy G. 

Through my sons friends I was able to determine who he was (No his real name isn’t Jimmy and to protect him I won’t reveal his real name, or his last name but I eventually found out who he was) and to be honest, I wanted him to be found. At first by the police, but when the police didn’t work/move fast enough I didn’t care how he was ratted out, or by whom, I just wanted him to pay for my son’s death. I also wanted the man who got my son into drugs to also pay and I regretted sending him some terrible messages over the following weeks that I wish he suffered for my son’s passing as well (he didn’t come to the funeral – I’m sure he knew how I felt about him) . That person let’s just call him “W” for now remains addicted to heroin. As time moved on, the police never arrested Jimmy and I wanted so much to out him. I knew his name, had his phone number – had his Instagram account (as he was “friends” with my son’s Instagram) had all the evidence I needed to convict him (or so I thought) but my brother is a police officer and he told me, you can’t prove even if he was the one who answered the text that it was him that dropped off the drugs to my son. You can’t prove that he “knew” that there was no heroin in the drugs that my son thought he received that night. 

My son was meticulous about being safe in the amount of drugs he used. He took his scale out. We know by the text message he asked for .5g which was his “normal order” and he had .4 left in his pocket so he measured .1 grams of the stuff and we assumed snorted it and then came outside to have a cigarette. Less than 15 minutes later my son would be vital signs absent on the back deck. What was in that drug that .1 gram of substance given to my son was 0 heroin and **4 times a lethal dose of fentanyl**.

As weeks turned to months and months to a year Jimmy changed his phone number- Sometimes I would call it, blocking my number of course and found out his phone was no longer active. Through messaging however, I managed to get his newer number and gave that number to the police but the trail had gone cold and no one was looking for my son’s killer anymore. I often wonder how many other died that night or overdosed. 

Did he know the drugs were laced? 

Did he do it on purpose?

Did he find out my son died because of it? (How could he not, all the kids know each other)

How does he live with himself now?

How does he live knowing he killed someone in the name of making a few bucks

Perhaps that’s enough to have to deal with. Perhaps knowing you were cause of the death of someone else is your cross to bear. I would have to think any reasonable human being would have a hard time living with that and I tend to think that most people are decent human beings and that’s when my feelings began to change about him.

I didn’t need to see him suffer anymore. I didn’t need to make him pay for the death of my son, he’s already paying. He already must live with the knowledge that his actions took the life of someone else and living with that for the rest of his life is probably a larger burden than anyone would want.

Holding onto anger is equally a larger burden than I want to carry. I don’t want to stay angry at him or hold out the hope that he will pay. Karma will be his destiny and I time, his life will be testament to his decisions. At some point, he will have to accountable, even IF ONLY TO HIS OWN MORAL COMPASS – and he too will answer to some higher power for his actions.

So… I forgive him. Not for him, but for me. I forgive him this Christmas day – to release myself of the pain of being angry, and the energy it takes to hold onto that anger. I forgive “W” too for introducing my son into heroin and if I could I would tell them face to face.

Life is already too hard without the need for anger and it’s much better with love and peace on this day. I spent a year trying to find my purpose and I think as we move into 2020 I will continue to seek out that journey but now I won’t be seeded in any place of hatred or anger towards the man who was responsible for my son’s death. Even though my son's death was ruled an accident by the coroner and I'm equally sure people will have opinions on those who use drug, I too will forgive any negativity sent my way for what you know not of addiction and mental health AND before unkind words are said --------&gt;, Love is love is love to all of you. 

I see now he’s a real estate agent in my town. I guess he’s trying to turn his life around. Perhaps that's the beginning of his new journey - maybe that’s a good thing, but for me, I can move forward with a clear conscience and a loving soul.

My psychic had told me I was going to meet my twin flame soon, and when I met him he was just how she had described him. He recognized me from his dream, and we both knew this wasn't a coincidence. 

We fell in love quickly and now that we have gone through all the twin flame stages (honeymoon phase, running and chasing, turmoil, reunion etc), we have learnt A LOT about the twin flame journey. 

We noticed that most twin flame ""gurus"" are not even in harmonious union with their twin flame, so we decided to create Twin Flame Guides and help others reunite with their twin flames.

ef180o,revanon,"It's Christmas Eve, and I'm a parish pastor. AMA!","  

Merry Christmas Eve, all y’all! It’s time for the decking of halls, a weekly/monthly/annual trip to church, and my annual AMA thread here on reddit!

I’ve been in parish ministry for a decade now—nearly seven years as a full-time solo pastor and a combined three years in two different intentionally temporary positions—and I am currently in my denomination’s search and call process for a new pastorate as I anticipate that the congregation I currently serve on an interim basis will find a permanent associate pastor sometime in 2020.

So…ask me almost anything (usual disclaimers to follow), whether it’s about Christmas, Christianity, the Bible, the church, how much wood a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood…whatever it is, go for it. I won’t answer a question in a way that would require any betrayal of confidences of any congregants I have ministered to, and I am not speaking here in any official capacity for any of the religious organizations I am affiliated with: my denomination, my region which issues my ministry credentials, the congregation I currently serve, or my publisher.

Speaking of my publisher, my second book, *On Earth as it is in Heaven: A Faith-Based Toolkit for Economic Justice* is now available for preorder direct from my publisher, [Church Publishing](https://www.churchpublishing.org/onearthasitisinheaven), as well as from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Earth-Heaven-Faith-Based-Toolkit-Economic/dp/1640652264/), [Barnes &amp; Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/on-earth-as-it-is-in-heaven-eric-atcheson/1132745648?ean=9781640652262), and plenty of other outlets, along with my debut book, [Oregon Trail Theology: The Frontier Millennial Christians Face—And How We’re Ready.](https://www.churchpublishing.org/oregontrailtheology)

ef0g1g,ActualMatthew,"I am Matthew Berdyck, an activist who exposed corruption, was subjected to death threats, lost my home, was branded as crazy and later vindicated. AMA","In January of 2017, my organization, SuperfundResearch.org, exposed corruption surrounding the redevelopment of the Avtex Superfund toxic waste site, in Warren County Virginia. 

Using a powerful, targeted social media campaign , we investigated and exposed that the alleged $40 million dollar deal didn’t exist, and that Warren County Economic Development Authority, and a man named Curt Tran, were running a scheme. 

Instead of becoming a local hero, I became slathered with death threats, was forced to flee my home, move to another state and then for years, I was branded as a fraud, which infected my life, virtually destroying my entire career. 

All of he sudden, last May, the scandal broke, McDonald was arrested for embezzling $21 million dollars, the Sheriff who would not investigate the prior death threats, was revealed to be her business partner and shot himself when he was indicted. 

I was fully vindicated, but the buried by the media again, including the Washington Post, until The Roanoke Times published two sentences about me that finally confirmed my story. 

Today, I have virtually nothing left, in spite of formerly being with $1.2 million dollars, but at least, to myself, I’ve been set free from the hell I was living in.  

Ask Me Anything.

I began to ask, “Who am I now?” I’m here to talk about the psychological and emotional journey of rebuilding a rewarding life after trauma. AMA","Hi All! I'm Debra Meyerson, a stroke survivor that is thrilled to be alive after a massive stroke in 2010. I want to share what I have learned over the last 9 years about the often forgotten emotional and psychological piece of recovering from traumatic injury such as stroke. My story is about stroke, but these lessons apply to other traumatic injury, life threatening illness, or even just adjusting to retirement or old age.

In 2010, I was a Stanford Professor, athlete, and mother to three. Then I had two strokes that nearly killed me and left me, even after three years of almost full time therapy, with significant speech and physical disabilities. Since then my life has been very different! I read every book I could get my hands on about how to physically recover from stroke. But none of them helped me understand how to cope with the emotional issues associated with my reduced capabilities. I didn't know who I was after my personal and professional life was so thoroughly upended. 

I wrote Identity Theft: Rediscovering Ourselves After Stroke to help those who have suffered from stroke handle the emotional trauma more gracefully. AMA!

eelbfy,Dariendesigns,I am a former Jewel Thief. I stole over 15 million dollars worth of diamonds and jewels up and down the East Coast. AMA!,"This is my second attempt at this. I recently answered questions from Reddit onto YouTube but now I am ready to answer them on the fly, right here. 

I cased places, I stole, and I got rid of it quick. I first started with a heist of wedding dresses that a friend said he could sell off. I quickly made my way up to the big earners: DIAMONDS. It went on for a good few years and then I was caught by the FBI...who were real good. I then spent 12 years in federal prison.

You can check out my YouTube channel where I am currently telling my story. I just posted a video answering some questions from Reddit and now I'm ready to answer some more. You can view some videos and maybe it will spark a question: https://www.youtube.com/larrylawtonjewelthief

————————————————————————


Things you should understand: 


- This is a **long** and seemingly arbitrary process. There are people who saw my post last year, applied, and never got beyond the application process. Others got to the next step to take the AT-SA (an entrance exam of sorts) and never got a response from the FAA after that. Others passed the AT-SA and received a tentative offer letter (TOL) but are still going through the different clearances as we speak a year later.


- You will 99.9% have to relocate. The FAA does not care where you want to live. You will have limited options upon passing the academy that will be presented to you solely based on national staffing needs. There are a lot of facilities hurting for bodies and most of them aren’t in Florida or where your family lives. There are opportunities to transfer once you get in, but it can take time. 


- If you make it through the grueling hiring process and get to the academy, you can still not make it. If you fail your evals at the end of the academy, you will be terminated. If you pass the academy and get to a facility, you can still not make it through on the job training and may be terminated. Nothing is guaranteed until you are a fully certified controller, which takes anywhere from 1-3 years. 


*All that being said*, this is the best job in the world if you can make it. You’ll make anywhere from $70-180k, with some exceptions making over $220k (those guys/girls are busting their asses working mandatory 6 day work weeks at severely understaffed facilities with insane traffic, so take that for what it’s worth). You earn competitive vacation time off, as well as 13 paid sick days per year. At a *healthy* facility, you’ll work 8 hour days with anywhere from 2-4 hours of break time. You will earn a pension that will pay you anywhere from 34-49% of your highest average 3 year pay for the rest of your life. We have mandatory retirement at age 56, but if you have 20 years in you can retire at age 50.


If anybody has any interest whatsoever in this, please don’t hesitate to comment and/or PM me. I will respond to **everyone** eventually.",21,1576976810,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/edy904/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/,IAmA,1

edqnzw,Laughterforever,I am an artist with full aphantasia ask me anything,"Hi I am Laughter, 

Im a young artist and I recently found out I have full aphantasia 

aphantasia is when you can't visualize, smell, hear, feel, or taste your anything in imagination. I can't do any of them so my imagination is just blank, I can imagine events with characters ect but its just like a blank its just like a story, a sequence of events no images not sounds ect. 

I have been an artist from as long as I can remember I love drawing what's around me but I find it hard to make a new scenes and make new things.

Ask me anything

The answer is both.

edejih,AJC-DataJournalist,"I’m the Atlanta Journal Constitution data journalist behind the analysis estimating that 54,000-85,000 Georgia voters didn’t vote on Election Day last year because of their distance to the polls. Ask me anything!","Hey, I’m Nick Thieme of the Atlanta Journal Constitution’s data team.

I used data from publicly available voter registration lists provided by the Georgia Secretary of State, economic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Georgia General Assembly’s digital maps of voting precincts to estimate the number of people who didn't vote because of their distance to their polling place.

I looked at data before and after the Supreme Court’s Shelby v. Holder decision (which gutted an important part of the Voting Rights Act, protecting minorities in certain primarily Southern states from discriminatory electoral changes), finding that distance didn't really play a part before the decision, but played a large part after.

As Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her dissenting opinion in that case, “throwing out preclearance \[the Voting Rights Act section ruled unconstitutional\] when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.” Our analysis measures the force of the rain.

ede7ob,Proper-Catch,I am in need of advice I'm quite confused regarding my assault,"When I was about ten I was held down and penetrated by a person 10 years older than me and it was sort of like a wrestling match and it was done in amusement but I really didn't expect it and I felt very violated.

But it felt really good (it was only a partial penetration) before this I never had any homosexual thoughts whatsoever in fact I was very attracted to women even at ten years old...

After this happened I started to become curious how someone could enjoy anal sex so I experimented with myself and was able to understand how it could be enjoyable even though I was not able to get any enjoyment in my self play.

But I would constantly ever since that night fantasize about being  raped but I was certainly not gay... I could never imagine having a relationship with a man or kissing a man I just wanted to get raped(in a not so rough manner)... Because of how good it felt that one time.

It has effected me quite a bit but I don't really hold resentment towards that person because I genuinely believe he thought it was some sort of a prank!...

But I really hate that I don't feel sexually fulfilled, I enjoy sex with women but I always have it at the back of my mind that I really want to be penetrated by a man  but nothing further than that.

I've been in love with many girls and never had any feelings for any guys whatsoever I don't believe I'm gay at all... I guess that might sound weird to someone hearing this but it entirely disgusts me the idea of kissing a man or being intimate with a man.

It's not a big problem in my life I just wish it had never happened because I wouldn't be plagued with these thoughts of homosexual sex",1,1576867667,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ede7ob/i_am_in_need_of_advice_im_quite_confused/,IAmA,1

My gang was founded by me and a few friends in our early teens, it lasted ten years and while some members are still some of my good friends the gang is now defunct. We were a small time street gang that had about 25 members over the years of operation. We were not connected to any larger gangs, we were not involved in any killings, we did not peddle hard drugs and we did not terrorize our neighbourhood. We were formed in response to neighbouring suburb's gangs terrorising our community and were at constant war with them for a decade, there was lots of drama, politics, peace treaties, broken peace treaties and bloodshed. While we were involved in criminal activity the aim of our gang was to protect eachother and the families of our neighbourhood from the reckless criminals of other gangs. Some people in our community thought we were idiots and aa problem while most respected and commended what we did.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello y'all, I'm a Taiwanese-Canadian with many interests, as seen in the title, in which I will now elaborate upon. :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instrument Maker:**

I specialize in making indigenous Taiwanese instruments, but I have also done some experimentation with other instruments from first-nations around the world. If you want so see some here's a [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa7fGThqnS_WdTdYPqUuHnb-EfzK48Qhf) (note: this does not include all the instruments I've made).

**Choral Singer:**

Proud singer in \[not gonna give away location that easily\], where I sing Bass (fun fact: a while back we got to sing on stage with [Dodie Clark](https://youtu.be/tyMfKuw0IQM)). I also sing in my school's concert choir &amp; chamber choir where I sing Tenor.

**Instrumentalist:**

I'm a player of all of the aforementioned indigenous Taiwanese instruments, but I also play piano, oboe, ukulele, and I've also began to [learn guitar](https://youtu.be/-fAvs9HRS0M).

**Bowyer &amp; Archer:**

I have 3 years of bow making experience (I've also in the past made atlatls), having made many bows out of bamboo, cedar, willow, and vine maple. I've just begun practicing shooting in the [style of the Siraya](https://youtu.be/epWc-4CT6EA) tribe from ancient times.

**Beginner Songwriter:**

I've just begun to write my own songs, both in the Siraya language and English, so far I've not recorded any of the English songs I've written, but I have written a song in the Siraya language that we performed in school concert choir (I'm not allowed to upload that performance but I did a recording of the song while sick and stuck in my room [here](https://youtu.be/rbJrsXagjlg)).

**Siraya Language Student:**

I'm currently learning the Siraya language, an indigenous Taiwanese language that had been extinct for about 100 years, and has just recently been brought back from old texts left behind by the Dutch.

ecwrai,doctordanish123,"AMA - 19M, From living with abusive parents, developing ptsd, being suicidal, towards a new start.","I'm a current international medical student, in my 3rd year, here in a Ukraine far away from home, and I've been having panic attacks since my mental breakdown at my entrance exam preparation.

My childhood hasn't been great. Life's been tough. My parents, they have had a troubled marriage, and their starting years left me with mental scars which might perhaps take years to heal.

To run away from the physical and mental abuse at home, and at the hands of my relatives who were against my parents relationship and who considered me a result of an illegitimate relationship, treated me like I was less than a human, I was always on the run for things which helped escape the dreadful reality I had at hand, and science, honestly filled my heart with Love and joy.

I never knew what a stable relationship was. I had to console my mum right by the moment I gained the ability to talk. Filling in my dads presence by devoting myself emotionally to my mum, I stayed emotionally drained, most of times, to even go out and explore any human contact.

I starting to go and work out things I love: tinkering around toys, then machines, trying to design things, making new machines, I felt the joy of being able to imagine. Those were one of the best moments of my life.

Every other day, when they couldn't bother to use their mouth to speak of things clearly, they'd make a way out in physically causing me pain, thinking that would make me understand things they couldn't perhaps speak of.

They'd hit me with anything they'd find, and by the time I was able to go to school, I was so scared of being physically assaulted that I was an easy target for bullies, getting repeatedly bullied at both home and school, the trauma that period caused me, combined with no sense of belonging, being regularly told by my parents that I was the reason their life were so fucked, made me gone more into this protective shell where I'd shut down

There was an instance when student smashed my head against the bench, pressed it, and stood there, until the teacher came. And the worst part of this is, I didn't cry. And the teacher punished both of us.

My dad always made it clear that I wasn't the son he wanted, in his actions and words, he'd prefer my cousin over me, and when I was too afraid to go on a ride at an amusement park, he grabbed my hand, forcibly took hold of me, and rushed back to home.

He'd make me feel I wasn't what he wanted, I was more feminine in my actions. And thereby, the word he'd use to taunt me and call me out, was, as you'd expect ""gay"". I never knew why he did that, perhaps, he felt homosexuality was a disgrace.

My mum was emotionally very unstable, one moment hitting me until she was tired, and other second calling me in and telling me that it was my fault, that she hit me.

And this kept happening, until my other siblings were born, 7 years.

And then, things go worse. Well. I could never say my parents ever loved me. Maybe we both have different definitions of love. They think it's controlling something to the point where it becomes your personal stress buster, which, when you hit, should come back to you with words of love and affection, and that isn't something I really agree with.

Perhaps, it was just my past and I should leave it there.

However, my mind, on an physiological level, is getting triggering by this, and other factors, sometimes random, unless expressed properly, which led me into these high intensity panic attacks, which suck the life out of me. I have flashbacks, and it seems life is being sucked out of me. My blood pressure increases tremendously, my pulse rises, I can feel my heart beating against my chest so fast that it aches. My hands turn cold, and I, in a deep state of pain and sorrow, try to rush from the spot, to a place of refuge.

However, most of these attempts are futile, as I fall unconsciously, breathless, with hypoxia, a kinda of semiparalysis, a state of life which usually makes me conclude that death is better than life.

And with it comes the social awkwardness.

I was really happy to be out here, away from my family finally, in a new place, as a new start, without any bondages, except one, of the tuition fees they paid. But alas, my dreams were crushed that night, when I was having a dinner with my friends. I was texting my then girlfriend, and my relationship with her was at a breaking point, and suddenly, my mind gets all filled up with these series of thoughts, unknown memories of traumas of my past, me being breathless, and falling into the lap of a friend, at the dinning table, who then carefully took me back to my room, making it seem that I was okay.

That was the day that changed my life entirely.

I tried talking about this to my parents. They deflected, rejected, disdained, and disowned all and every of my accusation, gaslighting every path of story which I had live through, comparing my understanding with that of an ungrateful brat, who was just acting around the whole time, as one professor dubbed me ""an attentionseeker"". I felt I was dying. Come on.

I went back to my country, had myself checked in at this shithead of a doctor, who somehow managed to make the situation worse, making my parents believe that I was just having general anxiety, with an overly exhausting predicting of my future, which, said, was not a good one to invest, and this was based on a 3 minute talk I had with him in absence of my parents. Basically, he diagnosed me with being an ""asshole"".

Wow. Seriously. Thanks doc. I hope you find happiness when you have dinner at night, surrounded by the knowledge that you purposely, made my already fumed situation, even worse.

They concluded they wouldn't send me back to the college.

For weeks, they had me in front of them, 14 hours a day, where they'd say something, followed by, ""why doesn't this trigger you?"" and ""why don't you do your panic attack thing now?""

However, luckily they went in for a second opinion. This time, the doc who initially said she'd talk to me for half an hour, took 6 hours out of her time, and called on the previous doc as a fraud.

However, I was given neither a proper treatment, nor medication to deal with myself. This was two years ago.

I was send back in here, and I kept suffering, until the point where I actively started avoiding everything which triggered me.

Three months back, I realised that my life was reduced to nothing. I didn't do a thing I loved. And if I tried, I'd have a panic attack, and it'd fuck me for the next few months until I actively refrain from triggers. I couldn't study, do my projects, read about things I love, paint, write my novels, maintain basic hygiene, couldn't sit through a movie without getting in a depressed state.

And two months from now, I had a relapse. After being clean for an year. I had a relapse.

I was devastated. I wanted to kill myself.

I spend a week alone. Not sleeping, not eating food, not doing anything, just trying not to have a panic attack.

When I went to class the next week, a teacher told me that ""this is your problem. And if you ever present this diagnosis(which said I was suffering from ptsd) anywhere in this university, I'll make sure your name lands in the expel list""

I didn't speak a word for the next couple of hours.

Next day, this other teacher saw me being inattentive at class, and asked me to meet her after class.

When I got there, she asked me everything, and listened, and gave me contacts for a psychologist friend of hers.

I hadn't had slept for more than 4 hours on average everyday for a month, by the time this happened.

But I didn't know how to get this done, I didn't have the money to pay the doctor, my parents concluded a long time ago that I was okay, and when I confronted them, they said they ""don't believe in mental illness"".

By the end of day, I got home, and found something that changed this entire thing upside down

There was a junior student, who had heard of me, and wanted me to tutor him, and said he'd pay me well.

And thankfully, I got to the doctor, she helped me a lot, and set me a therapy, for the next seven months.

I'm about to start my second month. I've been sleeping better. My panic attacks are still really too much to deal with, but the intensity is slightly lesser, and at least I know this can get better.

ecupsk,TruPotency_Science,"Less than 30% of CBD products are accurately labeled. IAMA neuroscientist using third party, independent lab testing to find high-quality CBD products. Let’s chat about what CBD is good for, what it’s not good for, and everything in between. AMA.","What is CBD? Will CBD get me high? Is CBD addictive? How much CBD do I take? What is CBD good for? I answer these questions among others every day.

The CBD market has exploded. With the CBD boom, snake oil merchants armed with misinformation and lack of regulation have saturated the market of the popular cannabinoid. It can be confusing or even scary for people to find legitimate information and products. Not everyone knows that there are a lot of poor quality CBD products in the market. [A 2017 study published in JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2661569) suggests only about 30% of CBD products are labeled accurately. We have done our own 3rd party blind testing on close to 400 products and only about 20% have been labeled accurately, meaning they failed for being within 10%+/- of the labeled amount of cannabinoids, had ingredients they shouldn’t have, or didn’t have ingredients they claimed to have. 

Some people know a lot about CBD and other related compounds, but there are many people who still have basic questions. After presenting and getting some great questions during a CBD panel at the [AZ Plant Medicine Conference](https://plantmedicineconference.com/austin-flohrschutz/), we thought we could share in the holiday spirit of giving to disseminate quality information to the community. I am Austin Flohrschutz AMA about CBD!

*My education: BS in Behavioral Neuroscience and MS in Neuroscience (recently decided to leave a PhD program in Neuroscience with an MS degree to become Director of Science for a science-led CBD company). As an undergraduate, I worked in a medicinal chemistry lab focused on extracting biologically active compounds from plants (Salvia divinorum), which were then purified and used to synthesize new potential drugs to treat pain without addictive properties. While in graduate school I worked in a neuropharmacology lab focused on pain, opioids, addiction, and cannabinoids. At my current organization we formed a board of some pre-eminent cannabinoid researchers who sit on our Science Advisory Board that I collaborate with, including:

*Todd Vanderah, PhD in Pharmacology - Head and Professor of Pharmacology, and is a Professor in the Departments of Neurology and Anesthesiology at The University of Arizona, College of Medicine. His research interests include mechanisms of cancer pain, neuronal integration in pain pathways, neurochemical release during conditions of neuropathy, neuronal plasticity, addiction, cannabinoid &amp; opioid receptor pharmacology, as well as the discovery of novel targets for new medications.

*Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD is Professor and Interim Chair of Dermatology and serves as Residency Program Director, Director of Translational Research, and Director of the Supportive Oncodermatology Program in the Department of Dermatology at The George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences. Dr. Friedman is investigating novel nanotechnologies that allow for advanced delivery of a wide spectrum of medicinally relevant molecules, such as cannabinoids, with an emphasis on treating infectious diseases, accelerating wound healing, immune modulation, and correcting vascular dysfunction.

*Dr. Hope Jones is Chief Scientific Officer of Emergent Cannabis Sciences -- an advising company driving scientific innovation within the cannabis industry -- and CEO and founder of Adivina Crop Science -- offering state of the art cannabis tissue culture and micropropagation services. Dr. Jones' previously worked as a Staff Scientist for NASA’s Life Sciences and Biosystems Engineering Program, where she was responsible for micropropagation production of crops, phytochemical research, and developing growing system technologies for deep space missions. 

Note: Our science advisory board is currently busy today with work and teaching, so they will help answer questions over the next 24 hours or so through this shared account.

The company I work for is called [TruPotency.com](https://www.trupotency.com/). I and the other science advisors joined this company because we’re philosophically aligned with their mission of blind 3rd party testing every product to ensure they’re properly labeled and safe for use. We also upload our lab results to every product page. Lastly, we display cannabinoid and terpene profiles on every product page in an easy way to digest. We sincerely hope you find this useful.

eceaow,PaulGuzzo,I'm the Florida reporter whose unearthing of Tampa's 1st all-black cemetery led to finding more lost burial sites,"Hey, I'm Paul Guzzo, a reporter for the *Tampa Bay Times*. This summer, I [**discovered Zion Cemetery**](https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/06/23/nearly-400-people-buried-in-tampa-are-missing-what-happened-to-zion-cemetery/), Tampa's first all-black cemetery that was erased from city history. (Excited to be back for [**another AMA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ccb439/were_the_florida_reporters_who_discovered_that_up/%20https://www.tampabay.com/topics/zion/)). 

That report sparked official searches for Zion's 800 bodies. It also caused the city and community to discuss how to best honor the dead, including closing the housing complex built on top. Ancestors demanded answers. State legislators drafted bills. It has been an [emotional time](https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2019/12/17/in-zion-cemeterys-lost-history-a-glimpse-of-the-memorial-park-it-could-become-again/).

I [quickly found](http://tampabay.com/zion) Zion wasn't the only cemetery to meet that fate. Most have been the final resting places for African Americans.

My reporting led to radar finding a [paupers cemetery](https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/25/buried-as-paupers-then-forgotten-their-resting-place-became-king-high/) under a Tampa high school. Records show there could be a cemetery [lost within another](https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/11/11/college-hill-might-be-a-cemetery-lost-within-another-cemetery/) Tampa cemetery, a cemetery hidden under an [empty lot](https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2019/12/13/records-say-a-cemetery-in-clearwater-was-moved-the-naacp-wants-to-be-sure/) in Clearwater, a cemetery under [MacDill Air Force Base](https://www.tampabay.com/news/hillsborough/2019/11/20/records-indicate-a-forgotten-black-cemetery-might-lie-beneath-macdill-air-force-base/). A [history museum's staffers](https://www.tampabay.com/news/hernando/2019/12/12/hernando-museum-is-haunted-staff-says-now-theyre-looking-for-a-cemetery-there/) are among people looking into hunches.

ec568g,rudolphblue,A broken heart :(,"I am an idiot. I fell for this girl that I knew would never like me back. We started talking a lot on discord where my friends found out I liked her. One of my friends decided to tell her, and this is where it all went downhill. At first everything seemed fine. I talked to her every day until scary late hours and really vibed with her. All of the sudden we started fighting every day. It became a cycle. I would text her for a while, and then say something she didn’t like leadings to us fighting and ending the cycle by apologizing. I was really protective of her. I had friends that would be dicks and I would stand up for her. This started giving me nicknames like “White Knight” and “Horny Ninja.” Me and this girl never really talked in person. I couldn’t work up the confidence to do it, and for some reason she just decided not to talk to me. My friends were dicks about this too. This girl and I decided to stay up really late on a Friday, and it all ended on this day. My mom hit me, hard. I was upset and needed to vent. I used this anger I had built up on her. Big. Fucking. Mistake. This girl was nothing but nice to me and I messed it up. I told her she only talked to me for attention and that she moves on from boy to boy playing them. I don’t know why I said this I was just confused and hurt and mad. She just called herself my last resort, like I looked to talk to others before her. She was my number one priority, and I was always so happy to text her and just talk. We did the usual apolologizing the Saturday after this big fight, but it was all off. She lost the little flame she had texting her. She became more dry and less eager to talk to me. I knew I was losing her. I confront her about it. She told me the comment I made on Friday messed it up, and called like all the other guys. I begged her to let me repair it all, to start over, and she declined. I told her I need her. I let her know how special she is and how I understand I messed up. I was willing to change. “We’re good.” She told me we were good. I thought maybe we could restart and things could get better. I was wrong. Back on discord, my friend messed up the server and in retaliation me and this girl created a new one. I made it for her. I also thought it would be a good idea to ruin his server completely so people had to come to ours. In doing this, I lost my friend and he retaliated by exposing everything I’ve done for the girl and how it’s creepy and I can’t be normal around her. She agreed with him and blew up on me, yelling at me for “not acting normal around her.” She told me she never liked me, and never would. She told me I would never have a chance with her. She also told me to stop texting her completely. Here I sit, alone, still in love with this girl who I’m not even allowed to text.

I’m going to get out of the way the two most obvious questions.

1. How did I become homeless?
I quit my job thinking I would be able to pay my rent in a room. My side hustle as a mover proved to be less profitable then expected, and I couldn’t come up with November’s rent, so I became homeless. I have a bad relationship with my parents, and cut all my friends off over a year ago due to depression and realized they are not actual friends, so I have nobody to help me. I want to do this AMA to expose light on the homeless lifestyle, not make it about me, although I will still answer personal questions.

Most obvious question Is how I’m on the internet with a smart phone, so I will link you this post I made to answer that. It’s harshly worded but it’s the truth. If you think I should be selling my smart phone and never has internet time... please read this: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeless/comments/dxequv/you_have_an_iphone_5_a_20_watch_headphones_and_a/

\---

I’m Lucas Richert, the historical director for the [American Institute of the History of Pharmacy](https://aihp.org/) at UW-Madison, a nearly 80-year-old institute dedicated to advancing the knowledge and understanding of the history of pharmacy and medicines. I’m also co-editor in chief of [Social History of Alcohol and Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/journals/shad/pr/180921) and author of a new book with the MIT Press called “[Break On Through](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262042827/),” which draws on archives and government documents, medical journals, and interviews, and interweaves references to pop (counter)culture to historicize the radical mental health practices in the 1960s and 70s. I published another book (“[Strange Trips](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Trips-Regulation-McGill-Queens-Associated/dp/0773556370)”) earlier this year that focuses on the contentious relationship between scientific knowledge, cultural assumptions, and social concerns. My hope — particularly with “Break On Through” — is to promote the discussion of mental health by placing the histories of American mental health, pharmaceutical use, and intoxicant use in dialogue with one another, all within the context of mainstream and fringe therapies.

Questions about the history of drugs or pharmaceuticals? The field of psychiatry in the 1960s and 70s? Over the past few years, I've written and taught about how and why we control and regulate drugs in CANADA and the US. And I've tried to understand the major swings and struggles in modern mental health care. I’m here from 1 – 3 PM EST — ask me anything!

Our reporting found that these emotionally disturbed children often have easy access to guns at home and are protected by state and federal disability laws. Ask us anything about today’s schools and a generation of children at risk.

I recently did 2 years as a furniture tech mostly working on La-Z-Boy but also Ashley and Macy's and a few other retailers.  I've got about 6 years of experience detailing in a wide variety of settings from private detailing, to mobile work, body shops, and even some high end clients.  (I used to clean Miranda Lambert's vehicles every two weeks when I lived in Nashville and the same company I worked for also did Peter Frampton's car).  It occurs to me that people might have a lot of questions about both of these fields as they are shrouded in a bit of mystery and a little bit of scam-artistry as well.



So ask me anything that's on your mind!  Whether it's about maintenance of furniture or cars, my experiences in those fields, or anything even tangentially related!  I'll answer anything I can.

**My Proof:** [ La-Z-Boy manual](https://i.imgur.com/WC7gFeU.jpg), [ID badge](https://i.imgur.com/hUuPlE6.jpg).

I've written about [U.S. farms that recruit Mexican veterinarians with offers of professional work but then they put them to work milking and cleaning barns for low pay](https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/special-reports/dairy-crisis/2019/12/04/mexican-veterinarians-recruited-by-american-farms-high-skill-end-up-low-skill-jobs-milking-cleaning/4312237002/).  I have also been reporting on Florida [cosmetic surgery clinics](https://www.naplesnews.com/in-depth/news/special-reports/2019/01/30/miami-doctors-plastic-surgery-empire-becomes-floridas-deadliest-clinics/2462068002/) that left [dozens of patients death](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/22/felons-opened-plastic-surgery-businesses-where-women-died/3501970002/) or  injured. Most of the deaths were of Hispanic and African American women.

I'm [Marisa Kwiatkowski](https://twitter.com/IndyMarisaK), and I’ve been handling investigations for more than a decade, most recently as part of [USA TODAY's national investigative team](https://www.usatoday.com/staff/mkwiatko/marisa-kwiatkowski/). Much of my work has been focused on issues affecting children and vulnerable adults.

Our most recent USA TODAY investigation examined the prevalence and impact of a Florida law that allows doctors to opt out of carrying medical malpractice insurance. Maria and I would love to share how we and our colleagues did it.

ebf3sh,Reikyabiku,"Hi Everyone! Just got terminated, I'm in -50k debt and only 25. Ask me anything.","Hi guys,  


my name is Paul u/reikyabiku and my life is falling apart.  
So today I went to work normaly. We have feedback meetings at the end of each year and this was my first and last one. I was working with the company for 3 years and I didn't have these meetings the 2 years prior because the department just didn't do them. I ""kinda"" switched departments last year because there was no work for me in my last department.  


The reason I got terminated is a security breach. Sounds big; isn't.  
It's normal for our department to keep old hardware, but the Head of department needs to be asked first. Let this be either mail or we personally ask. In the past it worked all fine, colleagues all keep their old hardware when they get new stuff. - pretty simple so far.  


The time comes around and I'm about to get new hardware. Of course I go ahead and ask if I can keep my old Laptop to which the Head said ""yes, sure"" (it never was a problem, he'd never say ""no"" he just wanted to be informed).  


So now it's 2 months later and I got terminated because he says: no i never allowed that. I wasn't informed.  


So now I'm sitting here, -50k in debt, don't know how to pay rent or bills, no savings. I'm pretty much screwed.

Ofc I'm already working on new applications.

&amp;#x200B;

I require you to make contact with my Nigerian militry, informing them of this continued torture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am keeping a copy of this and many other emails, as to present it to the Oba of Benin, and Kings in Esan, as to ascertain as to why our people are not responding to my emails for help.

Again I am being tortured, and I need it to stop.

 

I hope to hear from you, or our internal defence people, hopefully soon.

I aim to create at the very least 60 kits and once the assembly portion of my project has been completed I will be delivering them to my local food bank for any children this year in need, and the children of the 2020-2021 school year. I am advertising on Reddit looking for donations and support in my project. I am not looking for monetary donations, only school supplies. My kits will be created around the average needs of a elementary school student. The kits will include backpacks, crayons, colored pencils, pens, pencils, pencil pouches, binders, notebooks, folders, etc. 

If you are interested in making a donation and supporting me in my project you can contact me via direct messages on Reddit, replying to this post saying you are interested and i will send you a message, or you can email me at kaibowen1222@gmail.com.

Again as a reminder, I will not accept money as a form of donation. The donations don't have to be new or in perfect condition, as long as they are fit and can be used properly and with ease by an elementary student. Any used donations will happily be accepted.

 Anyway my real name is Casey Cornelis. I am 16 years old and have Autism as well as ADHD. I live in a small town in Southern New England (not saying where don't want to dox myself) I can act somewhat normal and can usually hold a normal conversation with a lot of people. People call me ""a walking Wikipedia"" (at least my boomer parents and teachers do). I am somewhat of an introvert especially around women since I have tried and failed time and time again to get a gf in both middle school and highschool. I am not in school at the moment due to certain reasons but I am planning on going to a very small highschool for high functioning autistic kids like myself and the school has a population of about 20-30 students all of them teenage boys so sadly no GF opportunities. I am currently going through a turbulent time in my life due to my autism causing me to do some bullshit out of poor impulse control that has landed me in legal trouble. I can reveal it somewhat but not to much due to legal reasons and other things. I sometimes don't keep shit to myself and accidentally say the wrong thing in public or make a dirty joke with my mother. I see my autism as my greatest strength and greatest weakness. I can see parts of the world differently from other people but the fact that I'm isolated from the regular kids in my neighborhood and elsewhere makes me feel alone and the fact that my autism makes me do stupid things makes me feel like I was born wrong. Like every gen z teenager I think about killing myself but im to much of a pussy to do it and I know that people love and care about me even if I wish more people did especially on my own youtube channel which I won't get into because Im not trying to advertise it or anything. the fact that my channel only has about 100 subs and that most of my videos get next to no views makes me feel worthless sometimes. I will get into detail about my channel if anyone asks me about it. 
I would put this on r/teenagers if I wasn't a lurker on that sub which means that i'm not a ""person of interest in the community"" and it is likely I fucked up on something lol so hooray for my first AMA which I likely butchered
I am only 16 and I don't really know where I can find records for myself lol so the best proof I have is an obituary of my grandfather with my name mentioned in it as well as my twitter account (not advertising its just the best proof I have at this point)

eal8km,BeingsBeingBeings,IamA new mod with 1 year of experience starting a subreddit &amp; using Mod Tools. AMA!,"I spent more than a year trying to figure out how to get people to join my community. It only has 177 members, so I'm still not a Reddit expert.  But I'm super-excited that people are joining and submitting text posts, now.  

&amp;#x200B;

My knowledge about how to start a subreddit and use Mod Tools is still limited, but it's recent.  I learned how to moderate using the new design &amp; updated mod tools.  I hope these ideas will be useful for someone who is thinking about starting a subreddit, and maybe some experienced mods will join the discussion and help make this thread more useful than I could make it on my own.    


**First, I had to** ***decide*** **what I wanted people to do.**   
When I started my subreddit, I didn't have a clear vision for what I wanted people to \*do\*.  My mistake was that I was thinking about it like a blog -- a place where I would create content about the topic I know best.  But a discussion forum is all about content I want \*other\* people to create.     


What, exactly, do I want people to do? AskReddit is a place for questions and answers.  IamA is a place where people can be interviewed. ShittyLifeProTips is a place for funny bad advice.  ForHire is a place where people can hire one another.  The creators of these communities make it clear what they want people to do. 

1.) Will it be a serious subreddit, or will it be a funny/not-so-serious subreddit?   
2.) Do I want to allow only link posts, only text posts, or both?   
3.) What. Do. I. Want. People. To. Do!?

I started to figure out what I wanted people to do when I was learning to use the mod tools. The mod tools are all about narrowing your focus to give clear definition to your subreddit.   

&amp;#x200B;

**Next, I had to** ***show*** **people what I wanted them to do.**    
I started submitting text posts that were examples of the kinds of text posts I want other people to submit.  I started formulating the post titles in the way I wanted other people to formulate post titles.  By filling the subreddit with examples of the kinds of posts I want other people to submit, I was showing people what to do.    
That's when I started to realize where my focus should be.  No matter what I want my subreddit to be about, the thing I want people to \*do\* is: submit a text post!  If nobody has a reason to submit text posts, then what am I even doing here?    
**Finally, I needed to** ***give people a reason*** **to submit text posts.**  
Why would anyone want to join my small, shitty little subreddit and spend time to submit a text post?  There's probably a similar subreddit that has a lot more activity, so people are going to go there instead.    After 11 months of not getting anywhere, I realized how difficult it is to create a subreddit where people will actually \*want\* to submit text posts.      
Seems obvious, but this was a breakthrough for me.  I needed a way to get people interested in participating in my community even though it was still nearly empty.  My strategy was to offer something for free.  Since my subreddit is a writing service, I decide to to offer free writing and editing to help people improve their most important text content.   


1. Anyone could submit a text post and get some free writing or editing service (Anyone who is trying to improve their English or improve their professional bio, or create their own brand, can get help to improve their most important text content).  
2. Professional writers can also submit text posts to share ideas with potential customers (i.e. so they can maybe connect with some new clients).  So, writers and the people who hire them both have a reason to submit a text post in my subreddit. 

For me, this was the big lesson.  I spent so much time thinking about what kind of community I wanted to create, I never spent enough time thinking about the activity that would happen there.  To start a community that has a chance of getting off the ground, it's necessary to take an approach that is based on finding a way to make Reddit users *want* to submit posts.    


You can let me know if you'd like to collaborate with me and get some ideas about how to start your own subreddit or personal brand. Like I said, I'm not a Reddit expert, but I'm definitely willing to spend time collaborating with you and thinking about how to popularize the kind of subreddit you want to create.

We are HealthSherpa, experts on the ACA / ""Obamacare"" and have helped 3 million people enroll since 2014. This year, 1 in 5 people signing up in Healthcare.gov states are enrolling through our site - that's 1 million people since Nov. 1. Our site (HealthSherpa.com) shows all the same options at the same prices as the government site (Healthcare.gov), with no biased sorting or other shenanigans. 

You can also submit a Medicaid application on our site if you are in one of the following states: AL, AK, AZ, AR, DE, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MI, MS, MO, MT, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, VA, WA, WV, WI, WY. Note that Sunday's deadline doesn't apply if you are Medicaid eligible.

These states have later deadlines and their own state exchanges. If you are in one of these states, you should go directly to the state exchange linked below: 

CA - 1/31: www.coveredca.com
CO - 1/15: www.connectforhealthco.com

NY - 1/31: nystateofhealth.ny.gov

The following states still have individual mandates that mean if you go uninsured in 2020, you may pay a fine: 
CA, NJ, DC, MA, RI. There is no fine for not having health insurance in other states.

Anything we tell you about plans on our site is also true for plans on Healthcare.gov, so you should use whatever you are most comfortable with - what's important is that you don't miss the deadline!

ea93ik,Prolificvisions,"IamA Its been 3 years since I almost died from the swine flu, and it's been a semi rough road. I am just getting out of the hospital from diastolic heart failure, and I'm expected to keep on living! AMA!","**My short bio:** in April 2016, I ended up with the swine flu, which led to an induced coma for a month and a half. I was on ECMO, which works as an external lung, for 2 weeks. My lungs were badly damaged, which they ended up diagnosing as interstitial lung disease. Besides a higher heart rate, when I do minimal things, i.e., going from my car to the house, my life was back to normal. I redid a semester of college, got a great paying job. Fastfoward to December 5th, and out of no where I started getting this racing heart rate, that just wouldnt go down. I went to work Friday, and it just wouldnt go down, so Saturday I went into the hospital. They did a catheterization on Monday, and found out that there was a lot of fluid and pressure on the right side of my heart, which lead to the first diagnoses of Pulmonary Hypertension. They put me on high doses of lasix to bring down the fluid retention which severely helped the heart rate and the constant wheezing and coughing I'd been experiencing. Well they brought down the heart rate, significantly, prescribed me heart medicine and lasix to take until further notice. I am to follow up with Penn Presbyterian in Philadelphia because they specialize in the problem I have, and they will be able to help me further.

ea6jdw,Em4Ga106,"My name is Emily Leslie and I’m the Democrat running for State House District 106, the most flippable seat in Georgia. I’m running against a Trump/Kemp loyalist who hasn’t had to face a challenger in a decade, until now. AMA.","In 2018 I ran the most successful write-in campaign in State History. The incumbent Republican received less than two-thirds of ballots cast, in a district where Stacey Abrams won by a significant margin.

I stepped up to run as an emergency write-in candidate, to ensure that the voters had a choice - after the democratic candidate ( unexpectedly) chose not file for the seat. I am running to ensure that our community has a representative that reflects its values, and will focus on the needs of the people.

I’m a 36- year-old mother of two children, and a mental health/addiction recovery specialist, who previously worked as a legislative coordinator and human rights lobbyist. I used my leadership role in a well-known progressive organization to secure a national focus on Gwinnett County’s state and local electoral races. I’m currently a leader in the Gwinnett County Democratic Party.

Georgia Republicans, including the incumbent Representative, continue to pursue a divisive and harmful path for our state and for Snellville, such as the six-week abortion ban. I will work to pass legislation that explicitly prohibits racial profiling by state, county, and local law enforcement agencies.

I will continue to advocate for people living with disabilities as well as healthcare for every Georgian and enhanced mental health and addiction recovery services. Peer-Run facilities need to have a presence in every city in Georgia. I support investing in transportation and infrastructure, including mass transit. I believe in strengthening our economy for the working and middle class, common sense gun reform, legalizing marijuana, clean energy--and voter protection and voting rights reforms that will ensure Georgians can have confidence in our elections.

ea6g2a,MasterPpv,"I am a programmer for a state university research lab, a music, event and portrait photographer, a lifelong gamer both competitively and non, and a beginner streamer. Ask me anything!","Hiya! I’m a programmer by trade; I work at a research lab at a state university and graduated with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science just a few years ago.

However, I have also been a photographer since high school - starting with shooting sports and various high school events, doing some photojournalism work, and eventually becoming a music photographer. These days, I do still shoot music, but have also started shooting other events and doing portrait and lifestyle work.

Additionally, I have also been a gamer for pretty much my entire life. From an early age I learned to work the computer in my dad’s home office and play games on it, so he eventually set up his old computer for me to use (Windows 95, black &amp; white monitor, but it was my baby from then on). While most games I play just for the fun of it (and have aspirations of going into game development), I have also taken some games more seriously and competitively, namely Super Smash Bros. Melee, TF2, and most recently, Overwatch. Not that I’ve ever been some top contender in any of these, but just know that I’m aware and part of their competitive scenes and that I have occasionally played other roles in the scenes as well, such as commentating, helping out with event organization, etc.

Proof of coding: My GitHub is somewhat barren and I need to dump a lot of my code from the last couple of year onto it, but there’s at least proof here that I code. Apologies for not having better proof of my actual job right now; I didn’t want to give away the exact place I work so I could at least keep a little bit of privacy. Anyway:

Maybe it’s just my personal experience, but I don’t know many people around my age (mid-20s) who have put as many hours as I have into multiple, vastly different things.

Good morning Reddit!

I am a 27 year old Thai/Aussie man who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder. I was unaware of what was happening with my life until earlier this year when I first stepped into a local GP to talk about my thoughts of suicide. This entire year has been devoted to figuring my way through it all. I have achieved a state of co-consciousness with my alters. I have told my partner, a few close friends, the members of my band and one close family member. I would like to answer questions to strangers as practice to face my family one day with this news.

What is DID? From wikipedia;

&gt;**Dissociative identity disorder** (**DID**), previously known as **multiple personality disorder** (**MPD**),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#cite_note-ICD10-7) is a [mental disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring [personality states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-3) This is accompanied by [memory gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_amnesia) beyond what would be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-3) The personalities alternately show in a person's behavior;[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#cite_note-DSM5-3) presentations, however, are variable.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#cite_note-Hersen2014-5) Other problems which often occur in people with DID include [borderline personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) (BPD), [posttraumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder) (PTSD), [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder), [substance use disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorders), [self-harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm), or [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety).

For the most part of our lives, we have been ""lying"" by pretending to be one person. Though not intentional, we would have to make up excuses as to why we did certain things in the past (taking blame for actions of alters) but we could not deny when the evidence is clear or we were seen by others doing something that was the action of another alter taking control of the body. From this point on, I will be typing from the perspective that I do not have to hide and so my terminology/vocabulary will change eg. I/we etc

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, my name is Hanu. Our system is named Perth. Perth is the biological name given to us and it is how the world knows us. I am what is known as a ""protector."" A Protector is the term used to define an alter that takes control of the body forcefully when the situation requires it. I am the alter that came into existence to protect our ""little"" alter from physical and psychological abuse when he was young. I have been in control of our system for several decades. I share protective duties with another alter named Tahan.

&amp;#x200B;

Sup reddit! I'm Tahan. I handle most social interactions because Hanu is a bit too formal for most people and our ""little"" truly does have the mind of a child so it is hard for him to talk to other adults. I'm happy to answer anything you'd like.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I am little Perthy :D This is very exciting \^\_\_\^

&amp;#x200B;

Hanu: I speak for all of us when we say we're happy to answer any and all questions so please feel free to ask any of us anything you like.

e9sax3,creep604,"Many missing people have nobody looking for them. I am Rob Sell, a search and rescue tracker, cybersecurity professional, and founder of TraceLabs.org, where volunteers compete to find clues to the whereabouts of missing people. AMA!","Hi Reddit! I'm Robert Sell, an information-security professional and 10 year volunteer with Coquitlam Search &amp; Rescue (SAR) in British Columbia, Canada where I specialize in tracking lost persons in the back country. This experience has allowed me to see first hand the impact missing persons has on society.

&amp;#x200B;

To put it in perspective: every day, over 2,500 Americans are reported missing. This includes both children and adults. This does not include Americans who have vanished in other countries, individuals who disappear and are never reported, or the homeless and their children.

&amp;#x200B;

In most jurisdictions, missing persons cases receive low priority. Authorities are already working homicides, robberies, rapes, assaults, traffic issues, and crime prevention.

&amp;#x200B;

In response to the lack of urgency, priority, and lack available resources to investigate these cases, I founded [TraceLabs.org](https://TraceLabs.org).

&amp;#x200B;

Trace Labs brings together computer experts and online sleuths to find clues to the whereabouts of missing people. We do this by hosting ""Capture the Flag"" style competitions at security conferences around the world like DEFCON and BSIDES, and through ongoing daily operations online.

&amp;#x200B;

Volunteers track down relevant publicly available information (otherwise known as Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT) for missing persons cases where the police have asked the public for help. We then turn over any information found to the police to aid in the investigations.

&amp;#x200B;

A recent Freethink video documenting our work has now been viewed over 3 million times: [https://www.freethink.com/videos/online-hackers-hunt-down-missing-people](https://www.freethink.com/videos/online-hackers-hunt-down-missing-people)

Ask us anything!","We are the [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)](https://maps.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit research and educational organization founded in 1986 that develops medical, legal, and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful uses of psychedelics and marijuana. For an introduction to our work, we invite you to watch MAPS Founder Rick Doblin, Ph.D., present the [first official TED Talk about psychedelics](https://www.ted.com/talks/rick_doblin_the_future_of_psychedelic_assisted_psychotherapy), filmed on the main stage at TED2019.

Our highest priority project is funding clinical trials of [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)](https://maps.org/research/mdma) as a tool to assist psychotherapy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). [Preliminary studies have shown](https://maps.org/resources/papers) that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can help people overcome PTSD, and possibly other disorders such as anxiety associated with life-threatening illness and social anxiety in autistic adults. In MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, MDMA is only administered a few times, unlike most medications for mental illnesses which are often taken daily for years, and sometimes forever. We also [study the therapeutic potential](https://maps.org/research) of LSD, ayahuasca, ibogaine, and medical marijuana.

On July 28, 2017, MAPS and the FDA reached agreement on the Special Protocol Assessment for [Phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/phase3) for PTSD. Participants will be randomized to receive three day-long sessions of either MDMA or placebo in conjunction with psychotherapy over a 12-week treatment period, along with 12 associated 90-minute non-drug preparatory and integration sessions. On August 16, 2017, [the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to MDMA](https://maps.org/breakthrough) for the treatment of PTSD. We are currently seeking research volunteers for Phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. For more information on study participation, please visit our website: [mdmaptsd.org](https://mdmaptsd.org/).

In addition to clinical research, we also sponsor the [Zendo Project](https://zendoproject.org/), a non-profit psychedelic peer support and harm reduction service that provides a supportive space with compassionate care for people undergoing difficult psychedelic experiences at festivals, concerts, and community events.

Now is a great time to become involved in supporting our work—[Donations to MAPS are currently being doubled $1-for-$1](https://www.razoo.com/us/story/Psychedelic-Dinners)!

e9p8s0,JackHEvans,"We're Florida journalists who revealed flaws in the Baker Act, a law used more often by police to take children from schools to be locked in mental health facilities","We’re Leonora LaPeter Anton, Megan Reeves and Jack Evans, reporters at the *Tampa Bay Times*. We recently published two reports ([here](https://www.tampabay.com/special-reports/2019/12/08/an-autistic-child-melts-down-an-officer-makes-a-decision-a-family-suffers-the-consequences/) and [here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2019/12/10/floridas-flawed-baker-act-rips-thousands-of-kids-from-school/)) in our Powerless series on Florida's Baker Act. The law was meant to help people in mental health crises, but our investigations revealed glaring flaws in its use on kids. 

More than 100 children a day across Florida end up at mental health facilities, and nearly 36,000 were transported last year. The state isn't even tracking its use at public schools, so we built a database. We found it's been applied at least 7,500 times in Tampa Bay's public schools since 2013, and probably far more. Most decisions were made by law enforcement with little training instead of mental health professionals. An expert says the Baker Act is abused statewide.

One disturbing aspect we learned: Parents and guardians often have no say. We spoke to families where autistic children ended up in police cruisers, despite their individualized education plans and no mental health diagnoses. Families say they were traumatized. Some facilities even put them in harm's way.

e9kc6w,za_snake_guy,"Hi Reddit, IamA wildlife photographer from Cape Town, South Africa, specializing in snakes, scorpions, and spiders - Ask Me Anything you've always wanted to know about snakes or other venomous animals.","I have been a trained &amp; permitted snake handler for a couple of years, using my free time to relocate wild snakes people find in their homes or businesses back to nature.

A year ago I got my first real camera (Nikon P1000) and took up wildlife photography, you can see my favourite photos of 2019 here:

* Part 1/3: [https://imgur.com/gallery/sOFQeC7](https://imgur.com/gallery/sOFQeC7)
* Part 2/3: [https://imgur.com/gallery/gWTisS9](https://imgur.com/gallery/gWTisS9)
* Part 3/3: [https://imgur.com/gallery/G2DtA0D](https://imgur.com/gallery/G2DtA0D)
* Several of my photos and videos are also posted on my /r/SnakeRescue subreddit.

For me, photography is a way of capturing natural scenes that won't ever exist again - animals in a certain pose, or reacting to a certain situation. Since many of my subjects are snakes, scorpions, spiders, and the like, photography is also a way for me to show people who might never see these animals in real life, what they look like and how they behave.

I try to submit data about the things I see to various research projects, and it's nice to think that someday in the future the small contributions I make might help advance science in some tiny way.

My favourite way of spending a Saturday morning is getting up early, going for a hike in a new place, taking pictures of what I see, then afterwards researching the species I hadn't encountered before.

It's therapeutic - not just because I'm out in the fresh air, getting exercise, and learning - but also because I often get a glimpse into a hidden world that others might just pass by.

e9c3vl,ufexplore,We are scientists at the UF Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research with 12 years of sea turtle biology and marine ecology experience between us. AMA!,"Hi Reddit!

We are Alexandra Gulick and Nerine Constant – PhD Candidates at the [Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research](https://accstr.ufl.edu/) and [Department of Biology](https://biology.ufl.edu/) at the University of Florida. Through our studies, we've traveled across the world to study sea turtles in their nesting and foraging habits.  With sea turtle populations rebounding, we are now exploring the question of sea turtle impact on seagrass beds.

In August, we returned from a research expedition to the Sargasso Sea as part of [Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole Expedition](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/21690/greenpeace-launches-pole-to-pole-expedition-in-bid-for-global-ocean-treaty/) to study thermal properties of floating mats of *Sargassum* algae. *Sargassum* mats are important developmental habitat for sea turtles, providing a place to hide from predators, find food, and grow. We evaluated whether these mats also provide a warmer environment than the neighboring open water, potentially increasing sea turtle growth rates.

Creating detailed thermal profiles of *Sargassum* mats will improve our understanding of the importance of this habitat, and in light of climate change, may help predict potential impacts of increasing sea surface temperature on the suitability of this habitat for sea turtles and other species.

We also hope this study and our collaboration with Greenpeace will help raise awareness of the importance of protecting the Sargasso Sea from threats like climate change and plastic pollution.

Since then, I have been fortunate to study sea turtles in their nesting and foraging habitats in Australia and the Caribbean. In the age of green turtle recovery and the global decline of seagrasses due to human-related threats, my PhD research focuses on the foraging and behavioral ecology of green turtles in seagrass ecosystems. I am currently evaluating the productivity of naturally grazed meadows and how seagrass ecology may influence grazing behavior. This work will provide valuable insight into the role and sustainability of increased grazing pressure on seagrass ecosystem function and develop ecosystem-based approaches to green turtle and seagrass conservation.

Nerine: I completed my BS in Biology at the University of Florida (2012) and my Master of Environmental Management with a Certificate in Geospatial Analysis at Duke University (2015). I have studied human impacts on sea turtle nesting beaches in Costa Rica and Cabo Verde, and more recently, effects of green turtles on seagrass ecosystem services. My PhD research focuses on responses of ecologically and economically important fish assemblages to green turtle grazing in Caribbean seagrass meadows. This work incorporates my broader interests, which include studying the roles of sea turtles in marine ecosystems and contributing to conservation efforts and sustainable management of coastal resources.

e9ad4n,uyghurrallynyc,I am Rushan Abbas - Uyghur Activist and survivor of Chinese oppression. My sister and my friends are currently trapped in western China's concentration camps. Ask me anything!,"Hi, I'm Rushan Abbas. I'm  one of the Uyghur People of central Asia, and the Chinese Government has locked up many of my friends and relatives in concentration camps. I'm trying to help bring the worlds attention to this issue, and to shine light on the horrific human rights abuses happening in Xinjiang. I'm the founder of the Campaign for Uyghurs, and I'm a full time activist who travels the world giving talks and connecting with other groups that have suffered from Chinese repression. I've worked with Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo bay and I've lived in numerous countries. I'm currently banned from China because of my political work. Today I'm being helped out by Uyghur Rally, a group of activists focused on demonstrations and campaigns around these issues in the United States. Ask Me Anything!

Since 2015, the Chinese Government has locked up millions of ethnic Uyghurs (and other Muslim minorities) in concentration camps, solely for their ethnic and religious identity. The ethnic homeland of the Uyghurs has become a hyper-militarized police state, with police stations on every block and millions of cameras. Cutting-edge technology is used to maximize the efficiency of this system, with facial recognition and biometric monitoring systems permeating every aspect of life in Xinjiang. This project is being orchestrated by the most senior officials in the Chinese government, and is nothing less than a full blown attempt to effectively eliminate the Uyghur people and culture from the face of the earth. This nightmare represents a profound violation of human rights on an industrial scale not seen since the second world war. They have gone to enormous lengths to hide the extent of this, but recent attention from investigative journalists and activists the eyes of the world have been turned on this atrocity.

e982va,LinaTherapistLPC,"Hi, I'm Lina from Counseling for Resilience, and I help people overcome stigma against mental health treatment. AMA","There are many reason why people suffer alone rather than seeing a therapist.  For example, they:

* may have been raised in a culture that frowns upon seeking help, or
* may not believe that mental health diagnoses are real, or
* lack trust in counseling/psychotherapy due to generations of abuse of power by the medical community, or
* think that people would be fine if they would put their trust in God to heal them, or
* have been told by others that they should just ""get over it"" and move on with their life, or
* they had a negative experience in counseling in the past and are scared to try again, or
* you just don't know how to find a counselor who would be a good fit for you.

As a therapist, I meet clients who suffered for years before coming to therapy.  Some of them used drugs or alcohol to manage their pain.  Some isolated themselves, and felt the walls closing in as their depression or anxiety grew worse.  Some used self-injurious behaviors or considered (or attempted) suicide when their pain became too much to manage.

I understand how difficult it can be to trust.  I had very disappointing experiences with therapists in the past, and even experienced some very unethical behavior by people I went to see.  Just like any other profession, ours has some duds.  

So many times, I have sat down with a client for an initial intake appointment and heard the words, ""I really should have done this a long time ago"".  I always suggest that when people are calling a therapist for an appointment that they ask the person on the phone: ""Tell me a little about your approach to counseling.""  This allows you to hear the professional describe how they work with clients and gives you a chance to get a feel for the professional, before you decide to schedule your first appointment.

If you have struggled with anxiety, depression, panic, childhood trauma, military trauma, perfectionism, relationship problems, poor self-image, addictions, racial/sexual/gender/ability/religious discrimination, what has held you back from seeking counseling?

e97k8n,presentperfects,"IAmA aerospace engineer who quit his well-paid job after 2 years out of boredom. I then developed a chatbot to help people discover gift ideas based on the recipient's personality, values, and interests because I thought it would make me feel more useful. It does. Here's my story, AMA!","Hello reddit! 

I meet more and more people who completely changed their lives for what seems to be less comfortable situations, but since I'm one of them, I'd like to share my story. So, excuse my French-English, and here it is: 

I've always wanted to be an aerospace engineer. I've always loved airplanes, became an RC pilot before I was 10 with my brother, then managed to become a glider pilot (for free!) at the age of 16 and then an ultralight pilot one year later. I was pretty creative and thought that I wouldn't be complete without creating and innovating so I decided not to be a professional pilot and to become an engineer instead, knowing that I could still fly gliders and ultralights. 

I studied hard for six years and became an aerospace engineer. Then I quickly got hired as a subcontractor for Airbus. And I very quickly got bored. The thing is, there's not much room for innovation when thousands of engineers work on the same huge project. That structure means that each individual engineer works on a tiny detail, optimizes it like crazy, but ultimately, the best you can get out of this is a better version of what you had before, not a revolution or a new vision on how to solve a problem (Because the way the tasks are allocated is based on the way we made the previous airplanes and what systems were in it). If you've ever wondered why airplanes have looked exactly the same for the past 40 years, that's why. Well, it's my opinion at least ;). 

It's been about a year since I quit that job. Since then, I've been looking for ways to feel more helpful. For example, my main project for the last months was to find an acceptable solution to gift-giving. I studied the psychology and science of it, and I came up with Leonard, a chatbot on Facebook Messenger who helps people discover unique gift ideas. It's a solution that feels natural, like speaking to a friend about what gift you could offer this Christmas, except there's a ton of maths and coding behind it. Here, your proof :) : [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/AskLeonardBot) ,  [Direct link to messenger](https://m.me/AskLeonardBot) .   

After a few months of absolute anonymity for Leonard and borderline depression for myself, Leonard has just been featured in several french newspapers and I'm going to be interviewed tomorrow for a famous french radio. Here's how it makes me feel: 

Many people think that I went full bananas for quitting my job and go for the complete unknown. I'm still far from being able to sustain a long term living out of my projects. But in the end, I know I would have died inside if I hadn't. It breaks my heart to hear from my friends that they won't quit their jobs because it's well paid, even though they hate to go there every morning. I know they might wake up in several years, probably in a less favorable economy, and realize what's happening to them. I hope it happens fast or maybe that it doesn't happen at all. I think that we still live in a world of amazing opportunities and that the risk of failing is far smaller than the risk of being depressed from not trying, and that's true about life, work, and love. 

Anyway I'm grateful for being strong enough to turn my life upside down before my will goes to sleep and I become too comfortable to move, but I know I would have never made that move if it hadn't been for my friends who have done it before me. So, if you don't have that someone or if you have any questions, go ahead, AMA!

&gt; Hi Veggit, welcome to an ‘Ask Me Anything’ with environmental journalist Gelareh Darabi.
&gt; 
&gt; Gelareh is an environmental correspondent who reports for the National Geographic 'Explorer' series and AJ+'s new climate series 'Goodbye Earth'. Previously, she worked as a science and environment corespondent for the award-wining Al Jazeera series 'Earthrise'. She has reported across five continents, in over 20 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, covering everything from rhino poaching to the water crisis in the Middle East.
&gt; 
&gt; Gelareh has attempted vegetarianism a few times, but struggled to maintain the commitment. Her recent investigation into beef as a driving industry behind deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and the access her team got into a mass feedlot and slaughterhouse has fired up a desire to give up meat once again.

e8ts4l,serhm,"I’m Seth McDuffee. Reddit made me a famous, best selling author. It’s the anniversary of my success and I’m in the process of turning my book into a television series. Ask me anything.","Hi Reddit,
 
I’m Seth McDuffee and I am (arguably) a best selling author.

On December 10th, 2018 an innocuous AskReddit answer caused my book to explode. Sales started climbing and I freaked out for several hours.
 
My book, ""Good Boy"" began as a prompt in r/WritingPrompts and saw a lot of popularity there, while I was posting weekly updates on my own subreddit.
I finally got it formatted into a novel and released it for free and sold about 6k copies in the first week. After that it lay dormant for over a year.
 
Then, someone asked ""What's Something You Are Proud of But Can't Bring Up In Normal Conversation""
 
Before falling asleep I decided to respond, saying my book had been downloaded a bunch for free and charted on Amazon, but that the last time I told someone, it was my former coworker, and he explained that it wasn't impressive because it was free.
 
Well, I woke up to thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments for people showing support and by the end of the day, had had over 1,000 downloads in six countries.
 
A few weeks later, my local paper did an article on me and a week after that [Forbes magazine](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/fernandoalfonso/2019/01/15/how-reddit-helped-this-author-sell-hundreds-of-books-almost-overnight/amp/) wrote an article about my success as well.
 
I even inexplicably sold 190 copies in Japan in under an hour during that first week! Which, as a gigantic weeb, is probably my proudest accomplishment of all.
 
Since then, I've been in contact with some very interesting people in the literary scene and I'm currently in the process of turning ""Good Boy"" into a television series.
 
The sequel to ""Good Boy"", still unnamed, will be releasing in March of 2020 and I've been working on other projects as well, soon to be released.
 
All in all, it's been a crazy year and I'm extremely fortunate and thankful to Reddit for being a large part of that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hello Reddit! I’m Faiz Shakir, campaign manager for Bernie 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite the elite media’s efforts to write off the Bernie campaign, we’re gaining momentum and growing a massive volunteer base that is going to help us win the primary, defeat Donald Trump and transform the country. We’re excited to announce that this morning we received the [endorsement of Center for Popular Democracy Action](https://twitter.com/CPDAction/status/1204354945199329280), a progressive coalition that is helping build the kind of multiracial grassroots movement we need. You can read more about that working class movement in a [great op-ed today by Professor Keeanga Yamahtta-Taylor](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/opinion/bernie-sanders-multiracial-workers.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion).  
&gt;  
&gt;This is a grassroots campaign that is not just about Bernie, but about all of us, and we want to hear your ideas and suggestions about how we can get Bernie Sanders into the White House. I’ll be taking your questions starting at 12 pm ET.  
&gt;

e8t96i,danhook,IAmA dentist in Florida here to answer any dental related questions you have and to give one of you a new smile this Christmas. Ask me anything!,"Hello again, reddit! 

I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving! My name is Dan and I am a dentist in Florida and the founder of the [12 Arches of Christmas program](www.12arches.com), a pro bono program we created to find 6-12 unsuspecting individuals once a year around the holidays in need of dental work and gift them a 48-hour full-mouth reconstruction, complete with permanent dental implants and custom milled hybrid bridges designed specifically for their mouths, known as the Done In One procedure. 

For anyone just tuning in, we had a 21-year-old female suffering from amelogenesis imperfecta who made a post on r/IAmA a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, with the two jobs she is juggling in order to support herself through college, she was forced to decline the offer. Personally, I admire her prioritization and the dedication she had shown in responding to nearly each and every post in that thread. I won't include her username again just in case she isn't keen on any further distraction but if you're already familiar with the post, maybe drop her a line and some well-wishes for the holidays. Having put myself through college, as I'm sure a lot of you have, we all know how trying that period of our lives can be. She's one of the good ones. 

Moving on: We still have an opening in our 12 Arches program and, as is tradition, it wouldn't be complete without a redditor filling that spot. I honestly have my own personal hesitance towards presenting this as some kind of giveaway and it being erroneously perceived as some kind of PR stunt, which is why I always reach out directly to a redditor I feel is a good candidate for the 12 Arches program. But time is running short, we *need* a redditor to continue the tradition, and let's be real: this is reddit, it's going to be seen as a r/hailcorporate post anyway. 🤷🏻‍♂️ What can I do? 

Here to help me answer any questions you all may have is last year's lucky redditor, u/mikeytruant850. Mike has began working with our company as a treatment coordinator and is unique in that he can answer any questions with regards to actually being in the chair and receiving the procedure. Here is [his 12 Arches story](https://vimeo.com/307088451) from last year. 

**Just to answer a few questions off the bat:**

**1**) *If you have DMed me (via chat or private message), your username is already in the hat. If you made a comment in the previous IAmA stating that you're in need, you are as well. You will not be overlooked, but feel free to comment in this post as well. You are free (encouraged even) to share your story here again if you'd like. Believe it or not, your stories provide solace to a lot of people who are realizing more and more that they are not alone.*

**2**) *There were hundreds of messages simply asking for more information. I apologize that I am unable to get back to each of you individually but this AmA is also to provide that very information - whether about our procedure, dentistry in general, our 12 Arches of Christmas program, or in regards to pineapple on pizza (absolutely). If you have questions regarding the steps you should be taking towards improving your smile, you can ask them here.*

**3**) *One horse-sized duck.*

The concept of the 12 Arches of Christmas program was basically born here on reddit so this is just my chance to give back to the community. You can check my account age, my post history... I'm just a redditor in a position to help a few of you guys out for Christmas. I appreciate all the kind words and well wishes you've all sent but it really is my pleasure to be in a position to help anyone who hasn't been smiling lately to do so this holiday season. 

**Lastly, this is kinda something I do on my own, outside of the company, for you guys. I'd like to keep this confined to us, so reaching out beyond this forum to inquire about the pro bono aspect isn't necessary and may even hamper my ability to offer this program every year. Let's keep this online.**

Okay reddit, ask away!

Hi, Reddit. I post sometimes in [r/wallstreetbets](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets) and was urged to share my quirky story here. 

I'm in my late 30s, unmarried. My job - I give mostly mid-to-large sized privately owned businesses guidance on their regulatory compliance, I come in and give an outsider's thoughts on what they are going currently and on what they can do better. A lot of the time I come in after an epic massive screw up that's cost people a ton of money and a their jobs, so that's always fun figuring out what exactly happened. So many times it boils down to outright carelessness or woefully unqualified people making decisions that they shouldn't be in the position to make. It's a non-practicing legal job.

The money - I got out of law school in the 2000s and started investing in the stock market in the years before the Great Recession happened, so I was deep in the red right off the bat. I moved home with mom out of school so I could peg my expenses as low as possible so I could pay my massive student loan debt in under a year. Once that was gone, I stayed frugal and saved a couple hundred thousand dollars. After the Fed enacted the TARP rescue program and I realized the government wasn't going to allow any more core banks to fail, I invested almost everything I had and kept doing it into what I now know is the greatest, longest market rally of my lifetime. I got lucky. If I came into my savings at any other point in recent history, I would still be doing well but not nearly this well. I am grateful.

My mom - I've always been close to her because of the Asian momma's boy stereotype being true in the case, also because her English isn't great so I always need to be reasonably close by to help her with bills or anything complicated. she is in her 60s and became disabled in recent years with nerve damage in her leg. She can walk, she just needs someone to hold on to sometimes and someone to always carry her heavy walker out of the car, so that's become me. She's largely stopped driving on her own as a result.

As to the secret, I mean she's not stupid, she knows I have had a nice job and live comfortably. I pay for her shopping most of the time and give her cash gifts of maybe 50 to 100 bucks at a time all the time, as well as larger cash gifts on Christmas, birthdays, and so forth. But she clearly is unaware of how much wealth it is because she asks for so little comparatively and still agonizes over any small purchase and feels so guilty taking anything from me. My bank and investment statements are all electronic, so she can't accidentally stumble on any paper proof, either.

I don't tell her because I have not told anyone IRL. I don't want people knowing because I see how people treat folks who claim to have money and I want no part of it. And I don't want to ever be that obnoxious 40/50yo guy bragging to IRL strangers to make friends/gfs (hypocritical given this thread, yes). I've met several and it is sad. And I know how much of an gossip she is with her lady friends, she tells them whenever I do something embarrassing or about any tiny achievement in my life, zero chance she would keep something like this secret. Within a day of me telling her, she would have a line of female strangers in my driveway ready for me to choose.

e8ih5e,dc0077,"I graduated high school with a 2.4 GPA, struggled through college, and now make $240k/yr in big tech (FAANG) product management. AMA","Hi Reddit! A couple of my friends suggested that I do one of these because they thought my story was interesting and unusual. This is a throwaway account so I can be completely upfront with any answers. 

I have always been a very poor student, but an effective autodidact. I learn much more quickly through independent research and doing than being taught. As such, I have always had poor grades. I graduated high school with a 2.4 GPA, having nearly failed many classes which are actually best-suited to my skill-set (math, science). I did however, do quite well on standardized tests (31 composite score on ACT). 

Out of high school, I went to a very small state school in the state I grew up in that is infamous for drinking and partying. It's basically where people go when they can't get into any of the top public schools in the state. Last I checked, it was ranked #240 in the country. Not exactly stellar.

After my sophomore year, I decided I needed to get out of the state at all costs. The weather, social environment and lack of outdoor activities were bad for me. I moved west to a new state and started at a community college with a plan of bringing up my grades to get into one of the top schools in that state. I got my grades up at the community college and, after a year, started at the new university, a school consistently ranked in the top 25 in the country. 

There, I studied a non-technical arts &amp; sciences field. I never had much interest in school and just wanted to get a degree for security and to appease my family.  During my junior year, I started coding for fun on side projects. I contributed to some open source projects and did some contract work as well. My senior year I started a small software business, for which I coded the MVP myself.

I graduated in 2014 with very meh grades (2.7 GPA), but by that time my university and two others had become clients of my business, as well as a few large business enterprises. My business was accepted into a local accelerator program and everything seemed to be going great. We raised a small seed round and started hiring. Some of our investors were extremely well-known and connected serial entrepreneurs. However, in 2016 and 2017, sweeping API ToS changes on social media platforms crippled our business and we were unable to stretch funding long enough to pivot. We had to close our doors.

So with a non-technical degree, poor grades, and a failed business under my belt, I applied for PM jobs at FAANG companies in the hopes that someone would see value in my experience (and failures). I got offers from 3 different FAANG companies and took one, starting in 2018. I have been consistently highly rated and told by my management I have a bright future at the company. I took a very unusual route, but ended up surrounded by people who got MBA or MS degrees from Ivy League schools. 

I'm sharing this to answer questions and help kids in similar situations. You know you're smart, you know you're valuable, you know what you want, but school just doesn't work for you or you have been slacking and think it's too late to turn it around. You can still make it happen. Ask me anything.

What is Aerotoxic Syndrome? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXf7MvI-nhU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXf7MvI-nhU) 

Countless aircrew and passengers have their health and livelihoods ruined by accidentally being in an OIL FUME EVENT or SLOWLY BEING POISONED over many years and face a challenging time - all the while feeling like a zombie.

Because survivors have a collection of mysterious symptoms which GP’s aren’t trained to recognise, they face the prospect of gross misdiagnosis and mistreatment – which turns their lives upside down even more….

All may look well on the outside, but with tremoring fingers – this is a sure sign of poisoning!

At my worst, I could only speak up to five words, had severe memory loss and my personality changed. I felt like a zombie. Aerotoxic Syndrome robbed me of my life and continues to rob hundreds of thousands more. 

But the good news is that there ARE NOW KNOWN solutions both for the airlines and also for YOU.

I have done my best over the past 12 years to help others, but in so doing - I have neglected my own welfare. Along with the BBC ban of any mention of AEROTOXIC on the radio or on TV, the Aerotoxic Association has been run into the ground and now is fighting for survival financially!

Your support will help us to expose the unfiltered truth and vote for the known solutions, every bit counts.

I had a seizure switching unexpectedly three Alters with no control. I blanked, waking up after the session, leaving my coach rather speechless at first. Gladly she did not run away and kinda opened up to two my Alters, who had enough of hiding. Our coach became very supportive, though she has very hard time to not look into my face with an expression like I am batshit crazy when she talks and listens to Romy. 

My Alters and I started a co-writing project of short stories about a life with multiple identities. 

And - again Romy - nagged so desperately to use an online account of some sort to communicate. So here we are to post WiPs and final chapters in the near future and are already working on the next stage of project. 

We have a dog called Sanctum, who can tell us apart - so Jeanne claims.

Every year I (along with my podcast co-hosts) produce a holiday gala to raise money for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and this year (our 4th) will be the best one yet, raising money and collecting toys for these awesome kids. In years past we’ve had a crazy live auction with giant Funko statues, a samurai sword signed by Randy Jackson, a date with male supermodel Fabio, and even a robot that makes pancakes. This year will be even better!

I will be answering whatever questions you have for me starting at 12pm PST.

Ask me whatever your heart desires and please help us raise money for an amazing cause!

e7tljg,Oax_Mike,"Reddit's Favorite (I hope) Hospitality Entrepreneur: AMA about building, owning and operating a boutique hotel...or about living in Mexico, having 7 cats &amp; dogs, teaching English overseas or whatever tickles your fancy","10 years ago my wife and I bought a parcel of land just off a quiet beach in Mexico with the idea that we'd quit our university teaching jobs and spend every last penny of our life savings building a small beach hotel. 

A year and a half later we did just that.

\~2.5 years of construction nearly broke us in every way imaginable but with each passing season of being open the nightmare that is building fades further and further into the distance. 

It's been a wild ride with incredible highs and lows. From ""Holy shit, I can't believe this is our life!"" to getting the plunger to dislodge some stranger's shit from the toilet bowl. We've met tons of amazing and interesting people and a handful of people who aren't welcome back, haha.

When we made the original decision to take this leap we figured that it was at minimum a 10-year investment. We're not quite 10 years in (April 1 makes 9 years in Mexico) but at this point we're definitely ready to sign on for another decade - even if we'll likely one day sell and move on to another adventure, simply for the sake of adventure.

Ask me anything except for the exact investment amount. That always gets asked when I do these...but let's just say that it cost approximately what you'd pay for a 3-bedroom house in the suburbs of a major city in the US but not a super expensive one like Seattle, SF, NY, LA or similar.

Completely unrelated slash bizarre questions are welcomed and encouraged.

# BAGAIMANA CARA KERJA TURNAMEN SLOT?

Ada beberapa format yang berbeda untuk turnamen slot dapat mengambil tetapi mereka semua pada dasarnya bekerja pada prinsip yang sama. Semua pemain mendaftar untuk turnamen dan mendapatkan sejumlah kredit di mesin slot. Mereka kemudian memiliki kerangka waktu yang ditetapkan untuk menjalankan kredit itu menjadi sebanyak ""keuntungan"" sebanyak mungkin. Kredit turnamen dikompilasi dalam akun kredit terpisah pada mesin sehingga tidak ditambahkan atau dikurangi dari kredit awal yang Anda tetapkan.

Satu-satunya tujuan Anda adalah menggunakan semua kredit yang Anda alokasikan dalam waktu yang diizinkan dan berharap Anda mendapatkan jackpot yang cukup besar (atau kecil) untuk mendorong kredit total yang dimenangkan Anda setinggi mungkin. Pembayaran untuk turnamen kemudian didistribusikan kepada para pemain sesuai dengan jadwal pembayaran yang telah ditentukan. Misalnya, pemain dengan kredit terbanyak memenangkan $ 1.000, peringkat kedua memenangkan $ 500 dan $ 300 ketiga. Baik uang tunai dan hadiah dapat didistribusikan dan jumlah pemenang dapat bervariasi dari hanya pemain dengan kredit terbanyak atau 10-20% teratas dll.

Itu benar-benar tergantung pada casino dan penawarannya. Beberapa turnamen slot http://rphqq.vip untuk dimasuki; casino menawarkan mereka untuk mendatangkan pemain baru dan memberi mereka kesempatan untuk merasa nyaman dengan memainkan slot sebelum mempertaruhkan uang mereka sendiri. Hadiah dalam turnamen slot gratis umumnya kecil, tapi tetap saja - sesuatu tanpa imbalan selalu merupakan tawaran bagus.

Turnamen slot lainnya dibuat oleh casino untuk memberi pemain slot sering hadiah atas seberapa sering mereka bermain di casino itu. Jika Anda sering menjadi pemain slot, Anda tahu bahwa Anda dapat memperoleh banyak poin pemain dengan memutar gulungan-gulungan itu dan seringkali Anda bisa mengubahnya menjadi entri turnamen slot dengan hadiah sungguhan. Semakin banyak turnamen slot sebenarnya memiliki buy-in tunai nyata (mis. $ 50) dan semua uang diakumulasikan ke dalam kumpulan hadiah yang kemudian didistribusikan di antara para pemenang sesuai dengan jadwal persentase yang ditentukan seperti disebutkan di atas.

Jumlah hadiah tergantung pada jumlah pemain di turnamen. Semakin banyak pemain dengan buy-in tinggi, semakin tinggi jackpotnya. Casino juga mengambil sebagian kecil dari jumlah yang dikumpulkan ini. Turnamen slot terbesar dapat melibatkan ribuan pemain dan menciptakan kumpulan hadiah besar. Mereka biasanya akan memiliki beberapa putaran yang harus Anda lewati (mis. Letakkan di persentase atas papan peringkat) sebelum sampai ke babak final di mana uang dibagikan. Format hadiah bisa sangat bervariasi, dengan semua jenis uang tunai atau hadiah diberikan untuk berbagai posisi.

**Catatan: Anda tidak benar-benar memenangkan jumlah kredit yang Anda miliki di mesin; itu murni untuk posisi Anda sesuai dengan skema pembayaran turnamen.**

So my brother has always been a picky eater for the longest time, and has only slightly gotten better. This extreme picky eating is called Arfid. He has such a distaste for chicken, fish, salad, etc.. we have to cook him special meals and he gags when around them. He’s 16. I read somewhere it’s caused from being spoiled during meals. But I can disprove his case, as some nights he’s stayed at the table for a couple hours because he doesn’t want to touch the certain “chicken” or “fish”. And we could probably tackle it, but he’s loud and strong, and would obviously retaliate.

Now onto my sister, she’s 18, and used to be fat. Either somebody body shamed her or she did it to herself... but over the course of 5ish months, she got herself the eating disorder anorexia. I’m pretty sure most of you know what anorexia is, the complete distaste for food or complete ignorance for it. It mainly worsened at college and she had to leave after she passed out of going without food for 2 days. She recently went to an eating disorder clinic. And is still working on it.

Side Note; My sister case went from serious —&gt; mild &amp; my brothers is just a moderate case.

But still thought it would be a good opportunity for some questions, since I’ve learned a lot over the past couple of months. Well... AMA!",1,1575770987,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e7nm9y/both_of_my_siblings_have_eating_disorders_ask_me/,IAmA,1

I've also done work for direct-to-DVD movies such as The Underground Comedy Movie and Inappropriate Comedy.

And I've also never had a beat up anybody in my life. Specifically in Miami Beach to put that out there. No sir, totally nothing happened there.
