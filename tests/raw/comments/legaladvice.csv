Title: **Landlord sent me to collections w/o an outstanding balance**

Original Post: 

&gt; Rent is due tomorrow. My landlord (a company) called me this afternoon checking to see ""how we were doing."" What I told the lady was the truth, ""We're fine this month, although if this isolation continues we might be in trouble."" 
&gt; 
&gt; But then, several hours later I received a call from a collections agency saying that my landlord sent me to them. I double-checked after the call, and I have no outstanding debt, and we're still on schedule to pay tomorrow. They said my address and the name of the complex, so I'm pretty sure it's legit. He hung up after I said I was disputing that claim.  
&gt; If it is legit, what's going on here?? Is my landlord just pre-sending their tenants to collections? I'm very curious if this has happened to anyone else. I'm inclined to join in on the rent strike movement if my landlord is gonna act this sketchy.

fm47c44,FrnchsLwyr,1585748240,False,legaladvice,t3_fsocil,"If you don't owe the LL any money, then it would be improper to send you to collections.  A debt that is not owed cannot legally be sent to a collection agency and, importantly, an agency cannot collect on a debt that does not exist.

If your LL did send you to a collection agency, you are right to determine there was no outstanding balance and dispute the debt.  Now you need to *properly document this*.  ONE good idea would be to send your LL a letter (preferably certified mail, but emails work if you have an email address you know they check regularly) explaining the calls you received from LL and collection agent, asking if they sent you to collections and, if so, what debt was owed.  Request a written response.  **SAVE THAT EMAIL AND ANY REPLIES**.

(Congratulations, you've just created documentary evidence that something happened and the steps you took so far.)

Also, make sure you pay rent this month on time - it's likely your LL will try to send you to collections if you do not.  

You should also review your lease - most residential leases have grace periods to pay rent (5 days if what i most often see), and late fee provisions.  So, even if you were late on rent, the proper action to take would be to send a demand for payment and include the late fee after the grace period as ""additional rent"" under the lease.  

Sending a tenant who is 1 month behind to collections is like killing a cockroach with a blowtorch: you're going to lose more than you gain when it's all said and done.",t3_fsocil,True

fm4s4dv,MadMotthew,1585759793,False,legaladvice,t3_fsocil,"If you remember the name of the collection company, I would google the name to see if it is a legitimate company. If they call back make sure you say you want to dispute the debt and they should send you some paperwork back to fill out. Additionally, if this is the first time they've contacted you, they're required under the FDCPA to send you written notice within 5 days detailing information about the debt if you haven't received anything in the mail from them yet.  


You also could send a letter to their company saying you dispute the debt and then under the FDCPA they have to stop any collection activity until they send you verification of the debt. Also when you spoke with them, do you recall if they said, ""I am a debt collector attempting to collect a debt, any information obtained will be used for that purpose."" If they failed to use that language before speaking with you, that is also a FDCPA violation.   


I would document every time they speak with you, keep notes about what they say to you (especially if they don't give the mini Miranda warning), and I would not say much more other than, ""I am disputing the debt. I have never missed a rental payment.""
