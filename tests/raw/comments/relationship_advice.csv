All that said, I think this actually has to do with the current lifestyle you both have, and less to do about you. The hardest thing you can throw at a relationship is lack of time together, period.

I'm saying this because I find it strange that she brought up being unsure of whether you're actually going to change or if you'll be faking it. Usually situational behavioral changes in a significant other should not make someone question their relationship with them entirely.

If you didn't take your stress out on her and it's solely just an issue of you being moody, I'd try to call or FaceTime with her as much as you can and try to make things feel like how your relationship felt before all the stress came into your life.

Even if you just rent a room or share a home with some roommates, it will give you the independence you desire. If you do that but still can’t bring your bf home because of roommate rules or whatever, then stay in a hotel with him every so often.

Your mom has no obligation to change and it’s her house. Still, if you have to stay with her, you can accommodate yourself. If you have an IPhone you can watch Netflix “immoral” movies on it with headphones. You can be intimate with bf during daylight hours somewhere else. In short, you can make it work.
