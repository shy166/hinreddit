This is funny to me as it is pretty indicative of one's age. 

Yeah - the Bulldozer architecture was ROUGH from 2010 to 2016. There's no getting around the fact that the Bulldozer architecture straight sucked. They made the same mistake that Intel made with the Pentium 4 (i.e. the CPU doesn't have to be elegantly designed if you can just keep cranking up the clockspeed). But prior to that, and especially from around 2002-2007 AMD was kicking Intel's ass left-and-right.
