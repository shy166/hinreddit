fm2kw4x,disclosure5,1585699566,False,sysadmin,t3_fsnq0w,"&gt;I see people using the commands setup.exe /PrepareSchema and PrepareAD before starting the upgrade. Is this needed before starting every CU upgrade?

In a small deployment it usually doesn't matter. The problem is ""it depends"". It needs to be done in the same AD site as your schema master, and the first Exchange server you update may not be in that site. So a ""best practice"" means running these commands on a suitable machine in advance.

It definitely is a ""per domain"" thing. It doesn't need to be done on every server, in fact you can follow the above point and run it on a machine not even running Exchange.

It's not required for every CU but it's needed for many of them and it never hurts, so again best practice says just do it.",t3_fsnq0w,True
